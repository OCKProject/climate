<p id="Par7" class="p">We have carried out a systematic analysis of similarity and dissimilarity in bias structures of CMIP5 and AMIP5 models in simulating the partitioning of precipitation between the convective and large-scale components. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> shows the hierarchical structure of CMIP5 models for total precipitation simulation. Models developed either at the same center (same color) or at different centers falling in the same branch (see Section 2 for details on methodology used for branching) show large similarity in total precipitation simulation, whereas models in the farthest branches show highest dissimilarity. From Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>, and from Knutti

 </sup>, we found some of the obvious similarities between same center or between different center models shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> are arising due to the similarities in atmospheric component in spite of having different ocean components or inclusion of ocean biogeochemistry, and atmospheric chemistry. In other words, if two climate models either from the same center or different centers have the same atmospheric component their total precipitation bias is very similar, irrespective of the other components. For example, ACCESS and HadGEM show high similarity, even though they have only the atmospheric component in common. The level of similarity is very similar to model pairs that have lot more common components than that shared between ACCESS and HadGEM. For example, the level of similarity between ACCESS and HadGEM is not very different than that between: (i) MIROC-ESM-CHEM and MIROC-ESM (the former having an additional component in the form of the atmospheric chemistry package), (ii) NorESM1-ME and NorESM1-M (the former having an additional component in the form of the ocean biogeochemistry package), (iii) GISS-E2R-CC and GISS-E2R (the former having an additional component in the form of carbon cycle package), (iv) HadGEM2-ES and HadGEM2-CC (the former having an additional component in the form of atmospheric chemistry package), and (v) GFDL-ESM2G and GFDL-ESM2M (the former having different ocean component). Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> also shows large dissimilarity between model pairs that started with a similar parent atmospheric component that underwent significant modification during model development. For example, dissimilarity seen between (i) MIROC-4h/5 and MIROC-ESM/ESM-CHEM, (ii) GFDL-CM3 and GFDL-ESM2G/2M, and (iii) CCSM4 and CESM-CAM5, are due to significant modifications in the atmospheric components during the model development process.
