<p class="p">Such a transition from a wet to a moisture-limited regime is associated with an increase in the sensitivity of LH to soil moisture fluctuations (even in the absence of any changes in available radiation) (

 <italic class="italic">LH</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sub class="sub">d</sub> can therefore potentially reveal information on the mechanisms behind changes in variability. In agreement with the soil moisture hypothesis, increased temperature variability is associated with substantial increases in the variability of LH (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Fig. 2C</xref>). The SD of 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sub class="sub">d</sub> and LH both increase to a similar extent, and thus, both contribute to increased temperature variability. However, as the changes in EF and soil moisture show, 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sub class="sub">d</sub> cannot be the sole driver of the increased temperature variability because there is no clear reason why the increased SD of 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sub class="sub">d</sub> would systematically deplete the mean soil moisture. Instead, we suggest that the SD increase in downwelling radiation in these areas is at least partly associated with land-atmosphere feedbacks. For example, surface drying can affect cloud distribution and, hence, the variability of 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sub class="sub">d</sub>. To separate these effects quantitatively, specific additional model simulations would be needed.
