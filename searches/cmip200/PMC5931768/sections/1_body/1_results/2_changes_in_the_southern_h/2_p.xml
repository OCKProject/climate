<p class="p">From a local perspective, fluctuations in the downwelling radiation (short-wave plus long-wave fluxes) at the surface, 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sub class="sub">d</sub>, can be seen as a direct atmospheric driver of temperature changes, which determines how much energy is available at the surface. We do not consider changes in surface albedo here because its contribution to monthly variability is likely small. We recognize that local conditions can feed back to the atmosphere (for example, via changes in cloud cover) to affect 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sub class="sub">d</sub>, but note that 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sub class="sub">d</sub> is also determined by processes on larger scales. A second important parameter is the evaporative fraction (EF) (the part of the available energy at the surface used to evaporate water), here calculated as 
 <italic class="italic">EF</italic> = 
 <italic class="italic">LH</italic>/(
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sub class="sub">u</sub> + 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sub class="sub">d</sub>), with upwelling radiation 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sub class="sub">u</sub> and latent heat flux (LH). Because an increase in sensible heat flux is associated with temperature increase, whereas increased LH is not, EF determines by how much a change in atmospheric forcing translates into temperature change. The smaller the EF becomes, the greater the effect of variations in available net radiation on temperature, because more radiation is converted into sensible instead of latent heat.
