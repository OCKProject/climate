<p class="p">Previous studies have shown that changes in soil moisture affect the partitioning of surface fluxes mostly in intermediate moisture regimes (

  <italic class="italic">30</italic>
 </xref>). Where evapotranspiration is limited by moisture but still has a substantial contribution to the energy balance, soil moisture has the largest effect on LH or temperature (and hence their variability). In this context, it is striking that regions with substantial increases in temperature variability coincide with regions identified as hotspots of strong soil moisture temperature coupling in previous studies (

 </xref>, 
 <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">31</italic>
 </xref>). We therefore analyze how increases in temperature variability are related to changes in soil moisture and EF, in comparison to variations in downwelling radiation

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Figure 2A</xref> shows that the grid cells where temperature variability increases (red on the color scale) tend to have decreasing soil moisture (horizontal axis) as well as increasing variability in

 <sub class="sub">d</sub> (vertical axis). The same relation emerges when plotting EF instead of soil moisture (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Fig. 2B</xref>). Therefore, the changes in the Southern Hemisphere hotspots are consistent with the explanation that soil moisture loss leads to smaller EF and thus larger temperature variability. Even in the humid climate of Amazonia where evapotranspiration is limited by radiation in many places, the large future drying brings the region closer to a soil moistureâ€“limited regime, which is associated with a large reduction in the positive correlation between evapotranspiration and incoming radiation (fig. S5).
