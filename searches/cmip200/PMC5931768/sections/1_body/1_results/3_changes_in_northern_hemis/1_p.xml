<p class="p">The Northern Hemisphere shows a very different pattern (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Fig. 2D</xref>). This occurs because soil moisture does not limit EF in many places, so that decreases in soil moisture do not necessarily cause increased temperature variability. Moreover, changes in EF alone cannot explain the increased temperature variability in the Northern Hemisphere (
