<p class="p">This pattern suggests that changes in the atmosphere on a regional scale are an important driver of the changes in variability at the surface. When we compare changes in the variability of 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sub class="sub">d</sub> and LH in the Northern Hemisphere summer, we find two distinct regimes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Fig. 2F</xref>). The horizontal (bottom-right) branch with substantial increases in LH variability is consistent with the soil-drying mechanism explained above. Because 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sub class="sub">d</sub> variability does not increase or even decreases, the soil moisture loss must be solely responsible for the enhanced temperature variability. In contrast, the vertical (upper) branch in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Fig. 2F</xref> consists of dry regions where other mechanisms dominate, whereas changes in LH variability are small.
