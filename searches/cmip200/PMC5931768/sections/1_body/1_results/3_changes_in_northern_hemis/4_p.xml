<p class="p">Because model agreement tends to be lower in India and the Sahel than in other hotspots (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref> and fig. S1), we also calculate model averages for only the models showing an increase in temperature SD in a given region. In India, the SD of rainfall, soil moisture, cloud cover, and LH all increase despite little changes in mean soil moisture. This indicates that the Indian summer monsoon in the models is becoming more variable under greenhouse forcing, a result that is confirmed by other studies (

 </xref>). A similar effect occurs in Southeast Asia (
 <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">36</italic>
 </xref>), in combination with a mean soil moisture decrease, causing an additional SD increase in temperature. In the Sahel, summer rainfall protrudes further north in those models showing a clear increase in temperature SD. Where the preindustrial climate has been almost permanently dry, an increased occurrence of cloudier and wetter months promotes increased variability in both radiation and LH. Moreover, because the Sahara warms more than the vegetated regions to the South, the meridional temperature gradient in the Sahel region is enhanced (fig. S4B). This enhancement of variability due to the increased spatial temperature contrast is hence the reversed mechanism of the decreased variability in mid-latitudes. An increased temperature gradient is also the reason for the zone of large SD increase surrounding the Arctic Ocean (fig. S4A), which warms much less than the land.
