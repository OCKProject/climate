<p class="p">We loosely define hotspots as regions of relatively large variability changes that also show a large model agreement on the sign of the change. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Figure 1</xref> shows the projected relative changes in SD of monthly temperature anomalies until the end of the 21st century, averaged over all 37 models (see fig. S1 for model agreement). Several hotspots of increases in SD are revealed over (sub)tropical land, namely, Amazonia, Southern Africa, Australia, the Sahel, the Arabian Peninsula, India, and Southeast Asia. In boreal summer, large increases occur over Europe, North America, and near the Arctic coast (
