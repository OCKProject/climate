<p class="p">Absolute changes in variability are greatest in mid- and high latitudes in boreal autumn and winter (fig. S2), but these are also regions with the largest background levels of temperature variability. In relative terms, the largest changes in SD are increases of up to 40% in Amazonia and Southern Africa in austral spring and summer. Using temperature anomalies from all months of the year, Amazonia stands out as a region with a particularly large relative SD increase (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1C</xref>) because increases occur in all seasons. Although the models agree on the sign of change, the magnitude differs substantially between the models, with some models showing a doubling of SD in the tropical hotspots, especially in central and northern Amazonia. The changes continue in the nine models extended beyond 2100 and scale approximately with global warming. In the model average, each degree of global warming leads to an ~15% increase in SD in Amazonia, Southern Africa, and the Arctic coast during the local summer season, and a 10% increase in the subtropical hotspots of the Northern Hemisphere (fig. S3).
