This is not feasible across all of the CMIP5 models; hence, we take a different approach and analyze the changes in the terms contributing to the surface energy balance in the model mean, and identify important regional differences. In high latitudes, decreases in temperature SD are particularly pronounced over regions with sea-ice loss because the exposed ocean introduces a much larger heat capacity. This leads to more persistent but damped anomalies (

 </xref>), in other words, SD decreases. Reductions in SD in mid-latitudes are not directly related to Arctic sea-ice loss. The largest SD decrease in the Arctic occurs in autumn [September, October, and November (SON)], the season with the largest sea-ice loss until 2100, whereas the SD decrease in mid-latitudes is most pronounced during Northern Hemisphere winter (DJF), the season where Arctic amplification is largest (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref> and fig. S2). This amplification of mean warming in high northern latitudes leads to a reduced meridional temperature gradient (fig. S4). If one assumes that typical wind patterns do not change, then incoming air from the North or South is less different in temperature than it was when the temperature gradient weakens, leading to smaller local temperature anomalies. Calculating the monthly anomalies of advection (the local temperature tendencies due to horizontal wind) indeed reveals a decrease of the advection-induced temperature variability (fig. S4). We thereby confirm previous studies showing that the decreased temperature variability in mid-latitudes is associated with a decreased meridional temperature gradient due to the polar amplification of global warming (
