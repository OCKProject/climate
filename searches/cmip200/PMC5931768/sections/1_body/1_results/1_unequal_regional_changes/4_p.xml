<p class="p">The increases of temperature variability that we find are largest in the season of maximum insolation (fig. S2). In the following, we therefore focus on the summer season. In the Southern Hemisphere, the results are qualitatively similar in all seasons. In the Northern Hemisphere, the summer season is the only season with an increased SD of temperature anomalies, whereas SD decreases in all other seasons (for the reasons described above). The large increases in SD over tropical land are particularly striking and have not been explained in previous analyses.</p>
