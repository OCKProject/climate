 </xref>) recently raised the question whether the predictions of the models are reliable or whether they share common biases in their predictions of temperature extremes, despite the overall agreement regarding the magnitude of observed variability. In the case that the model predictions are correct, the question arises whether the anthropogenic fingerprint is already apparent in observations of temperature variability. We therefore recalculate the changes in temperature SD for the period from 1958 to 2017 and compare the result to two observational data sets based on in situ measurements from meteorological stations: HadCRUT4 (

 </xref>). These data sets report temperatures whose mean and variance have been standardized with a reference period. This procedure is known to introduce biases in variance changes (
