<p class="p">In a recent companion study (

 </xref>), we have shown that the sign of the observed temperature trends substantially depends on the choice of the time period, which confirms that the observed changes are largely related to internal climate variability and not a forced trend. The relatively robust decrease of observed variability over high northern latitudes in the North Atlantic region, however, might already be part of the anthropogenic signal (associated with sea-ice loss). Unfortunately, the regions with the largest model agreement in

It is therefore hard to conclude whether current observations confirm or refute the predictions of models regarding trends in monthly temperature variability.
