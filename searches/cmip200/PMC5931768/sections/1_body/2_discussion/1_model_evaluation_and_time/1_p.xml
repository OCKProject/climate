<p class="p">The mechanisms that we identify above are in line with previous studies that have usually focused on temperature extremes (extreme compared to current climate) and on shorter time scales (

 <xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">44</italic>
 </xref>). Although locally constrained by observations, these reanalysis data sets allow a global and temporally complete coverage. We calculate the temperature SD in the period 1980â€“2010 for all models and the four reanalyses by linear detrending for each month and computing the SD of the residuals. Overall, our comparison confirms that the current temperature SD of the CMIP5 models is within the observational range (fig. S6). Regional biases occur mostly in high latitudes over areas of substantial variability in sea-ice cover and over some tropical land regions (fig. S6A). However, these model mean biases are comparable in magnitude with the typical differences between models (fig. S6B) and, over some regions, are also comparable to the differences between reanalysis data sets (fig. S6C).
