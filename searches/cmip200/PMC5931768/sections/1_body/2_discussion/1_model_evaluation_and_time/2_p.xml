<p class="p">CMIP5 models are particularly uncertain and biased in the Amazon. Although most models show a pronounced hotspot of future temperature SD increase, this is also the region where the magnitude of this increase is most uncertain. Overall, the regions that the models identify as hotspots of future temperature SD increase tend to have a positive bias, that is, the model average shows larger present-day variability than reanalyses (fig. S6A). However, selecting groups of models based on their overall sign of biases hardly affects the general pattern of changing temperature variability. Although there is a tendency for models with positive bias to also show larger increases in temperature SD in many places, this bias is relatively small compared to the predicted changes in most hotspot areas, and the position of hotspots and the relative magnitude of temperature variability changes in these regions are not substantially affected.</p>
