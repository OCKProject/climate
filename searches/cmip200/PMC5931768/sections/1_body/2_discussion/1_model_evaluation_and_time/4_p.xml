<p class="p">At first sight, the observations do not agree well with the signal in the model predictions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>). The most apparent features in observations are an increase in temperature SD in the Mediterranean region and a decrease in some parts of North America and Northern Europe (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>, A and B). In contrast, the tendencies of changes in temperature SD in the models already show the overall pattern that we analyzed above when all models are considered (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Fig. 4C</xref>). However, the model agreement is still relatively low, and the characteristic contrast between high and low latitudes is not apparent in individual models with very few exceptions. If we assume that each model is one realization of climate variability in the real world, then this means that we cannot expect to see the anthropogenic signal in recent observations. It is only during the 21st century that the signal emerges in the large majority of the models, with more than 80% of the models agreeing on the sign until 2100 over subtropical land and the mid- and high latitudes (fig. S1). Although the sign of variability change in observations can be very clear at places (indicated by a large absolute Kendall Ï„ value), these observations still provide only one realization.
