<p class="p">On the basis of the econometric studies mentioned above, it is hard to conclude what the exact impacts of changing climate variability will be. For example, it is important to assess to what extent the impacts caused by warm climate anomalies are compensated by cold anomalies. In general, an increase in temperature variability is arguably more difficult to cope with than a decrease in variability. Societies and ecosystems are typically adapted to a certain long-term climate at any particular locationâ€”the more an anomaly deviates from the local mean, the more damage it can thus cause. This is particularly important in the presence of critical thresholds, for example, in species performance (

 </xref>), indicating that the effects of warm and cold anomalies will not simply cancel out. Moreover, the distribution of daily temperature is projected to become more skewed to warm anomalies in many of the identified hotspot locations (

 </xref>). It therefore seems plausible that, overall, the projected increases in temperature variability would have negative consequences for nature and society.
