<p class="p">To illustrate this, we calculate the relative changes in temperature SD for individual countries, omitting small countries that are usually not resolved in the models (see Materials and Methods). It is particularly striking that the geographical pattern of the changes in SD coincides closely with the current distribution of wealth on the national level (

Although temperature fluctuations are projected to become smaller in countries having a large per capita gross domestic product (GDP), they tend to increase in countries with low GDP. Hence, countries facing the largest increases in temperature variability also have the least economic potential to cope with the impacts. The countries affected by this dual challenge of poverty and increasing variability already share half of the worldâ€™s population (
