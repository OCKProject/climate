<p class="p">The unequal changes in projected climate variability are also a challenge for climate justice regarding the contributions of different nations to global climate change. Considering the average per capita emissions in the period 1990–2015 (excluding land use change and forestry), countries with the smallest emissions tend to have the largest increases in variability (fig. S7A), whereas those with the largest emissions tend to have smaller increases or even decreases in variability (Australia being a notable exception). The picture changes somewhat when including recent emissions from land use change and forestry (fig. S7B), bearing in mind that land use–related emissions are much more uncertain than emission estimates from fossil fuel burning. In the selected time period, tropical countries contributed a large fraction to land use–related emissions, associated with tropical deforestation especially in sub-Saharan Africa, Amazonia, and Southeast Asia.</p>
