<p class="p">We used two observational temperature data sets, based on in situ measurements from meteorological stations: HadCRUT4 (
 <xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">45</italic>
 </xref>) and the GISTEMP (
 <xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">46</italic>
 </xref>). The latter data set has been interpolated over a scale of 1200 km to fill spatial gaps between stations, which is the reason for the very uniform changes in the Arctic in fig. S8 (
 <xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">46</italic>
 </xref>). Because these data sets report temperature as standardized anomalies, we did not calculate absolute changes in variability, but only the direction of change as Kendall Ï„ values. The GISTEMP data set has been obtained as version 5 from the GISS,

Both data sets have been downloaded on 31 January 2018. The four reanalysis data sets and their sources are the following:
