For four countries, data from the year 2015 were not available, in which case we chose the most recent year for which data were available: Eritrea (2011), Libya (2011), Papua New Guinea (2014), and Venezuela (2013). To calculate changes in SD in individual countries (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>), we interpolated the multimodel average of the relative annual SD changes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1C</xref>) to a global grid of 0.1 Ã— 0.1 degrees using a bilinear interpolation. We then picked all grid cells in a particular country and calculated the area average. The country boundaries for creating the selection mask have been obtained from
