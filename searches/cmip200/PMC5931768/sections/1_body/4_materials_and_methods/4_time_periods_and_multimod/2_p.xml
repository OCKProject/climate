<p class="p">When calculating seasonal changes, we only selected the anomalies from the specific months belonging to a season (hence removing all other months from the time series). For each model, season, and time period, we then calculated the SD of the anomaly time series for the variable under consideration and took the absolute and relative difference between the two periods for each season and model. Because the historical simulation from 1850â€“2005 includes the radiative forcing from volcanic eruptions (in particular the strong eruption of Mt. Krakatoa in 1883), whereas the future scenario does not, we verified the robustness of our results. For example, when using a base period from 1888 to 1917 (that is, excluding the Krakatoa eruption) or the preindustrial control simulations (which do not contain volcanic eruptions), our results remain essentially the same.</p>
