<p class="p">Thereafter, we averaged the resulting maps over all models. To do so, we brought the data on the same grid by interpolating each map to the grid of the model with the highest resolution (CCSM4), using a bilinear interpolation (CMCC-CM has even higher resolution but not all variables that we analyzed were available in that model, see above). The same method and grid were also used for interpolating the four reanalysis data sets. All multimodel averages are based on the same time period in each model.</p>
