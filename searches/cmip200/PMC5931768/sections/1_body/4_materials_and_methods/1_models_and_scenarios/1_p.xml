<p class="p">We analyzed all 37 models for which surface air temperature was available from the historical and RCP8.5 simulations: ACCESS1-0, ACCESS1-3, bcc-csm1-1, bcc-csm1-1-m, BNU-ESM, CanESM2, CCSM4, CESM1-BGC, CESM1-CAM5, CMCC-CESM, CMCC-CM, CMCC-CMS, CNRM-CM5, CSIRO-Mk3-6-0, FGOALS-g2, GFDL-CM3, GFDL-ESM2G, GFDL-ESM2M, FIO-ESM, EC-EARTH, GISS-E2-H, GISS-E2-R, HadGEM2-AO, HadGEM2-CC, HadGEM2-ES, inmcm4, IPSL-CM5A-LR, IPSL-CM5A-MR, IPSL-CM5B-LR, MIROC5, MIROC-ESM, MIROC-ESM-CHEM, MPI-ESM-LR, MPI-ESM-MR, MRI-CGCM3, NorESM1-M, and NorESM1-ME. The historical simulation starts in the year 1850, with the exception of the three versions of HadGEM2, where it starts in 1860. The RCP8.5 simulation ends in 2100 and has been extended to 2300 in the models bcc-csm1-1, CCSM4, CNRM-CM5, CSIRO-Mk3-6-0, GISS-E2-G, GISS-E2-H, IPSL-CM5A-LR, and MPI-ESM-LR, and to 2299 in HadGEM2-ES. For GFDL-ESM2M, years 2101 to 2200 were also available but were not used for our analysis.</p>
