<p class="p">We used the monthly mean surface air temperature and removed the annual cycle at each grid cell within a running window of 30 years length, centered at the time point under consideration (fig. S8A). Choosing a baseline in such a local time window and considering each month separately are crucial to our analysis because it circumvents two problems: (i) the typical annual cycle changes over time (

  <italic class="italic">53</italic>
 </xref>, 
 <xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">54</italic>
 </xref>), for example, because the minimum and maximum sea-ice area occurs later in the year in a warmer world (
 <xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">54</italic>
 </xref>), and (ii) the choice of any specific reference period would lead to biases due to the limited sample size (
 <xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">47</italic>
 </xref>). Within the window and for each month, we subtracted the mean value of all 30 temperature values to obtain a temperature anomaly. Because of the necessity of 15 years of data to both sides of a data point, the procedure shortens each time series by 30 years.
