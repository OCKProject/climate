<p class="p">For comparing trends in models and observations in the period 1958–2017, we used the same procedure but with a sliding window size of 15 years to remove the annual cycle, and 20 years to calculate the SD of the residuals. We took 1958 as the start year because we expected the anthropogenic fingerprint to be small before the mid–20th century and because only few observations are available from earlier years.</p>
