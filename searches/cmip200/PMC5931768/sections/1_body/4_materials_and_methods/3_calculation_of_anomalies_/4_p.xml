<p class="p">For comparing models and reanalysis data sets in the time period 1980–2010, we used a slightly different procedure: Instead of using a running window, we removed a linear trend from each month’s yearly time series. This linear trend removal is adequate because of the short time period and has the advantage that no data points are lost in the beginning and end of the time series. As we removed trends for each month separately, we still took into account that the typical annual cycle can change within the time period.</p>
