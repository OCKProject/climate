<p class="p">Thereafter, we calculated the SD within a sliding window of 100 years that we moved along each anomaly time series at each grid cell in each model (fig. S8B). Hence, the window covers almost half the length of the whole time series like in previous studies (

 </xref>). We calculated the trend in the obtained SD values based on the Kendal τ rank correlation coefficient (fig. S8C). A positive Kendal τ signals increasing SD, whereas a negative τ indicates decreasing SD. For example, a monotonous increase over time would yield τ = 1, whereas a monotonous decrease would yield τ = −1, and no trend would yield τ = 0. The Kendall τ values were used to assess the model agreement in fig. S1 and the hatching in
