   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref> (C and F). Negative values indicate that changes are driven by soil drying, whereas positive values indicate a larger contribution of atmospheric variability. Ice sheets and locations where changes in temperature SD are smaller than 0.1K have been masked out (white areas). Each hemisphere shows summer conditions (JJA in the North, DJF in the South). All changes are calculated from the multimodel average and the period 1875–1904 versus 2055–2084.
