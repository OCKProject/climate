  <p class="p">Distributions of changes in run-off for low flows (flows for lowest 10% of time) simulated by the JULES ecosystem–hydrology model under the ensemble of six climate projections at 1.5°C (blue) and 2°C (orange) global warming. Boxes show the 25th and 75th percentile changes, whiskers show the range, circles show the four projections that do not define the ends of the range, and crosses show the ensemble means. Numbers in square brackets show the ensemble-mean flow in the baseline, in millimetres of rain equivalent. </p>
