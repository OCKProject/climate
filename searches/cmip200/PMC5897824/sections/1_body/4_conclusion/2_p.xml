<p class="p">The higher-resolution HadGEM3 simulations project consistent increases in temperature-related extremes, with larger changes at 2°C compared to 1.5°C and local changes being larger than the global annual mean. There is a higher degree of spatial variation in our projections compared with CMIP5-based studies.</p>
