<p class="p">Broadly, changes in weather extremes at 1.5°C global warming could be estimated by scaling-back the impacts at 2°C, if this is done with individual ensemble members rather than the ensemble mean. However, this was not always the case for impacts that depend on more complex process or interactions between more than one climate variable, such as run-off and an indicator of vulnerability to food insecurity.</p>
