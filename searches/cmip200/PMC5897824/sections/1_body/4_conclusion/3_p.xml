<p class="p">In the model projections examined here, changes relating to the water cycle are complex, both in their geographical pattern and in the variation between different models. The length of flooding events generally increases across world in all models, but maximum rainfall can either increase or decrease depending on locations. Global patterns of increase and decrease show some consistency between the different GWLs, but also some local differences. Worldwide, most impacts broadly tend to increase with global warming in most areas. For global mean changes, even when the sign of change is uncertain, individual realizations generally show reduced impact at 1.5°C compared with 2°C. However, this does not always hold even at the scale of major global river basins.</p>
