<p class="p">Most simulations here project a general increase in mean streamflow in most of the basins examined, but with a number of notable exceptions in the tropics. While flows in the Ganges are consistently projected to increase by 30–110% at 2°C, Amazon flows could either increase by 3% or decrease by 25%. Ensemble-mean changes in river flow often do not give a full impression of the magnitude of changes that may be possible, so adaptation planning in particular should not rely on ensemble-mean projections and instead consider a range of outcomes. The seasonal low streamflows also increase in many basins, but not as many as for the mean flows—many basins see decreased low flows in some or all projections.</p>
