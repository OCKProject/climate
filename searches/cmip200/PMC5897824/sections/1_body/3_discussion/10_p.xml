<p class="p">The spatial pattern of changes in the different ensemble members may also play a role in influencing the global mean changes, for example, with large changes in some regions due to faster snow-melt or changes in cloud cover in one ensemble member leading to particular changes in regional warming that are not seen in other ensemble members. Moreover, the individual forcings of the different aerosol components such as sulfate and black carbon differ in sign and spatial pattern, so the overall impact on local radiative forcing and hence regional temperature patterns is more complex. Therefore, the global mean changes may not necessarily be expected to relative to global mean forcings.</p>
