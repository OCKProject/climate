<p class="p">A further complexity in identifying precise mechanisms for regional changes is the experimental design used here, with one atmospheric model and concentration/emissions scenario but six different SST and SIC patterns, means that the impact of spatial heterogeneity in radiative forcings is complex and involves a mix of effects in HadGEM3 and the original CMIP5 models. In the case of aerosols, for example, our HadGEM3 simulations are driven with RCP8.5 aerosol emissions and the aerosol concentrations are then calculated within the model itself. The spatial distributions of aerosol optical depth and radiative forcing can, therefore, be expected to be reasonably similar, because they arise from the same emissions scenario, although some differences may occur due to the different regional climate-change patterns. However, the impact of aerosols is also seen in the SST and SIC changes, because these will have responded to changes in regional aerosol radiative forcing in the original CMIP5 simulations. Therefore, these SST and SIC patterns will carry the ‘memory’ of aerosol changes in the original CMIP5 projections.</p>
