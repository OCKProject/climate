<p class="p">The largest regional differences between 2째C and 1.5째C global warming tend to be in the regions where the local impact is largest relative to the baseline. For TXx this is generally the mid-latitudes, whereas for TX90p it is generally the tropics. So, broadly, the impacts at 1.5째C global warming could be estimated by scaling-back the impacts at 2째C.</p>
