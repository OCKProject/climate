<p class="p">These results show some similarities with those from the CMIP5 models [

 <xref rid="RSTA20160452C38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>], but also some notable differences. The CMIP5 models were at lower spatial resolution than the models used here. Although the general patterns of change in TXx are broadly similar in our study and CMIP5, with greater warming in many continental interiors, is notable that our results show more marked geographical variation than those from CMIP5 projections ([
 <xref rid="RSTA20160452C9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>], among others), with the continental interior warming being more intense in our projections. In particular, our results with HadGEM3 show more intense increases in maximum temperature in North America and Europe.
