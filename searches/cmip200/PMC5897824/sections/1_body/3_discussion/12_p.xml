<p class="p">One example of an impact of changing aerosol radiative forcing could be the precipitation changes in northern South America including Amazonia. All ensemble members show a general drying in this region, as seen in RX5day and mean run-off results. The reduction in Rx5day is particularly notable, because the general expectation would be for an increase in heavy rainfall events in a warmer climate, as is seen in most other regions in these projections. This reduced rainfall in the Amazon region may be associated with the reducing net negative aerosol radiative forcing in the North Atlantic [
