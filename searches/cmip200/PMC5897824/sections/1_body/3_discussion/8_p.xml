<p class="p">One key factor is the different times of passing a particular GWL, because the net radiative forcing would be different even though the same emissions and concentration scenario was used in all simulations. A given GWL was reached at a different time in each ensemble member, so the CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and aerosol concentrations vary between ensemble members; in members reaching a GWL early, such as that driven by IPSL-CM5A-LR, the CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration is relatively lower than in other members, and the total aerosol concentration would be relatively higher (CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentrations are projected to increase in RCP8.5, but aerosol concentrations are projected decline). The net radiative forcing is smaller, because in RCP8.5 the increase positive radiative forcing from CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> is greater than the decrease in net negative radiative forcing from aerosols. Moreover, the physiological effect of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> is also smaller, meaning that the consequent reduction in transpiration and associated additional land surface warming influence would also be expected to be smaller.
