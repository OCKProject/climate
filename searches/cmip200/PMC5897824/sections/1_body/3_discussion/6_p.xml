<p class="p">The decrease in Rx5day in some regions in our simulations contrasts with the subset of CMIP5 models used for the ISIMIP Fast-Track projections [
 <xref rid="RSTA20160452C9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>] which suggested an increase in Rx5day almost everywhere where at least 66% of the model ensemble agreed on the sign of the change, including all of northern South America. The reasons for these differences require further investigation, but some insight into possible reasons may be gained by examining the similarities and differences between our own individual ensemble members.
