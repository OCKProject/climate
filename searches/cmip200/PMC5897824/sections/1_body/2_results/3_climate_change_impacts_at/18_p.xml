<p class="p">The simulated changes in both mean and low run-off flows show substantial differences among the six simulations (figures

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTA20160452F11" class="xref">11</xref>). In most basins examined here, the range of outcomes include both increases and decreases in mean and low flows for any particular basin, but generally with the largest proportion simulating increases in both mean and low flows. In a few cases, notably the Lena in northeast Asia and Ganges in southeast Asia, the ensemble agreed entirely or almost entirely on increased flows. Even here, the range of outcomes is large, with the projected flow increases in the Ganges for 2Â°C global warming ranging from approximately 30% to more than 110%.
