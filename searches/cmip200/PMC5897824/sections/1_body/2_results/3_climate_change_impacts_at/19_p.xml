<p class="p">Exceptions to the general picture of consensus on increasing flows are seen in the Amazon, Orange, Danube and Guadiana basins where the range of projected extends more towards decreased mean flows. Mean flows in the Amazon are projected to decline by up to 25% for 2°C global warming. For low flows, the ensemble of projections entirely gives decreased flows at 2°C global warming for these basins.</p>
