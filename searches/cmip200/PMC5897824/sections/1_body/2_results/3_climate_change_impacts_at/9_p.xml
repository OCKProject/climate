<p class="p">The average length of flood events (number of days in which the cumulative daily rainfall excess is positive, compared to the 95th percentile of the baseline) generally increase over most of the land surface, although this increase was mostly by a day or less (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTA20160452F6" class="xref">figure 6</xref>). However, some areas are projected to see an increase in flood event lengths of 4 days or more, particularly India and Bangladesh, for which such increases are projected in all ensemble members to some extent. Increases of 2â€“4 days are also projected in parts of Brazil by all ensemble members, although the magnitude and location within the country varied between members. Similar increases are projected in the region of the Horn of Africa and southern Arabian Peninsula in several members.
