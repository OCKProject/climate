<p class="p">The number of consecutive dry days is projected to increase over some regions and decrease in others (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTA20160452F4" class="xref">figure 4</xref>). Southern Africa, the Mediterranean, Australia and northeast South America are projected to have increased dry spell lengths, while this is projected to decrease in central and eastern Asia. The general pattern of these projections is broadly consistent across the ensemble members. However, the global mean changes vary in sign (
 <xref rid="RSTA20160452TB5" ref-type="table" class="xref">table 5</xref>), as a result of different magnitudes of regional changes dominating in different ensemble members.
