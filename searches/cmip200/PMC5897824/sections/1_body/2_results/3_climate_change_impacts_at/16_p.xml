<p class="p">The JULES simulations show a general tendency towards increased run-off over approximately half of the land surface (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTA20160452F9" class="xref">figure 9</xref>) and the majority of the major river basins assessed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTA20160452F10" class="xref">figure 10</xref>), but with large regional uncertainties including the possibility of decreased flows in many basins. The ensemble-mean change in mean streamflow shows an increase of between 5 and 25% over most of the Northern Hemisphere land surface, with some regions seeing an increase of over 50% at 2Â°C global warming. Notable exceptions to this are western Europe and southcentral USA, which see less than a 5% change in run-off, and the already very dry region of the Sahara Desert where the existing very small run-off become even smaller.
