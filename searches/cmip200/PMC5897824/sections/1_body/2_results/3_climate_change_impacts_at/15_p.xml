<p class="p">Four countries show ensemble-mean HCVI values at 2°C global warming that are higher than any seen in the baseline climate; these are Oman, Bangladesh, Mauritania and Yemen. The implication of such HCVI values is that climate change at 2°C is projected to cause levels of vulnerability to food insecurity that are greater than any seen in the present day. For individual ensemble members, the number of countries with ‘unprecedented’ HCVI values at 2°C varies from three to seven. Conversely, many countries in the baseline climate have levels of vulnerability to food insecurity that are greater than those expected in other countries under 2°C global warming. This suggests that other factors are already posing greater risk for food insecurity than 2°C climate change is expected to cause in other countries, so the increased risk from climate change should not overshadow the need to reduce vulnerability to food insecurity arising from non-climatic factors. There is scope to reduce vulnerability to food insecurity by addressing various socio-economic issues in such counties.</p>
