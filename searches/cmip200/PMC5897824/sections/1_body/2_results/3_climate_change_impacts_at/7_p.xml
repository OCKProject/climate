<p class="p">Perhaps more surprisingly, projected changes in maximum 5 day rainfall (Rx5day) also vary in sign both geographically and between models (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTA20160452F5" class="xref">figure 5</xref>). Extreme rainfall might simplistically be expected to increase in a warmer climate, and indeed the global mean change is a consistent increase in all ensemble members (
 <xref rid="RSTA20160452TB5" ref-type="table" class="xref">table 5</xref>). Regional Rx5day is projected to increase over many regions including parts of southeast Asia, southern South America, northern Australia and the east coast of the USA. However, some regions (particularly, the central Amazon and the northern coast of South America) are projected to see a decrease in Rx5day.
