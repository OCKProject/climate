<p class="p">Ensemble-mean projected changes in low run-off flows are generally larger (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTA20160452F11" class="xref">figure 11</xref>), with the regions seeing an increase in mean run-off seeing a larger percentage increase in low run-offâ€”over 75% increases over much of North America, Eastern Europe and Asia. Note that this does not necessarily imply a larger increase in absolute low flow compared to absolute mean flow, because the baseline is (by definition) smaller for low flows. In western Europe, where the changes in mean flows were less than 5%, the ensemble-mean low flow decreases by between 5 and 75%, especially in the Iberian Peninsula. Southern Africa also sees a decrease in low flows where changes in mean flows were small. Changes in high run-off show similar patterns and magnitudes to those in mean run-off.
