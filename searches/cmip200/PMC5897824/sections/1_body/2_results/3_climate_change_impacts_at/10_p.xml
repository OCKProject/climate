<p class="p">The HCVI calculated for 2°C global warming showed very large geographical variability (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTA20160452F7" class="xref">figure 7</xref>) which relates largely to differences in socio-economic factors [
 <xref rid="RSTA20160452C22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Differences in the climate change simulated in different ensemble members leads to some variation in the HCVI at 2°C, although the geographical variation is still dominated by the non-climatic factors (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTA20160452F7" class="xref">figure 7</xref>). Therefore, the ensemble-mean change is a reasonable guide to the results.
