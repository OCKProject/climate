<p class="p">For 2°C global warming, the ensemble-mean increase in annual daily maximum temperature was above 2°C for most of the land surface, with the exception of the Indian subcontinent, most of Australia and Antarctica (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTA20160452F2" class="xref">figure 2</xref>). The increase was higher still in many regions; most of North America, much of China and north Asia, northwestern South America and all of Europe. In the northern and eastern USA and much of northern and western Europe, the annual daily maximum temperature increased by over 4°C for 2°C global warming. The global mean TXx increased by more than 2°C in all ensemble members (
 <xref rid="RSTA20160452TB5" ref-type="table" class="xref">table 5</xref>), so the maximum temperature warming more than the global annual mean is a consistent result across all projections here, as found in previous studies with other models [
