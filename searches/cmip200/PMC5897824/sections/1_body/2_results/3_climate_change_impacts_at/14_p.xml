<p class="p">Brazil is projected to see increased HCVI, but for reasons which vary between ensemble members. Although the location of projected longer flood events varies across the country in different members, the aggregation of the HCVI to the country level renders this geographical variability irrelevant for such a large country because only the median value across the country is used in the HCVI. Some ensemble members project longer drought for Brazil, which again contributed to increased HCVI.</p>
