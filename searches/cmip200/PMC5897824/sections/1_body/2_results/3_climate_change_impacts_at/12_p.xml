<p class="p">The ensemble members showed broadly consistent changes in HCVI at 2Â°C global warming, with increases in most assessed countries and generally similar sets of countries experiencing the largest and smallest changes. Southeastern Africa consistently showed larger increases in HCVI than Central Africa, due to increased length of drought events projected in all ensemble members (not shown). The length of flood events was not projected to increase in this region. The Sahel region consistently showed one or more countries with a small decrease in the HCVI, although the precise country or countries varied between ensemble members. The decrease in HCVI here was due to projected decreases in length of drought, with length of flood events projected to change little.</p>
