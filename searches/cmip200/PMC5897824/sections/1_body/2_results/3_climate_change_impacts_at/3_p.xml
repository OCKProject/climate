<p class="p">The different ensemble members give somewhat different results at regional scales, although there is a strong consensus on the temperature extremes examined here becoming warmer. In the simulations driven by SSTs and SICs from the two IPSL CMIP5 models, most of the global land surface sees an increase in annual daily maximum temperature which is similar to the global annual mean temperature increase. In the IPSL-driven simulations, increases in TXx substantially larger than the GWL are confined to the eastern USA, Europe and part of northeast Asia. By contrast, the GFDL-driven simulation shows much of the global land surface seeing increases in annual daily maximum temperature larger than the global mean warming. Much of the mid-latitudes experience an increase in TXx of over 4°C. The very largest increases of 5°C or more are seen in central North America, Europe and northwestern Asia. Similar results are seen in the MIROC and ACCESS models.</p>
