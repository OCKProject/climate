<p class="p">For a world at 2°C global warming, we present a range of outcomes to provide insight into the level of agreement between models for a particular projected change, and hence an indication of potential robustness of the projected changes for informing adaptation. We then make a comparison of impacts at global warming 1.5°C to investigate the level of impact that would be avoided by limiting global warming to different levels. Bearing in mind the uncertainty in regional climate outcomes, we address this in a number of ways. For individual realizations, we compare the impacts at different warming levels to see if they are systematically smaller at 1.5°C, even if the sign of the change is uncertain. We also compare the range of outcomes at different GWLs, to see if the regional-scale uncertainty itself increases with global warming.</p>
