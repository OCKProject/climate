<p class="p">As noted above, four countries saw ensemble-mean HCVI values at 2°C above any seen in the baseline, and this number increased to seven at 1.5°C. The same four countries with ‘unprecedented’ HCVI values at 2°C also saw ‘unprecedented’ values at 1.5°C; these were Oman, Bangladesh, Mauritania and Yemen. These were joined by Myanmar, India and Cambodia as having ‘unprecedented’ values at 1.5°C. The role of internal climate variability in the HCVI results needs to be assessed, as does the effect of potential nonlinear interactions between the flood and drought metric. Until the reasons behind these country-specific results are understood, this comparison of the number of ‘unprecedented’ HCVI values at 1.5°C and 2°C should be treated with caution. Nevertheless, the finding that some countries see HCVI values higher at either or both 1.5°C and 2°C compared to the baseline may indicate that climate change has the potential to lead to unprecedented levels of vulnerability to food insecurity in some countries. More robustly, it can be concluded that by this metric, overall worldwide vulnerability to food insecurity generally increases with global warming, and for approximately three-quarters of countries assessed, this increase is larger at 2°C than 1.5°C.</p>
