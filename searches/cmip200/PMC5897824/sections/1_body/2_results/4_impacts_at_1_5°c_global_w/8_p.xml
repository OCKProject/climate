<p class="p">Of the 122 countries assessed, 93 have smaller ensemble-mean HCVI calculated at 1.5°C global warming than at 2°C, indicating an ensemble consensus that 76% of assessed countries would see a smaller increase in vulnerability to food insecurity if global warming were limited to 1.5°C (figures

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTA20160452F19" class="xref">19</xref>). Conversely, 24% of countries would, by this metric, see the same or higher vulnerability to food insecurity at 1.5°C than 2°C. Of these, some are countries where HCVI is projected to be lower at 2°C global warming than in the baseline. For example, in Mali the ensemble-mean baseline HCVI of 0.83 increased slightly to 0.85 at 1.5°C then reduced to 0.81 at 2°C. In some countries, the ensemble-mean HCVI happened to be identical at both warming levels. In Chad, for example, the baseline HCVI of 0.89 increased to 0.91 at both 1.5°C and 2°C.
