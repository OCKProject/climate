<p class="p">For almost all quantities and simulations examined here, global-scale changes in extremes and run-off at 1.5°C global warming (
 <xref rid="RSTA20160452TB6" ref-type="table" class="xref">table 6</xref>) are smaller than those compared to 2°C (
 <xref rid="RSTA20160452TB5" ref-type="table" class="xref">table 5</xref>; figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTA20160452F12" class="xref">12</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTA20160452F13" class="xref">13</xref>). The exceptions to these are mean and low run-off which each show one instance of a smaller change at 2°C than 1.5°C, but still with a majority of simulations showing larger changes at 2°C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTA20160452F13" class="xref">figure 13</xref>). For temperature-related indices, the ranges of change at the two GWLs do not overlap—the change at 2°C in all members is larger than the change at 1.5°C in all members (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTA20160452F12" class="xref">figure 12</xref>). This is not the case for the precipitation and run-off results; for those quantities, there is substantial overlap in the ranges of changes at 2°C and 1.5°C, so there is not a consistent picture of how much wetter or drier the world is projected to be in this ensemble, even though it involves a single atmosphere model.
