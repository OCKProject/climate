<p class="p">The range of projected mean run-off changes is larger for 2°C than 1.5°C in many basins, but this was not always the case, with many basins showing similar or smaller ranges at 2°C compared with 1.5°. Moreover, the ranges overlap substantially, so in terms of the set of possible outcomes projected here, the differences between 2°C and 1.5°C are not always clear. The differences between 2°C and 1.5°C are not always in the same direction as the changes at 2°C; in the Amazon, for example, the difference in flow between 2°C and 1.5°C varies from positive to negative between ensemble members.</p>
