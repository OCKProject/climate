<p class="p">For precipitation, generally similar changes are seen at 1.5°C global warming as at 2°C, but smaller in magnitude (compare figures

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTA20160452F4" class="xref">4</xref>), suggesting that most of these changes are a response to radiatively forced climate change as opposed to internal climate variability. However, some localized changes do vary in sign between the GWLs, such as in South Australia, suggesting a possible dominance of internal variability over the global warming signal in these places.
