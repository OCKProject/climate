<p class="p">The percentage of days exceeding the 90th percentile of daily temperature (Tx90p) also increases less at 1.5°C global warming than at 2°C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTA20160452F15" class="xref">figure 15</xref>). The largest reductions are in the tropics, where the largest increase was seen at 2°C; whereas at 2°C global warming, 50% or more days were projected to exceed the baseline 10th percentile, at 1.5°C this reduces by 15–20% or more. Again, the patterns of change at 1.5°C retain a similar geographical pattern of greater increases in the tropics than mid-latitudes (electronic supplementary material).
