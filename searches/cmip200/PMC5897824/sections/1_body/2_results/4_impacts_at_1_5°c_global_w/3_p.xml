<p class="p">For TXx, the difference between 2°C and 1.5°C global warming is larger than the 0.5°C difference in global mean temperature across most of the land surface in all ensemble members (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTA20160452F14" class="xref">figure 14</xref>). Although some ensemble members simulate local temperatures to be higher at 1.5°C global warming than 2°C in some small regions, these are relatively localized and most regions are cooler at 1.5°C global warming than 2°C. In many regions, the difference is between 0.5°C and 1.0°C, but many other regions see larger differences. In several ensemble members, the difference is 1.5°C, 2°C or larger in large parts of North America, South America, Europe and China. For example, over parts of Europe, where annual maximum daily temperature was projected to increase by over 5°C for a 2°C global warming, the local increase is limited to 3–4°C for 1.5°C global warming. Limiting global warming by half a degree Celsius would, therefore, limit maximum temperatures by three or four times as much in those areas (
