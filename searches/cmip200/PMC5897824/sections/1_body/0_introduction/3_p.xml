<p class="p">There are two major research questions concerning the impacts of climate change at 1.5°C and 2°C global warming, which are relevant to both mitigation and adaptation policy areas. 
 <list list-type="simple" class="list">
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">(i) How much larger are the impacts at 2°C compared to 1.5°C? This is the primary question arising from the Paris Agreement [
    <xref rid="RSTA20160452C4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>] and is relevant to mitigation policy, informing judgements and actions on holding the global temperature rise to ‘well below 2°C’ and ‘pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C’.
   </p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">(ii) What regional climate conditions and related hydrological and ecological conditions could occur at a particular level of global warming, such as 2°C? This is relevant to adaptation policy and planning—exploring the possible outcomes for these levels of warming will help facilitate adaptation and improved resilience to account for a 1.5°C or 2°C world. It is recognized that many adaptation decisions require information on timing of specific impacts or risks, but nevertheless, framing regional impacts assessments in terms of associated global warming levels (GWLs) may help provide context of the levels of climate change that may be avoidable or unavoidable (and hence require adaptation).</p>
