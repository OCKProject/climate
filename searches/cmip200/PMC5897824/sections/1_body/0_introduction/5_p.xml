<p class="p">Both questions require an appropriate assessment of uncertainty. There are considerable uncertainties in projections of regional climate change, with different climate models projecting regional climate changes that can differ in magnitude or even, in the case of precipitation and impacts quantities strongly related to this, differ in sign [

 <xref rid="RSTA20160452C6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. This may have important implications for regional impacts at specific levels of global warming. A common approach to exploring and presenting such uncertainties is to examine the ensemble mean and the level of consensus among the ensemble members on the sign of the change. While this can often be useful in informing an assessment of the level of confidence in future projections, it may not always be sufficient to fully inform decisions. Risk assessment approaches require consideration of a range of possible risks, not just the most likely. This paper explores a range of regional climate states and related impacts that occur at global warming of 2°C, and a range of differences with warming limited to 1.5°C.
