<p class="p">We examine the implications of our new climate projections by applying some commonly used indices of climate extremes, and a further index quantifying relative vulnerability to food insecurity which combines climate extremes indices with information on a range of factors representing sensitivity and adaptability of food systems to climate hazards. We also use the climate projections to drive a global land surface model to simulate changes in run-off as an indicator of freshwater availability. We assess whether regional extremes are projected to increase or decrease at 2째C global warming, and whether the consequent impact on drought and vulnerability to food insecurity become greater or smaller. We also assess whether these changes are reduced by limiting global warming to 1.5째C. We explore some of the uncertainties in these projections, and, in particular, examine whether the use of ensemble-mean projections is a useful simple guide to impacts projections or whether this can lead to a misleading impression for some impacts. Regarding vulnerability to food insecurity, we consider the impacts of global warming at 1.5째C and 2째C alongside socio-economic influences that affect the sensitivity to climate change. We also consider our climate-change impacts results in comparison with other studies using older, lower-resolution climate projections.</p>
