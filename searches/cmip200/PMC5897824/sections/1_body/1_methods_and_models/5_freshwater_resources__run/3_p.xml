<p class="p">It has been noted that hydrological impacts models driven by climate-change projections from climate models tend to give more severe drying than simulated in the climate models themselves [

 <xref rid="RSTA20160452C34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. This is largely attributed to the inclusion of plant stomatal closure in response to elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> in the climate model land surface schemes, which generally reduces evapotranspiration relative to climate projections without this process and hence further increases run-off/streamflow or ameliorates decreases [
 <xref rid="RSTA20160452C34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. This process is often omitted from standard hydrological models. Plant physiological responses to CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> are included in the JULES model, so our projections of changes in run-off here do account for this process.
