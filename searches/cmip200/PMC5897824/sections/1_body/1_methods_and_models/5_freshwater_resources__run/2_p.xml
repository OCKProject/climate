 <xref rid="RSTA20160452C25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>], a coupled ecosystem–hydrology–surface exchange model which simulates land-atmosphere fluxes of water, energy and carbon in an internally consistent way, typically applied at global scales. Variants of JULES form the land surface scheme of Met Office Hadley Centre Earth System Models [

 <xref rid="RSTA20160452C30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>] within such models. JULES can also be used outside of the Earth System Model (ESM), driven by meteorological outputs of other ESMs to assess impacts of a wider range of climate projections [
