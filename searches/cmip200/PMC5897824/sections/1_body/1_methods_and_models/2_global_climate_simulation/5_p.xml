 <xref rid="RSTA20160452C13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>] which was used for CMIP5. Key improvements over the previous model, HadGEM2, include increased vertical levels in the atmosphere (85 compared to 38) and substantial changes to the model dynamics (ENDGame) [
 <xref rid="RSTA20160452C17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. This version of the HadGEM3 model lies in the transition from CMIP5 to CMIP6 versions. The Met Office is currently operationally running the coupled HadGEM3-GC2 model at N216 resolution for seasonal and decadal forecasting and clear benefits are emerging from this use at higher resolution [
