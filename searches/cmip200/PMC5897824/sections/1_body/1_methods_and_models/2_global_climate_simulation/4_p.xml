<p class="p">HadGEM3 (Hadley Centre Global Environment Model version 3) is a configuration of the UK Met Office Unified Model (MetUM) which has been developed for use for both climate research and weather prediction applications. It is the result of converging the development of the Met Office's weather and climate global atmospheric model components so that, where possible, atmospheric processes are modelled or parametrized seamlessly across spatial resolutions and timescales.</p>
