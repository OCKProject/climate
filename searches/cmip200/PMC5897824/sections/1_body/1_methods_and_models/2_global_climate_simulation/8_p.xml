<p class="p">Atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations were prescribed from the standard RCP8.5 concentration scenario. Aerosol concentrations were calculated within the model, with aerosol emissions prescribed again from the standard RCP8.5 scenario. This means that the greenhouse gas and aerosol concentrations, and hence radiative forcing, were the same in all ensemble members at any given date. Since specific levels of global warming such as 1.5°C or 2°C were reached at different times in the different ensemble members, according to the SST forcings used, any given level of global warming could be associated with different radiative forcings in different ensemble members. In any given ensemble member at any specific level of global warming, the CO
