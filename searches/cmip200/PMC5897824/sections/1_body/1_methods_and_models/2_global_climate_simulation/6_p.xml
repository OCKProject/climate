<p class="p">We ran the model using only its atmosphere and land components, with time-varying sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) and sea-ice concentrations (SICs) prescribed as input quantities. This approach was taken for two reasons: (i) to provide a rapid first analysis of the implications of the higher resolution for projections of climate extremes and impacts—an atmosphere-only simulation requires considerably less computing time than a coupled ocean–atmosphere general circulation model (GCM); (ii) to allow us to explore, to some degree, uncertainties in regional climate changes by using SSTs and SICs from different climate models. To explore these uncertainties in the regional impacts of climate change, we carried out six HadGEM3 atmospheric simulations driven by time-varying SSTs and SICs from a subset of projections from the CMIP5 with the RCP8.5 scenario. The assumption here is that SSTs and SICs provide a substantial influence on regional patterns of climate change over land, so using a range of SST and SIC patterns in a single atmosphere model goes some way towards representing the range of regional climate changes that would arise in a set of different coupled ocean–atmosphere GCMs. This approach will not capture the full range of uncertainty affecting regional climate changes over land, because it still relies on one atmosphere model and one land surface scheme, so responses to radiative forcing that depend mainly on atmospheric process or land-atmosphere interactions will still be constrained by the behaviour of that single model. Nevertheless, we consider that our experimental design avoids the reliance on one single realization of climate and hence allows some of the uncertainties in regional climate-change impacts to be illustrated and explored.</p>
