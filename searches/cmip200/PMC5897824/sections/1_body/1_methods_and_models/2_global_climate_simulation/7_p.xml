<p class="p">The SSTs and SICs were taken from a subset of the CMIP5 transient projections performed with the RCP8.5 scenario from 1979 to 2100—the CMIP5 members were selected as representative of a range of outcomes for future climate change, including high and low climate sensitivity, different biases in baseline precipitation climatology, and different global patterns of precipitation change. Specific levels of global warming such as 1.5°C or 2°C were defined on the basis of the global mean temperature in the original CMIP5 projections. The time of reaching a specific level of global warming, therefore, varied between ensemble members. The CMIP5 SSTs were not bias-corrected, which means that the results here may be sensitive to systematic errors arising from biases in the present-day SST patterns.</p>
