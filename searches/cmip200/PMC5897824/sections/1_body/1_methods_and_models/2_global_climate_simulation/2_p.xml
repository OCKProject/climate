<p class="p">There are a number of ways in which 1.5°C or 2°C global warming can be defined—one could be the long-term climate state following a stabilization of warming at that level, another could be the state over a shorter period around the time of first reaching that level. Here we choose the second definition, which is what is seen first and hence needs to be adapted to. There are also a number of methods with which such changes can be assessed [

 <xref rid="RSTA20160452C10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>] to assess global-scale impacts at these resolutions for the first time.
