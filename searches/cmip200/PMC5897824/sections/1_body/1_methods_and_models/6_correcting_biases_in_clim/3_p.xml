<p class="p">This difference in approach led to inconsistencies in the definitions of the dates of GWLs in the two parts of the study. In the extremes analysis using raw model output, the dates of passing GWLs were defined on the basis of the global mean temperatures in the driving CMIP5 models relative to those models' simulations of global mean temperature in 1870â€“1899 (

However, in the HCVI and JULES analyses which used bias-corrected data, it was considered more appropriate for the GWLs to be defined using the warming in the observational dataset up to present-day plus model-projected warming thereafter (
 <xref rid="RSTA20160452TB4" ref-type="table" class="xref">table 4</xref>). While this does lead to inconsistent definitions of dates of the GWLs for applications of the climate model output with and without bias correction, the focus here is on the level of warming relative to pre-industrial rather than the timing of this warming. Therefore, priority is given to an accurate quantification of GWLs in all parts of the study, at the expense of inconsistencies in the dates of these warming levels. The inconsistency between the dates of the GWLs ranged from 2 to 9 years depending on the model and warming level. This inconsistency would have consequences if these results were applied to time-dependent impacts and adaptation assessments, but that is not the case here so this concern does not apply. However, one issue is that the time-dependent nature of the aerosol forcing means that the spatial pattern of regional climate responses varies over time, so this will lead to some degree of inconsistency between the analysis of the ClimPACT extremes and the HCVI and JULES impacts projections.
