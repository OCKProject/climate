<p class="p">The ClimPACT extreme weather indices, HCVI and JULES run-off simulations were all performed using outputs from the higher-resolution HadGEM3 projections described in §2a. However, there were some differences in how these data were applied, with different approaches to the treatment of systematic biases in the climate model output. For the ClimPACT analysis, it was considered important to assess changes in the raw climate model output, because this directly represents the behaviour of the model itself. The main focus was on the changes relative to the present-day baseline climate, defined as 1981–2010, with absolute values in either the baseline or the GWLs of 1.5°C and 2°C being only of secondary interest. For the HCVI and JULES run-off analyses, however, it was considered important to correct for systematic biases in the climate model output, because these can lead to unrealistic representations of the key quantities in the present-day simulation [
