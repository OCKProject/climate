 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTA20160452F1" class="xref">figure 1</xref>. The spatial pattern is compatible with HCVI values calculated using reanalysis data at the CMIP5 grid-scale resolution [
 <xref rid="RSTA20160452C23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]; the most vulnerable regions are sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. This higher-resolution climate data enables inclusion of additional countries which were not resolved in the lower-resolution CMIP5 data.
