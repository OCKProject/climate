<p class="p">To assess implications of climate change for vulnerability to food insecurity, we used an adaptation of the Hunger and Climate Vulnerability Index (HCVI) [
 <xref rid="RSTA20160452C22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. The HCVI was developed by the United Nations World Food Programme to provide a country-level assessment of vulnerability to food insecurity as a result of climate-related events. We used a new iteration of the HCVI which makes use of gridded climate model projections to understand the impact of climate change on vulnerability to food insecurity, and the benefits that adaptation can bring via scenarios of adaptation investment [
 <xref rid="RSTA20160452C23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. This iteration of the HCVI only considers in-country production of food and does not account for food trade. For this reason, the HCVI is only calculated for 122 developing and least-developed countries (defined here as countries not in the OECD or EU which can be resolved by the scale of the climate model; i.e. larger than 500â€‰km
