<p class="p">The HCVI consists of three equally weighted components: exposure to climate-related hazards, sensitivity of national agricultural production to climate-related hazards, and adaptive capacityâ€”a measure of a country's ability to cope with climate-related food shocks. The sensitivity and adaptive capacity components are based on data from the World Bank, World Resources Institute, UN Food and Agriculture Organization, UN Development Programme and UN Population Fund [
 <xref rid="RSTA20160452C22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. The exposure component comprised proxies for the average length of flood and drought events calculated with daily precipitation data [
 <xref rid="RSTA20160452C23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>] (
 <xref rid="RSTA20160452TB2" ref-type="table" class="xref">table 2</xref>). These proxies were chosen above other possible metrics as they were required to replace self-reported instances of flood and drought events used in the original HCVI, which correlate with undernutrition data at the country-level [
 <xref rid="RSTA20160452C23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. The proxies were therefore masked to only include data where a significant proportion of people live and grow crops before aggregating to country level and combining to comprise a measure of exposure [
 <xref rid="RSTA20160452C23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]; nevertheless, it is recognized that precipitation data alone may not always be adequate for representing flood and drought events, so the current method is regarded as preliminary.
