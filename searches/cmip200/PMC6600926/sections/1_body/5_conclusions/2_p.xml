<p class="p">By providing estimates of global biomass changes and associated uncertainties, our ensemble projections represent the most comprehensive outlook on the future of marine animal biomass to date. Our results are robust in terms of the direction of change, yet the substantial spread in the magnitude of projections illustrates considerable uncertainty in both ESMs and MEMs. The challenge is to address these uncertainties and improve our ability to predict marine ecosystem responses to climate change at different temporal and spatial scales. Projections based on global models are often less certain for coastal and polar regions but may be improved through regional downscaling to incorporate higher-resolution climate and ecosystem features (

 <xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>). The next round of CMIP6 projections with improved representation of biochemical parameters may also advance future ensemble projections (
 <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>). The expansion of global observational datasets provides further opportunities to better constrain and validate models. The incorporation of additional MEMs based on novel paradigms or reflecting alternative structures and processes may also be informative (
 <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>), along with regional ecosystem or fish stock models that more accurately capture processes at management-relevant scales (
 <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>). Future MEMs could also further explore how species interactions and potential acclimatization or adaptation of marine organisms modify projected distribution and abundance.
