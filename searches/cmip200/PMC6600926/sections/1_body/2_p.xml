<p class="p">Here we assess projected changes in global marine animal biomass over the 21st century through ensemble projections with six published global MEMs from Fish-MIP, forced with standardized outputs from two contrasting Earth system models (ESMs) and four emission scenarios [Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs)]. The MEMs range from size-structured [Bioeconomic Marine Trophic Size-spectrum (BOATS), Macroecological] and trait-based [Dynamic Pelagic Benthic Model (DPBM), Apex Predators EcoSystem Model (APECOSM)] to species distribution [Dynamic Bioclimate Envelope Model (DBEM)] and trophodynamic models (EcoOcean) (

The ESMs span the range of available Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) projections, from low [Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Climate Model (GFDL-ESM2M)] to high Institute Pierre Simon Laplace Climate Model (IPSL-CM5A-LR) increases in sea surface temperature (SST) and associated changes in net primary production (NPP), while other drivers were more similar (ref.

All climate change scenarios were run for historical (1970–2005) and future (2006–2100) periods without fishing to isolate the climate signal, and with fishing to evaluate how climate responses differ in an ocean fished at current levels of intensity (

Since not all MEMs could run the full set of scenarios, due to MEM or ESM limitations, we analyzed all available runs for each scenario, and performed sensitivity analyses on subsets, which revealed similar results (
