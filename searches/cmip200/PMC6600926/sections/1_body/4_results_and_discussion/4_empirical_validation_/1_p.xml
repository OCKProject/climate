<p class="p">All MEMs included in this study have been individually tested across a range of physical and biogeochemical variables, and outputs have been compared with empirical data across multiple temporal and spatial scales (

 <xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>). First, we extracted results of a recent analysis (

 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 10 MEM−ESM combinations), and correlations suggest a good fit for the ensemble mean (

 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.44), which was higher than for most individual models (0.13 ≤ 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> ≤ 0.47), reflecting the strength of the ensemble approach. We also compared biomass projections with fishing (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 6 MEM−ESMs) to average biomass relative to biomass at MSY (B/B

 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.96) than individual models (0.80 ≤ 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> ≤ 0.94). These analyses suggest that our ensemble projections reflect observed trends for assessed fish stocks, providing confidence in our historical and future projections.
