<p class="p">Although we did not find major differences in biomass changes among our three size groups (

 </xref>), the combined biomass of higher trophic levels from our MEMs declined more strongly than that of lower trophic levels from ESMs across all RCP scenarios (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>). This trophic amplification of biomass declines has been previously shown for phytoplankton and zooplankton across a range of ESMs (
 <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>), and our results suggest this effect may extend to higher food web levels. Such amplification of the climate signal from primary producers to higher trophic levels arises from multiple factors that vary among ESMs and MEMs, including changes in phytoplankton size composition, lengthening of food chains, reduced trophic efficiencies, and higher metabolic costs with increased body size (
 <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>). In addition to larger mean biomass declines, we also observed larger variability for higher trophic levels, particularly at higher RCPs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>). Mean NPP, phytoplankton, and zooplankton declines and variability from our two ESMs were comparable to those of other ESM ensembles (

 </ext-link>), and cannot resolve all underlying food web mechanisms. Nevertheless, the consistency of the response across diverse ESMs and MEMs does suggest a general pattern of higher trophic levels being more likely to show larger biomass declines than lower trophic levels. This raises concerns about wider impacts of climate change on the structure, function, and stability of ocean ecosystems (

 <xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>), especially in combination with other human stressors, such as fishing, that disproportionally affect higher trophic levels, a process called trophic downgrading (
