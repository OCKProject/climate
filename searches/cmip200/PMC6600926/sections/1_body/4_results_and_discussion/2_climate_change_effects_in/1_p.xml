<p class="p">Three MEMs were also able to run simulations with fishing, including time-varying historical and constant future fishing pressure (

 <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>) which may indirectly enhance prey biomass and weaken the relative climate change effect (
 <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>). This is a relatively small effect, however, compared with the large direct effect of fishing itself, which resulted in 16 to 80% lower biomass for animals of &gt;10 cm and 48 to 92% for animals of &gt;30 cm compared with unfished conditions in 2100 under RCP2.6, and slightly lower values under RCP8.5. We note that the absolute magnitude of the fishing effect is not directly comparable across MEMs, due to inherent differences in how fishing pressure and commercial versus noncommercial taxa are incorporated (
