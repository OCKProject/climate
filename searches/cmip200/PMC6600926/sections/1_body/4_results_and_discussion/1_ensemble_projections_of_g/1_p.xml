<p class="p">Our ensemble projections revealed consistent declines in global marine animal biomass from 1970 to 2100 across all emission scenarios (RCPs,

 </ext-link>), although the magnitude of decline varied among models. This general trend can be explained by warming causing increased ocean stratification, which reduces nutrient availability in the upper ocean, leading to decreased primary production and lower energy supply for higher trophic levels (

 </xref>). All four emission scenarios projected similar declines by 2030, the target year of many SDGs, and through to midcentury, after which they began to diverge. Projected mean biomass declines were similar for animals of &gt;10 cm and &gt;30 cm (
