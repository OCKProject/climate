<p class="p">The variability among MEMs can be attributed to differences in fundamental structures, taxonomic groups, and ecological processes. Generally, some MEMs respond strongly to temperature changes affecting metabolic rates (BOATS, Macroecological), while others are strongly driven by NPP changes affecting trophic dynamics (EcoOcean), or a combination of temperature, NPP, and additional drivers (e.g., pH, oxygen, ice cover) affecting habitat niches and species distribution (DBEM) or food web dynamics (DPBM, APECOSM) (

Some MEMs also allow for adaptive responses of species or communities to changing environments (e.g., size-structured and species distribution models), while others do not. Notably, the variability of projected changes among both MEMs and ESMs was higher under RCP8.5 than RCP2.6 (
