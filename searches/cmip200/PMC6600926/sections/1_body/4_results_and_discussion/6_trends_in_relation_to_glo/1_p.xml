 <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>), but these simple relationships represent well-founded approximations for a global average response. Recent results hindcasting temperature effects on biomass of 235 assessed fish stocks found a 4.1% drop in MSY from 1930 to 2010, a period that saw an average 0.6 °C of warming (
 <xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>). This reconstructed rate of change is consistent with our 5% drop in biomass per 1 °C of warming throughout the 21st century. According to these results, limiting future warming to 1.5 °C to 2.0 °C above preindustrial levels would limit biomass declines to 4 to 6% by 2100, underscoring the potential impact of climate change mitigation according with the Paris Agreement (
