 </ext-link>). However, our ensemble projections differed spatially from previous single-model results highlighted in the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report (
 <xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>): We found strong biomass declines (not increases) in many temperate to subtropical regions and increases (not declines) around Antarctica. The magnitude of regional changes also varied from other single-model results (

 <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref"/>–
 <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>). Generally, warming waters and enhanced primary production are expected to facilitate species expansions and biomass increases in polar regions, while tropical areas may experience pronounced species losses as thermal thresholds are exceeded. In temperate regions, warming is expected to change species composition, and reduced primary production due to enhanced stratification will result in biomass declines (

 <xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>). Our ensemble projections showed high model agreement on the direction of change in many ocean regions (75 to 100%;

  <italic class="italic">E</italic> and

 </xref>), providing confidence in our multimodel results that combine different ecosystem structures and processes. Many models also agreed relatively well on the magnitude of projected changes in temperate to tropical regions but showed considerable intermodel variability in many polar and coastal regions (
