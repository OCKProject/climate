<p class="p">Annual outputs of total animal biomass density (grams carbon per square meter) and animal biomass of &gt;10 cm and &gt;30 cm were derived on a 1 × 1 degree grid. We calculated time series of % biomass change from 1970 to 2100 relative to 1990–1999 (reference period), and % biomass change in 2090–2099 vs. 1990–1999 for each simulation, as absolute biomass densities were not strictly comparable across MEMs. Relative changes were combined into ensemble means and SD. The climate change effect [(RCP8.5 − RCP2.6)/RCP2.6] was calculated in a fished and unfished ocean within and across MEMs. Empirical validation was achieved by comparing historical projections with biomass trends of assessed fish stocks in a fished ocean (B/B

Trophic amplification was evaluated by comparing mean (±SD) changes (2090s vs. 1990s) in NPP and total phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass from ESMs with higher trophic level biomass from MEMs across RCPs. Mean biomass changes were also compared with global air temperature changes since preindustrial times (1861–1870) from ESMs. Spatial patterns were mapped as mean % biomass changes in 2090–2099 vs. 1990–1999, the SD of the mean to assess intermodel variability in the magnitude of change, and the % model agreement on the direction of change (
