<p id="P27" class="p">We project regional mean changes in FD and CD concentrations due to changes in SPEI02 between 2006 and 2099 relative to 1986–2005, using the equations shown in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. 
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 3</xref> shows the 20-year averaged annual mean changes in FD and CD concentrations centered around 2030, 2050, 2070, and 2090 under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 for the six CMIP5 models considered in this study (full time series are displayed in 
 <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">Figures S6</xref> and 
 <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S7</xref>). For context, observed 1988–2005 annual mean FD and CD concentrations averaged across the U.S. Southwest are 0.72 and 5.26 μg/m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>, respectively (CD is approximated from total coarse mass concentration). The multimodel mean increases in FD and CD concentrations for each era and RCP scenario combination are all statistically significant. Under RCP8.5, regional mean FD concentration is projected to increase by 30% (0.22 μg/m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>) in 2050 and by 57% (0.41 μg/m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>) in 2090, relative to the reference period. Regional mean CD concentration is projected to increase by 22% (1.14 μg/m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>) in 2050 and by 38% (1.98 μg/m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>) in 2090. In terms of individual model projections, GFDL-CM3 yields the highest increases in dust concentrations for both RCP scenarios across all eras, whereas GISS-E2-R yields the lowest increases, except for three instances in which CanESM2 projects the lowest increases (RCP8.5 2070 for FD and RCP8.5 2070–2090 for CD).
