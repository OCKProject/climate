<p id="P28" class="p">Projected changes in dust concentrations under the two RCP scenarios start to diverge around midcentury, following the projected decreases in SPEI02 (
 <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">Figure S8</xref>). Between 2006 and 2050, the multimodel mean SPEI02 values generally decrease under both RCP scenarios. However, this decreasing trend plateaus around midcentury at a value of −0.7 (“mild drought”) under RCP4.5 but continues to decrease under RCP8.5, reaching a value of around −1.1 (“moderately dry”) toward the end of this century. Projected increases in both FD and CD concentrations are approximately 30% larger in 2050 and 60% larger in 2090 under RCP8.5 compared to RCP4.5.
