<p id="P26" class="p">Results for the EOF-correlation-regression analysis for CD are very similar to those for FD (
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). The most dominant EOF modes of monthly mean CD concentrations also exhibit in-phase covariability across the U.S. Southwest, capturing 39–46% of the total variance depending on the season. This result indicates that ambient concentrations of dust particles in the coarse fraction are also influenced by large-scale controlling factors and/or source emissions. The PC1 time series are significantly and extensively correlated to SPEI02 across southwestern North America, especially within 29–41°N and 117–98°. A unit decrease in SPEI02 is significantly associated with increases of 1.10–2.19 μg/m
