<p id="P25" class="p">Between 2000 and 2013, the 35 IMPROVE sites located in our domain of interest started operating at different times and have varying intervals of missing data. Since a large proportion of the interannual variability in monthly mean FD concentrations for a given season displays regional coherence, we quantify the sensitivity of FD anomalies to SPEI02 using regional and seasonal means. In general, this leads to more robust sensitivities than at subregional or site-specific spatial scales. FD anomalies are averaged across the U.S. Southwest, and SPEI02 anomalies are averaged across domains in which the strongest correlations between PC1 and SPEI02 are observed for different seasons (all within 28–40°N and 117–103°W, outlined by black boxes in 
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>, middle row panels). As shown in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>, we find that a unit decrease in SPEI02 is significantly associated with increases of 0.22–0.44 μg/m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> in FD concentrations, depending on the season. These linear regression fits capture 48–72% of the total variance in seasonal and regional mean FD anomalies.
