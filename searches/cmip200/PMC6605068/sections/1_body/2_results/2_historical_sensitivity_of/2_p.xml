<p id="P24" class="p">We first perform EOF analysis to obtain the dominant patterns of variability in 2000–2013 monthly mean FD concentrations measured at 35 IMPROVE sites across the U.S. Southwest. As in A2018, we find that the most dominant EOF mode (EOF1) displays a coherent regional pattern of interannual variability, capturing 37– 53% of the total variance (
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). The principal component time series associated with EOF1 (PC1) are significantly negatively correlated to SPEI02 anomalies across southwestern North America, with the spatial pattern and strength of correlation varying by season. Regions of significant correlation encompass areas of known active dust sources, including the Great Basin, Mohave, Sonoran, and Chihuahuan Deserts, as well as the semiarid Columbia Plateau, Colorado Plateau, and southern Great Plains, which have been disturbed by human activities to varying extents (
