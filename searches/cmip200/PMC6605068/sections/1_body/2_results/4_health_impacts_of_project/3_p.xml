<p id="P30" class="p">In 2090 under RCP8.5 relative to the reference period, we estimate that annual FD-attributable mortality could increase by 230% (1,900 deaths per year) and hospital admissions could increase by 360% (2,200 admissions per year). The majority of FD-attributable premature mortality stems from cardiopulmonary-related deaths and has the highest incidence rates for adults aged 75 years and older (
 <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">Table S5</xref>). Even though hospitalization rates are held constant at 2014 values, the percentage increase in FD-attributable hospitalizations is greater than those in premature mortality because the elderly population size is expected to become much larger. The U.S. Southwest population is projected to increase by 170% for adults aged ≥30 years and by 310% for adults aged ≥65 years (

Annual CD-attributable cardiovascular mortality could increase by 210% (970 deaths per year) and asthma ED visits could increase by 88% (1,500 visits per year). Climate-driven changes in FD and CD concentrations alone can account for 34–47% of these increases (1,100 deaths and 1,400 hospital admissions and ED visits per year for FD and CD-related impacts combined), with the remaining fractions due to changes in population and baseline incidence rates. The highest incidence rates of CD-attributable cardiovascular mortalities and asthma ED visits are found in adults aged above 75 years and children aged 0–17 years, respectively, reflecting the differentiated vulnerability of different age groups to these health endpoints (

Summing up the health impacts of FD and CD together, dust-attributable premature mortality could increase by 220% and hospital admissions/visits could increase by 160% toward the end of this century, due to combined increases in population, baseline incidence rates, and dust levels.
