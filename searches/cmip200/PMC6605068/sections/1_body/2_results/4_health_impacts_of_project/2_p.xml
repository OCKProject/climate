 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> shows the health burdens attributable to FD and CD exposures for each endpoint in the reference period and the excess burdens estimated at each 20-year era due to changes in population and baseline incidence rates (AQ constant) or to the combined changes in population, baseline incidence rates, and dust concentrations under each RCP scenario. 
 <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figures 4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref> show the total annual number of incident cases attributable to FD and CD exposures, respectively, at each 20-year era under the AQ constant or RCP scenarios. The uncertainty ranges displayed reflect the lowest and highest estimates from the CMIP5 ensemble for a given RCP and era, reflecting variability across climate models rather than the uncertainty within any one model. In the following discussion, we focus on four health endpoints: (1) FD-attributableall-cause mortality for adults aged 30 years and older; (2) FD-attributable hospital admissions related to cardiovascular, acute myocardial infarction, and respiratory disorders for adults aged 65 years and older; (3) CD-attributable cardiovascular mortality for all ages; and (4) CD-attributable asthma ED visits for all ages. All reported values represent 20-year averages rounded to two significant figures.
