<p id="P32" class="p">Comparing the magnitudes of the excess burdens of FD-attributable cardiopulmonary mortality attributable to the CD-attributable cardiovascular mortality (which is approximated using cardiopulmonary incidence rates), the FD-attributable burdens are larger under all future scenarios and eras despite being quantified for a smaller population subset (30 years or older versus all age groups). The main reason for this is the higher relative risk value associated with PM
