<p id="P33" class="p">The total annual economic damages associated with FD-attributable health outcomes (all-cause mortality and cardiovascular, acute myocardial infarction, and respiratory hospital admissions) and with CD-attributable health outcomes (cardiovascular mortality and asthma ED visits) are displayed in 
 <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 6</xref> (see 
 <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">Table S6</xref> for a breakdown of the excess damages associated with each health endpoint). The annual value of total damages for the reference period is estimated to be $13 billion per year (2015$). Under RCP8.5, additional damages of $22 billion per year and $47 billion per year are estimated in 2050 and 2090, respectively. Climate-driven changes in FD and CD concentrations alone account for 27% of these excess values in 2050 and for 36% in 2090, with the rest due to changes in population and baseline incidence rates. The additional total damages under RCP8.5 exceed those under RCP4.5 for all eras, with the differences growing over time. The total excess damages are ~16% higher ($6.4 billion per year) in 2090 under RCP8.5 relative to RCP4.5. If the expected increases in population and baseline incidence rates are accounted for (i.e., comparing the excess damages due to climate-driven changes in dust concentrations alone), this percentage difference becomes ~60%. Nearly all (&gt;99%) of total damages estimated for the reference period and future scenarios arise from FD- and CD- attributable mortality, with the majority (around two thirds) due to FD.
