<p id="P8" class="p">In this study, we apply and extend the methods developed by A2018 to assess how climate-driven increases in aridity may impact ambient levels of FD and coarse dust (CD) and to evaluate the public health impacts and associated economic damages using the CIRA framework. Following A2018, we use the 2-month SPEI as a drought proxy rather than focusing on soil moisture. This is because of the very limited availability of spatially and temporally extensive soil moisture measurements with which to carry out our sensitivity analysis, as well as the lack of downscaled soil moisture projections from global climate models. Conversely, drought indices such as the SPEI can be readily calculated from existing downscaled temperature and precipitation observations and modeled data. The CIRA projectâ€™s use of consistent socioeconomic and climate change projections allows for comparison of climate-attributable impacts across space, time, and sectors under multiple emissions scenarios (
