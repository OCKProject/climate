<p id="P5" class="p">Decades of epidemiological studies have established that short- and long-term exposures to PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> are associated with a broad range of adverse cardiovascular and respiratory effects, including lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, myocardial infarction (heart attack), and asthma development and exacerbation (

 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub>, evidence regarding the health effects of PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5-10</sub> is less conclusive. Nonetheless, a confluence of existing evidence from epidemiological, toxicological, and controlled human exposure studies is suggestive of a causal relationship between PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5-10</sub> exposure and respiratory and cardiovascular effects, in particular asthma exacerbation and cardiovascular mortality (

Additionally, samples of desert dust collected at various sites across the western United States have been shown to cause respiratory cell damage in in vitro toxicology studies, most likely due to its primary component, silica (
