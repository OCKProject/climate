 <xref rid="R74" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">U.S. Global Change Research Program, 2017</xref>). In southwestern states, soil-derived mineral dust particles are major components of ambient fine PM (aerodynamic diameter ≤ 2.5 μm, PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub>) and coarse PM (aerodynamic diameter between 2.5 and 10 μm, PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5-10</sub>), which both contribute to air pollution and visibility degradation. Ground-based observations indicate that dust in these states constitutes up to ~50% of monthly mean PM

Previous studies have found that fluctuations in ambient dust levels across the U.S. Southwest in the past 20–30 years are influenced by high wind events, human land disturbance, and regional hydroclimate conditions, the last of which is partially controlled by large-scale changes in sea surface temperature and/or atmospheric circulation patterns, including the El Niño–Southern Oscillation and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (
