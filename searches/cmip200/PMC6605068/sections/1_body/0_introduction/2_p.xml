Climate models consistently project that southwestern North America, a region containing extensive wind-erodible and human-disturbed drylands and deserts, will transition to an even more arid hydroclimate under continued greenhouse gas (GHG) forcing (

 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Achakulwisut et al. (2018)</xref> provided one of the first estimates of the climate-attributable impacts on fine dust (FD) and public health in the U.S. Southwest. Here, we apply and extend methods developed by Achakulwisut et al. to investigate the sensitivity of ambient dust levels in the U.S. Southwest to regional drought conditions and use the observed relationships to assess potential changes in dust levels and associated public health impacts under different climate change and socioeconomic scenarios consistent with the Environmental Protection Agencyâ€™s (EPA) Climate Change Impacts and Risk Analysis (CIRA) framework (
