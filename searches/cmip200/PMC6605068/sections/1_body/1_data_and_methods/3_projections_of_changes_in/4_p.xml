 <xref rid="R68" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">U.S. EPA, 2017a</xref>), the six models considered here are a subset of the 22 included by A2018. Changes in regional mean SPEI02 over southwestern North America projected by the subset of six models capture the lower limits (i.e., smallest decreases in SPEI02) of the full range but fall below the upper limits projected by other models not considered here.
