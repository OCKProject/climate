<p id="P12" class="p">In order to compare our results to other climate-related impacts reported in the 2017 CIRA report, we select future scenarios and meteorological projections to be consistent with the CIRA framework. Projections of 2006–2099 monthly mean SPEI02 are calculated using statistically downscaled meteorological output from six global climate models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5;
