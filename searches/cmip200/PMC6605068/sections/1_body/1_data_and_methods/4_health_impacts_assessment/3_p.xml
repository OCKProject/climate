<p id="P17" class="p">For each health endpoint, we perform three sets of calculations: (1) The historical reference burden is estimated using the 1988–2005 annual mean FD or CD concentration combined with 2010 population and baseline incidence rates (IMPROVE measurements are only available from 1988 onward); (2) the “AQ constant” scenario considers projected changes in population and baseline incidence rates for each era while dust concentrations are held constant at the reference value; and (3) the “RCP” scenarios consider projected changes in dust concentrations, population, and baseline incidence rates all together—that is, FD or CD concentration is calculated as the annual mean increase under each RCP scenario on top of the reference average concentration. The difference between (3) and (1) represents the excess burden relative to the reference estimate due to projected changes in all three variables (dust concentrations, population, and baseline incidence rates). The proportion of this excess burden arising from expected changes in population and baseline incidence rates is given by (2)-(1), and the proportion due to climate-driven changes in dust concentrations is given by (3)-(2). The same projections of population, baseline incidence rate, and valuation parameters are applied to the two RCPs in (3) so that differences between the RCP scenarios are only due to those in climate-driven meteorological changes and not socioeconomic factors. Since the model spread is much larger than the uncertainty intervals of relative risk estimates (see 
 <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">Figures S4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S5</xref>), we report uncertainty ranges for the health burden and valuation estimates in terms of the lowest and highest values projected by the CMIP5 model ensemble. Additional data inputs to BenMAP-CE are described below.
