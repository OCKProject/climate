<p id="P18" class="p">To calculate the reference pollutant concentrations, we use the 1988â€“2005 seasonal mean concentrations of FD and CD measured at each of the 35 monitoring sites. To calculate the projected dust concentrations for each era, RCP scenario, and CMIP5 model, the regional and seasonal mean 20-year increment of FD or CD concentration is uniformly added to the reference concentration at each monitoring site. The Voronoi Neighborhood Averaging interpolation method (without setting a maximum distance) is used to grid the reference and projected FD and CD concentrations across our study domain (
