 <xref rid="R69" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">U.S. EPA, 2017b</xref>). The ICLUSv2 model disaggregates national population projections from the Median Variant Projection of the United Nations, UN, 2015 World Population Prospects data set (

 <xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">O’Neill et al., 2014</xref>). The impacts of climate change are not factored into the national-level projections provided by the UN but are accounted for by the ICLUSv2 model in the development of county-level population size and demographics (i.e., age, gender, and race) from the national-level UN projections.
