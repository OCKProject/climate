<p id="P21" class="p">We analyze separate health endpoints for FD and CD, focusing on outcomes with the most robust epidemiological evidence for total PM in the two size fractions. For FD, we consider all-cause, cardiopulmonary, and lung cancer mortality, using CRFs from 
 <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Krewski et al. (2009)</xref>. We also consider two morbidity endpoints, cardiovascular and respiratory hospital admissions, using CRFs from 
 <xref rid="R87" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Zanobetti et al. (2009)</xref>. Within the cardiovascular subgroup, nonfatal acute myocardial infarctions are calculated separately following 
 <xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Peters et al. (2001)</xref>. Except for the addition of nonfatal myocardial infarction, these CRFs are consistent with those used in A2018. For CD, we apply CRFs derived from two multicity studies conducted in California (
