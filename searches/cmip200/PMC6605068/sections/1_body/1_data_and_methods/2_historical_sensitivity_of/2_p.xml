<p id="P9" class="p">As detailed in A2018, we first use empirical orthogonal function (EOF), correlation, and regression analyses to investigate and quantify the historical sensitivity of FD to drought conditions on interannual time scales. In this study, we extend this analysis to dust particles in the coarse mass fraction. Surface monthly mean FD and CD concentrations are derived from 24-hr averaged measurements made every third day by the Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments (IMPROVE) network at 35 sites located in the southwestern United States (defined here as 31–41°N,115–103°W; spanning Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah). The locations of the 35 IMPROVE sites in our study domain are shown in 
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>. The IMPROVE network began operation in 1988 with 20 sites and expanded to 165 sites between 2000 and 2003, with the majority of sites located in remote and rural locations across the United States (

Although long-term speciated coarse PM measurements are not available, observations made at one site within our study domain (Grand Canyon, AZ) between 2003 and 2004 show that 76% of coarse PM is composed of soil-derived particles (
