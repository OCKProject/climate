The global 0.1° × 0.1° gridded SPEI database provided by the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) calculates the potential evapotranspiration (PET) from the commonly used Food and Agriculture Organization Penman-Monteith equation. However, this requires many variables not readily available from climate model projections. Here, we calculate historical (1950–2013) monthly mean SPEI02 based on the Modified-Hargreaves PET equation, using daily precipitation, maximum, and minimum temperature data from

 <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Droogers and Allen (2002)</xref> demonstrated that the Modified-Hargreaves is a robust alternative to the Penman-Monteith equation in situations that involve a high level of uncertainty and anticipated inaccuracy in the parameters (wind speed and relative humidity) needed for Penman-Monteith. We find good agreement between monthly mean SPEI02 averaged over southwestern North America from the CSIC database and our calculated values (
