<p id="P41" class="p">Our findings suggest that airborne levels of soil-derived components of PM may increase in the U.S. Southwest due to increasing aridity, especially under RCP8.5. Future model studies should strive to capture the observed sensitivity of ambient dust concentrations to regional drought conditions. Compared to other U.S. sectors, the estimated economic damages from dust-related mortality rank fourth behind national-scale climate impacts on extreme temperature mortality, labor productivity decline, and coastal property loss and should be further studied and potentially considered in future estimates of health damages from climate change in the United States. This climate impact on air quality may also apply to other populated arid regions around the world.</p>
