<p id="P37" class="p">In this study, we choose to consider only the future effects of aridity on ambient dust concentrations, given the strength of evidence in its role in influencing long-term variations in dust concentrations and the robustness of its response to GHG forcing. However, it remains inconclusive how the hydroclimate of southwestern North America will be influenced by potential changes in the El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation and Pacific Decadal Oscillation in response to climate change (

In previous work, we did not identify surface wind speed or vegetation as dominant controlling factors of regional-scale dust activity, perhaps because of the time scales considered or the inability of reanalysis data to resolve local complex terrain and wind dynamics (

We have also not accounted for changes in other potentially important controlling factors such as land use changes (e.g., those associated with increased development or agricultural activities) or the trans-Pacific transport of Asian dust. Future changes in other controlling factors of dust activity such as the ones listed here may dampen or exacerbate our projections. Future efforts to minimize exposure by climate adaptation or regulatory programs, including dust-forecasting systems or programs to reduce fugitive dust emissions from agricultural activities, could also reduce some of the projected increases in dust concentrations and/or health impacts.
