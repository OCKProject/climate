<p id="P38" class="p">There will also likely be other health impacts of dust exposure not included in this study. For example, higher ambient dust concentrations could lead to increased exposures of known soil-borne contaminants in the U.S. Southwest such as heavy metals from mining operations and the Valley Fever-causing
