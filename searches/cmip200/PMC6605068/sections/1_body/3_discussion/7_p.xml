<p id="P39" class="p">There are also several limitations in our approach. First, due to limited data availability, we use PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub>-Iron measurements as a FD proxy and approximate CD concentrations from total coarse PM measurements, which can include other nondust components. Second, we estimate the long-term health impacts of FD and coarse mass exposures using epidemiological relationships derived for total fine or coarse PM and for the range of present-day concentrations. Future epidemiological studies targeting soil-derived particles can help to better constrain the health impacts of ambient dust exposure in the U.S. Southwest. Third, BenMAP-CE provides projections in mortality incidence rates up to 2060 only and no projections are available for morbidity rates. A few studies suggest that future rates in the next 5â€“15 years of cardiovascular-related hospital visits may decrease, while those for respiratory outcomes may increase (

Fourth, in estimating economic damages, we assume that the premature mortality attributable to the FD and CD fractions are additive because there is technically no overlap in the diameter range of the two PM fractions. However, in practice, this issue is still up for debate owing to uncertainties in separating the health impacts attributable to fine and coarse PM in epidemiological studies. Finally, we assume that the dust-drought relationships derived in the historical reference period will remain constant in the future and use annual mean dust concentrations as a surrogate for daily mean concentrations in assessing some short-term morbidity impacts (hospital admissions and ED visits). However, these relationships do not account for potential future shifts in the intensity, duration, and frequency of extreme dust events.
