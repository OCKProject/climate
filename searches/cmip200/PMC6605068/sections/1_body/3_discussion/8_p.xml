<p id="P40" class="p">The ranges of uncertainties displayed in our health burden and valuation estimates reflect those in the downscaled meteorological outputs of six CMIP5 models. We compare the relative size of uncertainties in three input variables to equations (
 <xref rid="FD2" ref-type="disp-formula" class="xref">2a</xref>) and (
 <xref rid="FD3" ref-type="disp-formula" class="xref">2b</xref>)â€”calculated as percentage differences relative to the central estimate of each variable: relative risk, linear sensitivity of regional mean FD or coarse mass concentrations to SPEI02, and the spread in the CMIP5 model projections of changes in FD or coarse mass concentrations under each RCP scenario (
 <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">Figures S4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S5</xref>). The relative risk estimates have the narrowest confidence intervals, whereas uncertainties in the other two variables are much larger and comparable. Within the baseline and projected FD and coarse mass concentrations, the health burdens calculated from equation (
 <xref rid="FD2" ref-type="disp-formula" class="xref">2a</xref>) or (
 <xref rid="FD3" ref-type="disp-formula" class="xref">2b</xref>) would scale approximately linearly with changes in each of these three variables. We are unable to quantify uncertainties in other input variables including baseline incidence rates and population estimates.
