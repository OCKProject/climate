 <p id="P2" class="p">The southwestern United States is projected to experience severe, multidecadal droughts due to human-caused climate change. Mineral dust particles are a major contributor to air pollution in this region due to abundant deserts and drylands. To what extent could airborne dust levels increase as a result of the projected drought conditions? To answer this question, we first investigate the influence of drought conditions across southwestern North America on dust activity in recent years. We then use the observed relationships between dust and droughts to estimate future changes in dust levels—and the associated excess deaths and illnesses—through the end of the century, using projections of temperature and precipitation from global climate models following two plausible (high and intermediate) greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. Under the high emissions scenario, premature mortality associated with dust exposure increases by 220% and hospitalization increases by 160% toward the end of this century, due to combined increases in population, disease rates, and dust levels. The annual economic damages of these health impacts are estimated to be $47 billion per year additional to the present-day value of $13 billion per year, making climate-driven changes in dust concentrations one of the costliest impacts projected for the United States so far.</p>
