<p class="p">Schistosomiasis is not as neglected as many other tropical diseases since it has a large research focus and still remains one of the most prevalent infections in the world, estimated to correspond to 4.5 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) by the WHO Expert Committee in 2002 [
 <xref rid="B5-tropicalmed-03-00117" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. However, this estimate was based on a wider range of pathologies than that used in the global burden of disease (GBD) study of 1990 [
 <xref rid="B6-tropicalmed-03-00117" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. It was also higher than the updated GBD in 2010 [
 <xref rid="B7-tropicalmed-03-00117" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>] that put the burden of schistosomiasis at 3.3 million DALYs. Importantly, however, the GBD figure of 2010 was high enough to put this disease as no. 3 after malaria and tuberculosis on the NTD list [
 <xref rid="B3-tropicalmed-03-00117" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. This increase was due to the inclusion of diarrhea, dysuria and anemia in the DALY score which was not counted before. While later updates [
 <xref rid="B8-tropicalmed-03-00117" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>] show a sharply lower DALY score for schistosomiasis, other authors [
 <xref rid="B9-tropicalmed-03-00117" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-tropicalmed-03-00117" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="B11-tropicalmed-03-00117" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>] hold that the true impact of this disease is several-fold higher because of the low weight given by the GBD estimates to subtle symptoms and pathology in individuals with infections too light to be revealed by diagnostics based on parasite egg-detection. Indeed, high-definition circulating antigen tests, such as the point-of-care circulating cathodic antigen (POC-CCA) assay indicates that the current number of infections may be at least 10 times higher than that shown by egg-detection [
