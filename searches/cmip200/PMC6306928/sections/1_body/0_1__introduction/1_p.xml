<p class="p">Schistosomiasis, caused by trematode parasites with a predilection for intestinal and urogenital venous circulation in the human definitive host, is one of the neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) selected for increased attention by the World Health Organization (WHO) [
 <xref rid="B1-tropicalmed-03-00117" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Six different species of 
 <italic class="italic">Schistosoma</italic> are capable of infecting humans, each depending on a certain snail species as an intermediate host. Humans infect snails by depositing parasite eggs (excreted in feces or urine) in waterlogged areas and humans are infected or reinfected when in contact with water containing schistosome cercariae released from infected snails. The disease is generally chronic, although schistosomiasis is often a contributing factor to premature death, direct mortality is comparatively low. Transmission of schistosomiasis has been reported in 78 countries and more than 800 million people in Africa, Latin America, the Middle East and Southeast Asia live in areas endemic to schistosomiasis [
 <xref rid="B2-tropicalmed-03-00117" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>], with up to 250 million actually infected [
 <xref rid="B3-tropicalmed-03-00117" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Chemotherapy in amounts sufficient for more than 100 million school age children per year has been pledged by the private sector and development partners, but there is still a large discrepancy between the number of people requiring preventive treatment and those actually receiving it [
 <xref rid="B4-tropicalmed-03-00117" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. In addition, the number of people suffering from this infection continues to rise as a reflection of ongoing population growth, which is particularly high in endemic areas.
