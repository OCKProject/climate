<p class="p">The average temperatures predicted by the IPCC for the two time periods 2021–2050 and 2071–2100, based on the average of the five GCM results, seemed increasingly likely in the event that efforts to curb the GHG emissions were not stepped up more than they were so far.

The blue color shown in the figures designated the ocean, while the background of each plot was based on the PTI baseline.
