<p class="p">For 
 <italic class="italic">S. japonicum</italic>, we only applied the low temperature constraints. The global warming displayed heterogeneous patterns with respect to snail survival. For example, the current areas endemic for 
 <italic class="italic">S. japonicum</italic> in the Sichuan Province were predicted to become unsuitable for snail habitats. On the other hand, the downstream regions between the Sichuan and Hunan/Hubei provinces corresponding to the area above the Three Gorges Dam, which is currently non-endemic, might well present a potential endemic risk in the future. The predicted potential transmission areas of 
 <italic class="italic">S. japonicum</italic> moving northward was not so obvious in 2021–2050 as it might have become in the 2071–2100 period.
