<p class="p">Three schistosome species pose the main infection risk for humans. 
 <italic class="italic">S. japonicum</italic> is the single schistosome species in China, the Philippines and three closely situated small foci in Celebes, Indonesia. It is transmitted by 
 <italic class="italic">Oncomelania</italic> snails, whose latitudinal movements over land during most of the last million years may have been prevented by the development of the Himalaya plateau serving as a barrier. The endemic areas for 
 <italic class="italic">S. mansoni</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. haematobium</italic> overlap to a great extent on the African continent and in the Middle East, but not everywhere. The former, the most abundant of the schistosome species, has also found an exclusive niche in the Northeast part of South America and on some of the Caribbean islands but are now disappearing from the latter, however this is not due to climate change [
 <xref rid="B29-tropicalmed-03-00117" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Its distribution is supported by the broad geographic range of 
 <italic class="italic">Biomphalaria</italic> spp. snails that serve as obligatory hosts for its larval stages. Recently, however, 
 <italic class="italic">Bi. straminea</italic> has been identified in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Shenzhen City in the Guangdong Province of China and has remained there since the 1970s [
 <xref rid="B30-tropicalmed-03-00117" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>], a fact that could eventually result in transmission of 
 <italic class="italic">S. mansoni</italic> in parallel with 
 <italic class="italic">S. japonicum</italic> in China. 
 <italic class="italic">S. haematobium</italic> is confined to Africa and the Middle East due to its reliance on 
 <italic class="italic">Bulinus</italic> spp. intermediate snail hosts [
 <xref rid="B31-tropicalmed-03-00117" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Although this schistosome species must also have been brought from Africa to Latin America during the slave trade of the 16th and 17th century, only 
 <italic class="italic">S. mansoni</italic> became established there because of the absence of 
 <italic class="italic">Bulinus</italic> snails. Although this information indicates that schistosome species and their specific snails can spread into various new areas, this is not of a magnitude that requires it to be considered when discussing the risk for schistosomiasis due to temperature augmentation.
