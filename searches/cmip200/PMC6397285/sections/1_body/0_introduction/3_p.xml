 </sup>. Under the influence of global warming, permafrost temperature has evidently shown an increasing trend since 1980 in most parts of the NH
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">24</xref>
 </sup>. However, because of the spatial differences found in climate change itself, as well as the heterogeneity of soil properties, there remain regional differences in soil temperatures, permafrost boundaries and active layer thicknesses (ALT)
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">25</xref>
 </sup>. A number of studies have reported these regional variations in the effects of global warming on the permafrost layer. For example, the temperature at a depth of 20 m in the permafrost has increased at a rate of 0.13 °C/a in northern Alaska since the 1980s
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>
 </sup>. The temperature at a depth of 6 m in the permafrost increased by an amount between 0.12 °C and 0.67 °C on the high-altitude Qinghai–Tibet Plateau over the period 1996–2006
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>
 </sup>. In northern Europe, permafrost temperature increased by an amount between 0.3 °C and 2 °C between 1971 and 2010
