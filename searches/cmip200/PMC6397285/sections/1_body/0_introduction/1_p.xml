<p id="Par2" class="p">Frozen ground is composed of various ice-rich soils and rocks, which are the products of lithosphere–soil–atmosphere interactions during the process of material exchange. Permafrost is a key component of the cryosphere, which occupies around a quarter of the Earth’s land area in the Northern Hemisphere

 </sup>, the risk of permafrost degradation has also increased. The degradation of the permafrost may affect the climate system via many factors such as local ecological balance, hydrological processes, energy exchange and the carbon cycle, as well as the engineering infrastructure in cold regions and even extreme weather events
