<p id="Par3" class="p">Over the last 100 years, global climate has warmed distinctly, with the global surface temperature increasing by 0.74 °C ± 0.18 °C between 1906 and 2005

 </sup>. In particular, over the past 30 years, the Earth has experienced a period of rapid warming. The increase in observed global average surface temperature between 1880 and 2012 was 0.85 (0.65–1.06) °C

 </sup>. However, the magnitude of warming shows remarkable regional differences. Regions of significant warming include the high latitudes of the NH, including Arctic and high-elevation areas such as the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau. Warming in these areas is the most significant over this period, reaching up to 2.5 °C
