<p id="Par72" class="p">Under the RCP4.5 scenario, TX95 estimates in northern SA and the Atacama Desert are projected to increase by 5-10 times (from 5% in 1961–1990 to 25–50% in 2046–2055), while the HW days per season (HWF
 <bold class="bold">)</bold> are expected to rise from less than 3 days in 1961–1990 to 15–30 days in 2046–2055. The increments in TX95 estimates and HW metrics are less pronounced in southern SA. Extremely warm DJF days in southern Patagonia are expected to increase from 5% in 1961–1990 to about 10% in 2046–2055, while the HW days per season (HWF
 <bold class="bold">)</bold> are expected to rise from about 1 days in 1961–1990 to about 5 days in 2046–2055. HWF estimates are expected to remain below 15 days per season in Southern Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay, and Argentina. Under the RCP4.5 scenario, by mid-century, the number of HWs per season (HWN) is expected to at least double in southern SA, while they may increase 5–10 times or more in the Atacama Desert and along the coastline of northern SA. Indeed, by mid-century HWN estimates are expected to range from less that 2 in southern SA to more than 3 in northern SA and the Atacama Desert.
