<p id="Par70" class="p">Moreover, RCM and GCM simulations were exploited in order to project both TX95 estimates and HW metrics according to two representative concentration pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). Although both TX95 estimates and HW metrics were computed for each model separately (either GCM or RCM), our results are based on the multi model mean (MMM) of the HW metrics and the TX95 values. RCM and GCM simulations exhibited similar regional features, though some differences (likely related to the coarser resolution of GCMs) were apparent especially in coastal zones and in areas of complicated topography (such as the Andean Region).</p>
