<p id="Par69" class="p">In this paper, quality-controlled long-term observations from nine weather stations in SA were used to assess four HW metrics (HWD, HWF, HWA and HWN), as well as the share of extremely warm DJF days (TX95). We found that the share of extremely warm DJF days has at least doubled in recent decades in northern SA; less significant increases were observed in southern SA.</p>
