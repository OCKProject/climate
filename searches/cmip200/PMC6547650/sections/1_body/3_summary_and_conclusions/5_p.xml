<p id="Par73" class="p">TX95 projections under the RCP8.5 scenario show larger increases. By the end of the century, TX95 estimates are projected to reach almost 100% in northern SA and more than 80% in the Atacama Desert. The number of extremely warm days would also increase at higher latitudes under the RCP8.5 scenario but less significantly; TX95 estimates are expected to range from 20% to 40% by the end of the century in the case of locations at latitudes higher than 20Â°S.</p>
