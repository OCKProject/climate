<p id="Par74" class="p">Tropical major cities are expected to be strongly affected by HWs and daily record temperatures. In Caracas for example, TX95 estimates under the RCP4.5 scenario are projected to increase about 7 times (up to 34% in 2046–2055), while in Guayaquil, they are expected to rise up to 9 times (up to 45% in 2046–2055). Increases in the extremely warm DJF days in major cities in southern SA are projected to be less significant. In Buenos Aires and Santiago for example, under the RCP4.5 scenario, the share of extremely warm DJF days is expected to rise from 5% over the base period to 9–10% in 2046–2055.</p>
