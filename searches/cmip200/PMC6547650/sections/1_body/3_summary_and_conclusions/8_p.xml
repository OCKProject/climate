 </sup> exposing vulnerable and disadvantaged populations (especially in northern SA) to further risks. Increases in HWs pose a serious challenge to countries in northern SA (all developing countries) due to their vulnerability (determined by population density, percentage of the poor population and their spatial distribution)

 </sup>. These facts underline the importance of curbing GHG emissions, especially for countries in northern SA. Since there are substantial differences between TX95 estimates in tropical areas under different scenarios (RCP8.5 and RCP4.5), limiting global warming will make a significant difference in the number of extremely warm days that population at low latitudes will have to endure by mid century.
