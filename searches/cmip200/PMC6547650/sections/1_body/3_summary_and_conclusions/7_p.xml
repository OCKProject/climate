<p id="Par75" class="p">As expected, projected changes under the RCP8.5 scenario are more severe. However, the extremely warm DJF days expected by mid century under RCP8.5 scenario are substantially greater in tropical areas than those projected under the RCP4.5 scenario. For example, in Caracas TX95 is 46% for RCP8.5 and 34% for RCP4.5, while in Guayaquil TX95 is 60% for RCP8.5 and 45% for RCP4.5. The number of extremely warm days will also increase at higher latitudes under the RCP8.5 scenario but less significantly. For example, by mid century in Santiago TX95 is 14% for RCP8.5 and 10% for RCP4.5, while in Buenos Aires TX95 is 12% for RCP8.5 and 9% for RCP4.5.</p>
