<p id="Par63" class="p">We explored the effects on our GCM-based results of selecting different ensemble members. In particular, we compared TX95 estimates computed over the period 2046–2055 by using different ensemble members corresponding to the following GCMs: EC-EARTH (9 ensembles), CSIRO-Mk3-6-0 (9 ensembles), and CanESM2 (5 ensembles). We did not find significant differences between TX95 estimates based on different ensemble members (see Figs 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>–
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>), which suggests that the selection of a specific ensemble member (i.e. the
