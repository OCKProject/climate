 </sup>, we did find significant inter-model differences in the case of RCMs (note the spread of TX95 predictions from different models in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8a–i</xref>) as well as in the case of GCMs (note the spread of TX95 predictions from different models in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9a–h</xref>), mainly in northern SA. The inter-model differences were characterized by computing the standard deviation (STD) of the spread of decadal TX95 estimates (2046–2055) from different models. Figure
