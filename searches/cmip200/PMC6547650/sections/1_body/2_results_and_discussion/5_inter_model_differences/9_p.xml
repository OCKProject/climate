 </sup>), in this study our projections are based on the MMM. Figures 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3m</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5m</xref> show the MMM of TX95 estimates computed from RCM and GCM simulations, respectively, over the period 2046–2055 under the RCP4.5 scenario. It is worth comparing Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3m</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5m</xref> with Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8j</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9i</xref>, which show STD values of TX95 estimates (2046–2055) computed from the models used in this study. It can be observed in these figures that the expected increase in the share of extremely warm DJF days in northern SA (up to 50% in 2046–2055) is twice as high as the STD values also in northern SA (up to 25% in 2046–2055). In southern SA, the signal-to-noise ratio (MMM/STD) is similarly strong. Although they cannot mask the significant increases in TX95 estimates expected by mid-century, the inter-model differences shown in Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9</xref> do affect the uncertainty of our projections.
