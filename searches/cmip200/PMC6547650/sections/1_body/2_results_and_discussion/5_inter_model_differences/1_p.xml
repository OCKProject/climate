<p id="Par59" class="p">Our projections, based on the MMM of both HW metrics and TX95 values, may be affected by the selection of ensembles and models. We explored the effects of selecting different models on the results. In particular, we compared TX95 estimates computed under the RCP4.5 scenario over the period 2046–2055 by using 9 RCMs (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8a–i</xref>) and by 8 GCMs (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9a–h</xref>). Comparing Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8a</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9a</xref> (as well as Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8b</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9b</xref> and so on), we found in general terms a good agreement between RCMs and their corresponding GCMs (i.e. the GCM that drove the RCM). Similarly to our findings when comparing MMM values, significant differences between the RCM estimates and their corresponding GCMs were found at certain locations (for example, those surrounded by a complicated topography).
