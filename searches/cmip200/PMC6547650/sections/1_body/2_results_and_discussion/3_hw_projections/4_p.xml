<p id="Par40" class="p">HWN projections exhibit similar regional features as both HWF and TX95 estimates. Under the RCP4.5 scenario, by mid-century, the number of HWs is expected to at least double in southern SA, while they may increase 5â€“10 times at locations in the Atacama Desert and along the coastline of northern SA. These figures depict a significantly severer scenario than in central Europe, for example, where by mid-century HWN estimates (according to the 90th percentile) are expected to double in summer under the RCP4.5 scenario
