<p id="Par48" class="p">The differences shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S5</xref> between RCMs and GCMs may also be influenced by the variability of the simulated data. For example, a smaller variability leads to narrower frequency distributions of the daily maximum temperatures, which renders more extreme warm days than wider frequency distributions under similar increases in the mean temperature. As shown elsewhere

 </sup>, the effect of the variability can lead to differences between RCM-based and GCM-based estimates, and may explain why RCM-based projections appear to be biased cold with respect to GCM-based projections in Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S5</xref>. In our case, GCMs simulated narrower frequency distributions than RCMs’, making GCM-based TX95 estimates higher than the corresponding RCM-based TX95 estimates. Still, with the exception of Santiago (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S5f</xref>; where the topography likely plays a dominant role), the differences between RCM-based and GCM-based TX95 estimates shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S5</xref> become significant only after mid-century.
