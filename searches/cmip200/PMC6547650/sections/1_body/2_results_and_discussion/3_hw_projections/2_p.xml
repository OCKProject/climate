HWs are expected to be more frequent and last longer, especially in northern SA (including the northern Amazon region) as well as in the Atacama Desert. In these areas, the extremely warm DJF days (TX95) are projected to increase by 5–10 times (from 5% in 1961–1990 to 25–50% in 2046–2055), while the HW days per season (HWF
