<p id="Par42" class="p">HWA estimates exhibit different regional features than other HW metrics. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> shows that the T
 <sub class="sub">MAX</sub> anomaly of the hottest day of the HWs is expected to increase about 2 °C throughout SA. Unlike the changes in other HW metrics, the increments in HWA projected by midcentury do not exhibit clear regional features (although increments are somehow larger in Brazil and at high altitude Andean locations). Nevertheless, by midcentury, Patagonia (southern Argentina and Chile) is expected to undergo HW amplitudes of up to 10 °C, whereas HWA estimates in northern SA and the northern Amazon region are expected to remain below 6 °C.
