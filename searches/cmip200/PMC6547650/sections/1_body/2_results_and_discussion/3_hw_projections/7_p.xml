<p id="Par43" class="p">Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> shows the MMM of the TX95 estimates and of the HW metrics computed from RCM simulations over the period to 2091–2100 under the RCP4.5 scenario (1
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> row), as well as the change, 1961–1990 to 2091–2100 (RCP4.5), in TX95 estimates and in the HW metrics (2
 <sup class="sup">nd</sup> row). Compared with changes by mid century (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>), projections are more striking by the end of the century. Indeed, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> shows that even under the RCP4.5 scenario, half or more of the DJF days are expected to be extremely warm by the end of the century in northern SA and in the Atacama Desert. Although increases shown in Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> exhibit very similar regional features, TX95 estimates and HW metrics in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> are in general 25–50% higher than those in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>.
