<p id="Par37" class="p">RCM and GCM simulations were exploited in order to project HW metrics in SA according to the representative concentration pathway RCP4.5. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> shows the MMM of HW metrics computed from RCM simulations over the base period 1961–1990 (1

 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> also shows the change, 1961–1990 to 2046–2055 (RCP4.5), in TX95 estimates and in HW metrics (3
