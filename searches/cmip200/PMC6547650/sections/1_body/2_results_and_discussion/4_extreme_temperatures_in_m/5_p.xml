<p id="Par53" class="p">As expected, the increments in the TX95 estimates and the HW metrics are higher under the RCP 8.5 scenario than under the RCP4.5 scenario. However, there are significant regional differences in these increments. The percentage of extremely warm DJF days is only slightly higher in absolute terms for RCP8.5 than for RCP4.5 at latitudes higher than 30°S. For example, TX95 estimates in Santiago are 14% for RCP8.5 and 10% for RCP4.5 by mid century (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7h</xref>); TX95 estimates in Buenos Aires for RCP8.5 and for RCP4.5 are 12% and 9%, respectively (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7i</xref>). The differences in TX95 estimates between RCP8.5 and RCP4.5 are substantially greater in absolute terms in tropical areas. For example, in Caracas TX95 is 46% for RCP8.5 and 34% for RCP4.5 (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7a</xref>), in Bogotá TX95 is 71% for RCP8.5 and 54% for RCP4.5 (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7b</xref>), in Guayaquil (Fortaleza) TX95 is 60% (68%) for RCP8.5 and 45% (52%) for RCP4.5 (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7c–d</xref>), and in Lima TX95 is 57% for RCP8.5 and 42% for RCP4.5 (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7e</xref>).
