 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>, regardless of the locations in SA, there are no great differences between STD values corresponding to the base period 1961–1990 and STD values corresponding to the period 2046–2055 (for both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). Therefore, the role of the variability in the expected TX95 increases is likely minor.
