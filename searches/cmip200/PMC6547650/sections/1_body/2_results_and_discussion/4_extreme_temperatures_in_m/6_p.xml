 </sup>. Most of these regional differences result from the fact that the variability of the T
 <sub class="sub">MAX</sub> anomalies (i.e. the STD value) tends to be smaller in the tropics than at higher latitudes. STDs of the T
 <sub class="sub">MAX</sub> anomalies are depicted at the upper left corner of each plot in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>. These STD values confirm that the variability of the T
 <sub class="sub">MAX</sub> anomalies is significantly higher in southern SA (Santiago or Buenos Aires) than in the tropics (Sao Paulo or Caracas). This result is consistent with prior efforts that have found a relatively small variability at low latitude locations

 </sup>. A smaller variability leads to narrower frequency distributions of the T
 <sub class="sub">MAX</sub> anomalies, which renders more extreme warm days than wider frequency distributions under similar increases in the mean temperature. As shown in the histograms in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>, although the shifts in the mean (TXM) were comparable, increases in the share of extremely warm days (TX95) are substantially larger in the case of tropical locations (such as Caracas or Sao Paulo) than in the case of mid-latitude locations (such as Santiago or Buenos Aires). Indeed, in tropical regions, where the present-day variability and the seasonal cycle are small, even a moderate mean temperature increase results in more heat waves
