<p id="Par51" class="p">Under the RCP4.5 scenario, extremely warm DJF days (TX95) are expected to increase by about 10 times (from 5% in 1961–1990 to above 50% in 2046–2055) in Bogota (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7b</xref>) and Fortaleza (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7d</xref>); while in Caracas (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7a</xref>), Guayaquil (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7c</xref>) and Lima (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7e</xref>), TX95 estimates are expected to rise about 7–9 times (from 5% in 1961–1990 to about 34–45% in 2046–2055). This is in good agreement with Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>–
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref> where, under the RCP 4.5 scenario, TX95 estimates computed from RCM simulations are expected to increase 5–10 times by mid century at locations close to the Equator.
