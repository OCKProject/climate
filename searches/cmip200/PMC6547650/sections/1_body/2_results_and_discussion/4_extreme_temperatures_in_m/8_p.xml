 </sup> that found that the mean temperature shift (ΔTXM) is the dominant factor (compared to a substantially weaker effect of the variability) for the increasing occurrence of hot extremes in many regions of the world. The shifts (ΔTXM), from 1961–1990 to 2046–2055, are also shown in the upper left corner of each plot in Fig.
