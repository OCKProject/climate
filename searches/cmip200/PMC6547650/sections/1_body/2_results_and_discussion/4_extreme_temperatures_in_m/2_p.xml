<p id="Par50" class="p">The dotted vertical line in each plot of Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref> indicates the 95th percentile of the DJF T
 <sub class="sub">MAX</sub> anomaly distribution corresponding to the base period 1961–1990. The interception of this vertical line with the histograms corresponding to the period 2046–2055 allows assessing the increases in extremely warm DJF days (TX95) projected by mid century.
