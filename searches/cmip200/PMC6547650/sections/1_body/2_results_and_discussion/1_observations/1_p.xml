 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> depicts the share of extremely warm DJF days (TX95) at nine locations, ranging from latitude 9°N (Mérida) to latitude 52°S (Rio Gallegos). TX95 values were computed: from quality-controlled temperature records over the period 1961–2016 (green dots), from historical RCM simulations over the period 1951–2005 (gray line), and from RCM projections over the period 2006–2100 (blue line for RCP4.5; red line for RCP8.5). In the case of the RCM-based estimates, thick lines indicate the multi model mean of TX95 estimates, while shadows stand for the dispersion bounds (based on the standard deviation computed by using the multi model spread of TX95 estimates).
