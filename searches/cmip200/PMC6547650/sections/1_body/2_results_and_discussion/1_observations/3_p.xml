<p id="Par32" class="p">As a reference, in the supplementary material (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref>) we have included the TX95 estimates over the period 2006–2015, computed from the 3 reanalysis datasets (CPC, NCEP-DOE Reanalysis 2, and ERAI). The TX95 estimates from different datasets exhibit significant differences: TX95 values from NCEP-DOE Reanalysis 2 (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4b</xref>) are lower in the eastern Amazon region and in southern SA than estimates from both CPC and ERAI datasets (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4a and c</xref>). Significant differences were also found in the case of the Atacama Desert (northern Chile/southern Peru) where ERAI-based TX95 estimates (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4c</xref>) were significantly higher that estimates based on other reanalysis datasets. The differences between TX95 estimates computed from different reanalysis datasets make unwise to use them for further comparisons.
