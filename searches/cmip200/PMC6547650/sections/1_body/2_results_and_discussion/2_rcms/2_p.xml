<p id="Par34" class="p">The quality-controlled temperature records allowed us to test these historical RCM simulations. In general over the period 1961–2005, we found a good agreement between TX95 values computed from observations (green dots in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>) and from historical RCM simulations (grey curves in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). This agreement becomes apparent when comparing decadal averages as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S5</xref>. An exception was detected in the case of Reconquista (northern Argentina; see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2e</xref> and Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S5e</xref>), where TX95 values computed from observations have been significantly below RCM-based estimates in recent decades.
