<p id="Par36" class="p">As expected, TX95 projections under the RCP8.5 scenario show larger increases. By the end of the century, TX95 estimates are projected to reach almost 100% in northern SA (see red lines in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a–c</xref>), and more than 80% in the Atacama Desert (Iquique) (see red line in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2d</xref>). The number of extremely warm days would also increase at higher latitudes under the RCP8.5 scenario but less significantly; TX95 estimates are expected to range from 20% to 40% by the end of the century in the case of locations at latitudes higher than 20°S (Reconquista, Santiago, Buenos Aires, Puerto Montt, and Rio Gallegos) (see red lines in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2e–i</xref>).
