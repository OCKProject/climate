<p id="Par35" class="p">RCM simulations were also used to project TX95 estimates according to two representative concentration pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). RCM-based estimates over the period 2006–2100 in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> show that the share of extremely warm days is expected to increase considerably, especially close to the equator (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a–c</xref>). According to the RCP4.5 scenario, TX95 estimates will reach about 50% by midcentury in Mérida and San Fernando and even higher values in Rochambeau (see blue lines in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a–c</xref>). Iquique (in the Atacama Desert) is below these values with a TX95 estimate of about 35% under the RCP4.5 scenario by midcentury (see blue line in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2d</xref>). Increments in extremely warm days are significantly lower at higher latitudes under the RCP4.5 scenario such that by midcentury, TX95 values lower than 15% are expected in the case of Reconquista, Santiago, Buenos Aires, Puerto Montt, and Rio Gallegos (see blue lines in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2e–i</xref>).
