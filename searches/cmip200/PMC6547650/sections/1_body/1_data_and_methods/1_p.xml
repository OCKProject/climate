<p id="Par11" class="p">In this study a HW is defined as a period of at least 3 consecutive days with the daily maximum temperatures (T
 <sub class="sub">MAX</sub>) exceeding a defined threshold during the considered season (DJF). The threshold was calculated at each location (or grid point of a climate model) by using the 95th percentile of the daily T
 <sub class="sub">MAX</sub> anomaly distribution over a base period. The 95th percentile was used to account for more severe events since prior efforts have shown that extremely warm days (those exceeding the 95th percentile of the daily maximum temperature) can substantially increase mortality and morbidity rates
