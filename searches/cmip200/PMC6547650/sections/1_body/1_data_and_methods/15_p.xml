 <sub class="sub">MAX</sub> data provided by the CMIP5 GCMs mentioned above were also analyzed. For consistency, we used the ensembles of the GCMs (see Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>) that drove the RCMs considered in this study. However, we also explored the effects on our GCM-based results of selecting different ensemble members. In particular, we compared TX95 estimates computed over the period 2046–2055 by using simulations rendered by several ensemble members corresponding to the following GCMs: EC-EARTH (9 ensembles), CSIRO-Mk3-6-0 (9 ensembles), and CanESM2 (5 ensembles). We did not find significant differences between TX95 estimates based on different ensemble members (see Figs 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>–
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>), which suggests that the selection of a specific ensemble member does not substantially affect our outcomes.
