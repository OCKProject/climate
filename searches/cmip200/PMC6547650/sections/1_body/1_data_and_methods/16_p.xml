 </sup>, in this study our projections are based on the multi model mean (MMM) of HW metrics and of TX95 values, previously computed for each selected model separately (either GCM or RCM). Moreover, note that although we used a fair number of GCMs, we also explored the possibility of including additional GCMs. In this regard, the MMM computed by using the GCMs in TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref> was compared with the MMM obtained by adding other available GCMs. We did not find significant changes in the MMM.
