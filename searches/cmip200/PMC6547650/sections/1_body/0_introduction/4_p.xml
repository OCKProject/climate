<p id="Par5" class="p">At a global scale, the study of the characteristics (intensity, frequency and duration) of future HWs has been addressed by using simulated scenarios from the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). Perkins-Kirkpatrick &amp; Gibson

 </sup> found an increase in HW days (between 4–34 extra days per season) per degree Celsius of global warming. Limiting global warming to the lower Paris Agreement target of 1.5 °C brings along substantial positive effects and benefits

 </sup>. In fact, stabilizing climate warming at 1.5 °C would decrease extreme heat-related mortality by 15–22% per summer in key European cities compared with stabilization at 2 °C

 </sup>. Similarly, if warming is limited to 1.5 °C instead of 2 °C, the probability of HW events like those in southern Africa (1991/1992) and in northern Africa (2009/2010) could be reduced by about 25% and 20%, respectively
