<p id="Par10" class="p">We found that in recent decades the share of extremely warm DJF days has at least doubled in northern SA; less significant increases have been observed in southern SA. We also found that by midcentury, under the RCP4.5 scenario, extremely warm DJF days (as well as the number of HWs per season) are expected to increase 5â€“10 times at locations close to the Equator and in the Atacama Desert. Increments are expected to be less pronounced in southern SA. Projections under the RCP8.5 scenario point toward even larger disruptions in the HWs metrics, particularly in tropical areas. Methodological details are provided below.</p>
