<p id="Par8" class="p">Building on these prior efforts, in this study we have assessed the progression and expected changes in four HW metrics (HW duration, HW frequency, HW amplitude, and number of HWs per season), as well as the share of extremely warm days over the period December-January-February (DJF). We considered as extremely warm days those that exceeded the 95th percentile of the daily maximum temperature anomaly distribution over a base period, while a HW was defined as a time span of at least 3 consecutive extremely warm days.</p>
