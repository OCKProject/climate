 </sup>. An increasing threat to human life from HWs seems almost inevitable since, even if drastic reductions in emission of greenhouse gases (GHG) are enforced, the percentage of the world’s population exposed to a dangerous heat and humidity combination (for at least 20 days a year) will increase from about 30% nowadays to around 48% by 2100
