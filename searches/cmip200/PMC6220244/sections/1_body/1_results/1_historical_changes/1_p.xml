 </sup> contribution to streamflow in the range of 4 to 61%, in which ice melt alone contributed from 1 to 22% for the ten major rivers. As part of the glacial runoff, the catchment ice-melt contributions varied between 30 and 55% with a mean of 48% over the TPK river basins. The modelled variations between rivers are principally due to differences in upstream glacier coverage and in climate (see Table Sm1). On the eastern slope EWG, ETL, EKG, and ETR river basins, which are heavily glacierized, the glacial-runoff contribution to annual streamflow ranges between 40 and 61%, while the ice melt contributes 19 to 22%. Glaciers in this region are usually located in high elevation headwater sub-basins so that the glacial-runoff and ice-melt contribution ratios decrease as the river progresses downstream

 </sup>. For example, in the WAM on the western slope, the glaciers are concentrated in the Pyanj and Vakhsh tributary sub-basins, where the glacier-runoff contribution to the annual streamflow of the whole basin represents less than 13%, and the ice-melt contribution 7%.
