<p id="Par7" class="p">Long-term trajetories of glacier runoff components, ice melt runoff and supraglacial components (snow melt and rainfall runoff on ice) were compared (see Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>). Ice melt is simulated to reach a maximum in the middle of the twenty-first century under both RCP2.6 and RCP4.5. Under RCP8.5, ice melt is projected to increase continuously to 2100 for the heavily glacierized basins EWG, WTL, and ETR. In contrast, total glacial runoff is found to decline until the late twenty-first century in all the ten rivers except for the ETL, EWG and ETR. In the most heavily glacierized eastern slope basins, the EWG, ETL, and ETR (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>), changes in ice melt dominate changes in glacial runoff. In other less glacierized western slope basins, declining supraglacial snowmelt explains most of the decreasing trend of total glacial runoff. In WIL, WSY, and WAM in the western slope, and the less glacierized EJG and EKD in the eastern slope, in the first half of the twenty-first century, supraglacial snowmelt dominates the glacial runoff trend, even where ice melt and the supraglacial component have opposite trends. During the late twenty-first century, ice melt drops below its historical level in most of the basins except for the initially heavily glacierized EWG, ETL, and ETR (see Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>). Most recently, Huss and Hock projected the global glacier runoff changes until 2100

 </sup>. They indicated that in the glacier fed Aral Sea (Amu and Syr) and Tarim rivers, annual glacier runoff is projected to rise until roughly the middle of the century, followed by steadily declining glacier runoff thereafter under RCP 4.5. For the Tarim River, the projected long-term patterns are compatible. However, for the WAM and WSY, we projected that the turning points have already passed (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). The difference might be due to the different climate and glacier runoff models that were used in our studies, which imply that the uncertainties caused by climate and glacier runoff models are significant issues to be addressed.
