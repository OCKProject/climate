 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3e</xref> describes the projected glacier ratios in 2095 under RCPs 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5. It is also found that the ice melt to streamflow ratios (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3d</xref>) and changes in streamflow (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a–c</xref>) are closely related to the glacier ratios (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3e</xref>) in the major rivers. For higher glacier ratio, the varation ranges is wider, which indicates more sensitive to warming temperature. Meanwhile, the higher the glacier ratio is, the more the ice melt will contribute to the streamflow, and the more likely streamflow will increase.
