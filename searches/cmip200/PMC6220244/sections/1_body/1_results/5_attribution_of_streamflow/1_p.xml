<p id="Par11" class="p">By comparing long-term changes in the water balance components, i.e., precipitation, change in ice storage, and evapotranspiration (see Supplementary Information), we found that increasing ice melt and precipitation are the dominant reasons for streamflow increase in rivers on the eastern slope. In the heavily glacierized basins of the EWG, ETL, and ETR, where today’s glacier coverage is above 5% and ice melt makes up over 13% of the streamflow, the future increase in streamflow is dominated by loss of ice-water storage (see Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref>). In the less glacierized basins of the EKD, the streamflow increase is attributed to higher precipitation. In the moderately glacier-covered EJG basins, both ice melt and precipitation support the increased streamflow. On the other hand, on the western slope, ice melt contributes only marginally to streamflow (see Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3d</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref>) and increasing evapotranspiration and decreasing precipitation are the main causes of streamflow decline in the WCH, WSY and WAM river catchments (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref>).
