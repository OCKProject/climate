<p id="Par9" class="p">As a result of changes in glacial runoff and changes in precipitation in the non-glacierized parts of each catchment, streamflow is projected to increase in eastern slope rivers (and in WIL), but to decrease in western slope rivers between 1966–1995 and 2066–2095. For RCP2.6, streamflow increases in eastern slope catchments by 8% (−3 to 20%, climate model variation, CMV) between 1966–1995 and 2066–2095; for RCP8.5, streamflow also increases by 28% (9 to 44%, CMV), with ice melt contributing 39% (25 to 65%, CMV) of this signal. Taking into account the range of future uncertainties resulting from climate models and scenario differences, the streamflow in the Xinjiang rivers is

 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>
 </sup> (94% probability) to increase in 2066–2095 (see Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref>). For the western slope rivers WAM, WSY, and WCH delivering water to Central Asian countries, the streamflow is set to decrease by an average of 1% (−9 to 7%, CMV) under RCP2.6 and by 5% (−24 to 16%, CMV) under RCP8.5 between 1966–1995 and 2066–2095, respectively (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). The streamflow in the Central Asian rivers is
