<p id="Par13" class="p">Changes in hydrographs due to snowmelt, ice melt, and streamflow are more apparent for rivers on western slopes than on eastern ones (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S5</xref>). The snowmelt seasonal contribution to hydrographs shows a change in peak timing and values, but no obvious shift in the ice melt seasonal contribution is seen under the warming climate (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S5</xref>). With steadily increasing temperature during the twenty-first century, snowmelt seasonal hydrographs shift earlier for all the 10 rivers studied; by ~10 days in 2016–2045 and 11 to 32 days in 2066–2095 depending on the RCP considered, relative to 1966–1995. No obvious seasonal shift of streamflow hydrographs is projected for eastern slope rivers but a shift towards earlier maximum streamflow on the western slope is found, by 18 days in 2016–2045 and by 42 days in 2066–2095 under RCP8.5 (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). High-flow volume increases were noted over three months (June–August) for highly glacierized basins on the eastern slope. However, in the western slope rivers, a reduction can be seen, by 15 to 21% under RCP8.5 in 2066–2095. Ice melt stabilizes the peak flow timing on the one hand, but causes an increasing high-flow volume on the other when ice-melt contribution is more than 13%. However, when the ice-melt contribution is below 13%, there is a detectible advance in peak timing and a negative change in maximum streamflow values (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>).
