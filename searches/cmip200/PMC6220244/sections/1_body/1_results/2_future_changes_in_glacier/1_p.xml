<p id="Par6" class="p">The model estimated that in the future both glacier area and ice-water storage will decline significantly, yet with regional differences. Relative to the 1960s under the low-warming scenario RCP2.6, between 36 and 55% (mean 52%) of the glacier area is projected to disappear by 2045 in the western slope basins, compared to 19 to 59% (mean 26%) loss for the eastern slope. Among all the scenarios, RCP2.6 projects the smallest increase in temperature; however, the TPK glacier area will continue to decrease in the twenty-first century, especially in its second half, indicating that glacier retreat will be a general trend under atmospheric warming in the future. Under the high and continuous warming scenario of RCP8.5, the glacier-area loss is similar to RCP2.6 by 2045, given the small differences in temperature and precipitation at that time between both scenarios

 </sup>. However by 2095 under RCP8.5 coupled with continued global increases in greenhouse gases and temperatures, the mean glacier-area loss will become larger than in RCP2.6, with a 70 to 81% (mean 79%) loss on the western slope, and 52 to 93% (mean 59%) on the eastern slope. Meanwhile, in the RCP8.5 climate scenario, by 2095, relative to the 1960s, the loss of ice-water storage ranges between 46 and 94% (mean 54%) on the eastern slope and 64 to 68% (mean 65%) on the western slope; in two river basins, EKD in the eastern slope and WCH in the western slope, most of the glaciers will have disappeared. Glaciers decrease less on the eastern slope because they experience a larger increase in precipitation, and because their average size is greater, they are less vulnerable to warming. Details of projected glacier changes are presented in Fig.
