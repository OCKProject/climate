 </sup> to simulate glacier processes and dynamics. The model is suitable for the analysis of large river basins. The GHRU approach explicitly simulates glacier mass balance and transient area–volume dynamics interactively on a time-step of one day. Each GHRU is divided into 100 m elevation bands, to account for spatial variation in precipitation and temperature over the altitudinal range. Glacier mass balance is simulated for each elevation band. The mass-balance components included are: the accumulation of snow, transformation of snow to ice, sublimation/evaporation, melting and refreezing. In the model, supraglacial snowmelt is calculated first, and then ice melt if the snow disappears leaving ice exposed to air temperature. The model neglects the effects of debris-cover found on some glaciers. Both snowmelt and ice melt were calculated using degree-day factors. Rain falling on to ice is assumed to run off directly as “runoff of rainfall over ice”. A volume-area scaling relationship was used to simulate the transient change of glacier area and volume, updated by ice mass changes. In contrast to other glacio-hydrological models that lump glaciers and glacier patches in an individual grid square into a single virtual glacier

 </sup>, the GHRU approach simulates individual glaciers and therefore can capture the different transient climate-change responses of glaciers of different sizes. Glacial runoff was separated into ice melt, supraglacial snowmelt, and runoff of rainfall over ice.
