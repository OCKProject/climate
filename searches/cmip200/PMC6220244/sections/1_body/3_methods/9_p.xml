<p id="Par26" class="p">Comparing changes of the water balance components averaged over 2016–2045 and 2066–2095 to that over 1966–1995, we identified the patterns of hydrological variables and the reasons for streamflow changes over the long term. Further details of the methods used are given in the Supplementary Information.</p>
