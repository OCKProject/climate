<p id="Par24" class="p">Annual catchment water balances included the input precipitation, the outputs of evapotranspiration and streamflow at the outlet, and the storage changes in ice, soil moisture, and groundwater. The simulation results indicated that the annual storage changes of soil moisture and groundwater over the long term are negligible. Thus the storage-change terms reduce to ice change only.</p>
