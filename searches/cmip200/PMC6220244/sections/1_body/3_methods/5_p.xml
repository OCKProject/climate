<p id="Par22" class="p">The glacier-enhanced SWAT model was calibrated and validated using daily or monthly streamflow records from 55 gauging stations and the basin-wide glacier-area change in the Manas, Kaidu, Weigan, Tailan, Kashgar and Tarim basins on the eastern slope, and the Ili, Chu, Syr and Amu basins on the western slope of the TPK mountain complex (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>), which shows that the model reproduces the observed streamflow and basin-scale glacier changes reliably.
