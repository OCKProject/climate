 <italic class="italic">PET</italic>, and we used the Hargreaves (H-G) method

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>
 </sup>. The H-G method is temperature based, i.e., it needs only the daily maximum, minimum, and mean temperatures as input. Meanwhile, it takes into account of effect of solar radiation on 
 <italic class="italic">PET</italic> by inclusion of the extraterrestrial radiation. The extraterrestrial radiation depends only upon solar declination, geographic latitude, and the angular velocity of earth’s rotation. There is not any parameter in the H-G method that needs calibration and validation based on historical data series, while the historically based parameter might not be suitable for future climate as discussed in literatures
