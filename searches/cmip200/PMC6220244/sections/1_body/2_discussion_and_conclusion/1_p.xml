<p id="Par14" class="p">In the contiguous region of the TPK, ranging from the south slope of Karakoram to Himalaya, runoff in the twenty-first century is expected to increase consistently due to increasing glacier melt and precipitation until the 2050s

 </sup>. In some of the TPK tributary catchments, the streamflow is projected to increase until the 2020â€‰s but then begins to decline until the end of the twenty-first century

 </sup>. It is worth noting that this study projects similar long-term trend patterns of melt water and streamflow in those tributary catchments, but with later turning points and slower decline in glacier area, melt, and streamflow up to the end of the twenty-first century. This projected behavior is possibly due to uncertainties caused by the glacial melt modelling approach and the GCM scenarios.
