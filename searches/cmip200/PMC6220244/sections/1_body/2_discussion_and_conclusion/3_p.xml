<p id="Par16" class="p">Evapotranspiration is another important water balance component which might be a source of uncertainties. It depends upon inputs of the historical and future climate, and the theoretical approaches (see Supplementary Information). However, evapotranspiration is perhaps a grayer zone than other water balance items in the alpine hydrology due to data scarcity in data for input and for output evaluation of the theoretical approaches.</p>
