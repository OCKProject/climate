<p id="Par15" class="p">As most of the similar studies in the high mountain regions, scarcity of the ground-based climatic data is always an important issue to deal with. Different proxy data base may be used to drive the simulation. Uncertainty caused by the precipitation data remains an unaddressed issue. Andermann

 </sup>. They also indicated that the lack of stations at high elevation limits the accuracy of this data set; more ground-based observations could allow for better conclusions drawn from any atmospheric-related studies in the Hymalas region; this might be also correct for the Tien Shan – Pamir – Karakoram Range.
