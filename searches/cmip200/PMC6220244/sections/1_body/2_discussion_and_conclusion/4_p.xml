<p id="Par17" class="p">In summary, glacier mass loss in response to climate change will lead to contrasting water supply situations for the downstream users of TPK water resources. The increase in water supply on the eastern slope will favour water users downstream in Xinjiang during the next decades, albeit with a significant loss of ice. This extra water may provide an opportunity to restore the degraded riparian forest ecosystems, e.g., the

 </sup>. However, the fact that streamflow will not increase, or will more likely decrease, in the WCH, WSY and WAM rivers indicates that human use of water should not exceed current levels if we are to avoid risks of trans-boundary water disputes between Central Asian countries. Earlier shifts in the streamflow hydrographs and reduction of the high-flow volume in the WSY and WAM rivers also implies that water regulations should be improved in Central Asian countries, to allow hydropower generation in upper-reach countries (Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan) and summer irrigation in the lower-reach countries (Uzbekistan, Kazkhakstan, and Turkumenistan)
