 </sup>, there is a lack of integrated assessment of the impacts of climate change on the future evolution of the TPK glaciers and their consequences for river discharge. One difficulty in assessing river discharge in this region is the unknown future behavior of glacial runoff, which is considered in this study as the sum of ice melt, snowmelt and the runoff of rainfall over ice
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>
 </sup>. These three processes have distinctly different responses to climate change. Ice melt has a long-term response to climate change, while the supraglacial snowmelt and rainfall runoff over ice have much faster changes than it. Because ice melt is difficult to measure directly for a larger area
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>
 </sup>, we used an glacier - enhanced SWAT (Soil Water and Assessment Tool) model
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>
 </sup> to simulate it. This model (see Supplementary Information) describes glaciers as hydrological response units (GHRUs) and calculates ice melt based on glacier mass balance and an area-volume scaling relationship

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">28</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">29</xref>
 </sup>. A GHRU is divided into elevation bands of equal intervals, and the mass balance of a glacier is the sum of the balance of each band. It also calculates the supraglacial snowmelt and the runoff of rainfall over ice components of glacial runoff. The GHRU approach has been incorporated into the distributed Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT)

 </sup> to simulate catchment hydrological changes. We calibrated and validated the combined glacier-hydrology model using daily (in Xinjiang basins) and monthly (in Central Asian basins) streamflow records from 55 gauging stations (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">Sm2</xref>) and observed glacier area change. We tested (see Supplementary Information) the ability of the model to reproduce observed streamflow changes from 1961 to 2007 and basin-scale glacier changes between the 2000s and the 1960s, forced by precipitation from APHRODITE (the Asian Precipitation – Highly Resolved Observational Data Integration Towards Evaluation of Water Resources Data Integration

 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>
 </sup>). For the simulated and observed monthly streamflow of those ten rivers, the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency criterion

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">34</xref>
 </sup> varies between 0.33 and 0.94 with a mean of 0.79 and standard deviation (SD) of 0.11; the relative bias ranges between −30 and 23% with a mean of 2% and SD of 9%; the coefficient of determination of a linear regression between observed and modelled discharge over the gauged period 1961–2007 ranges from 0.77–0.94, with a mean of 0.87 and SD of 0.06 in the ten studied rivers. Linear regression between the simulated and observed glacier area change has a correlation coefficient of 0.97 with a coefficient of determination of 0.91 and zero intercept for the ten basins considered (see Figs

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">Sm5</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">Sm6</xref> in Supplementary Information: modelling and data). These results suggest that the glacio-hydrological model parameterizations are sufficiently realistic to allow use of the model to investigate future changes. Hydrological changes were projected to 2100 using CMIP5 climate models (a total of 16 models involved) outputs under the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5 climate scenarios. The word “pathway” was nice shorthand coined by the developers of the RCP concept, meaning time series of anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentration. The different RCP represents different pathway that may lead to a target radiation forcing till 2100
