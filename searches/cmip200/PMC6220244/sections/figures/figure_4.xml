  <p class="p">Shift towards earlier peak in seasonal river flow (upper panel) and changes in the amplitude of maximum flow (average of the three months with highest values, lower panel). Values are plotted against the ratio of annual ice melt to streamflow averaged over 2066–2095, between historical (1966–1995) and future (2066–2095) conditions for the TPK rivers. XC, for rivers delivering water to Xinjiang, China; CA: for rivers to Central Asian countries.</p>
