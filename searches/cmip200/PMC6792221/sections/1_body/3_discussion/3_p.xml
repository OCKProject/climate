<p id="Par36" class="p">Mean temperature of the warmest quarter is probably relevant because 
 <italic class="italic">M. spinolai</italic> inhabits areas with marked seasonality that affects this ectothermic species, forcing reproduction during the warm season [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" class="xref">71</xref>]. Temperature is related to triatomine dispersal to locate hosts and mates, and diapause induction [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">47</xref>]. The maximum suitability for this variable was at 24 °C; however, under 10 °C and above 24 °C, suitability drops abruptly. The suitability maps for

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">34</xref>] are quite similar to ours for
