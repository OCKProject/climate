<p id="Par35" class="p">The SDM built for 
 <italic class="italic">M. spinolai</italic> was mainly associated with annual precipitation (Bio12) and mean temperature of the warmest quarter (Bio10), both contributing with more than 90% in the model. Precipitation above 400 mm decreased its occurrence probability, with the maximum suitability values about 100 mm. High rainfall might be creating an excessively humid microenvironment promoting entomopathogenic fungus growth [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" class="xref">68</xref>]; therefore, this would probably decrease vector fitness. On the other hand, moderate precipitation may be indirectly related to the presence of 
 <italic class="italic">M. spinolai</italic>, because rainfall promotes primary productivity (i.e. plant communities) and this, in turn, positively affects the abundance of small rodent species such as 
 <italic class="italic">Octodon degus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Phyllotis darwini</italic>, hosts of 
 <italic class="italic">M. spinolai</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" class="xref">69</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70" class="xref">70</xref>]. Then, the increase in host populations would have a positive effect on vector population demographic parameters.
