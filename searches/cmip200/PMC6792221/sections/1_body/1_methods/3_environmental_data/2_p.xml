<p id="Par19" class="p">Based on the hypothesis of accessible areas by dispersal over relevant time periods (M, hereafter) for both 
 <italic class="italic">Mepraia</italic> species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">45</xref>], we set 2° (~222 km) buffer areas around each occurrence. The genus 
 <italic class="italic">Mepraia</italic> is a dispersal restricted group, given that most developmental stages disperse by walking, unlike winged males that can also fly [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">43</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">46</xref>]; therefore, the accessible areas used were conservative compared to previous reports [e.g. 35, 37]. This buffer was constrained by the Andes and the Pacific Ocean, which constitute geomorphological features that 
 <italic class="italic">Mepraia</italic> species would not naturally overcome [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref>]. These areas were used to extract the background data for modelling each species niche (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). We analysed the correlation among the selected variables within these calibration areas using 10,000 random points plus occurrences in R project v.3.4.1 (
 <italic class="italic">Stats</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">corrplot</italic> packages) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">47</xref>].
