   <bold class="bold">Climatology of observed historical water temperature (Obs) in the reference period (1961–1990) and the projected future water temperature (red and blue lines) in the prediction period (2070–2099).</bold> The grey line is at 9°C and represents the temperature at which crabs will commence overwintering. Both the conservative estimate of the increase in water temperature (Extended Trend, red line) and the projected water temperature from the multi-model enseble of downscaled GCM models (Downscaled GCM, blue line) predict the average year in the prediction period will be warmer than the average year in the reference period.
