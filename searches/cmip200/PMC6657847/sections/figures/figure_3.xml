   <bold class="bold">Length of crab overwintering period (top panel; expressed as the number of days below 9Â°C in a given year) and probability of overwinter survival (bottom panel) for observational data (black dots) and projected data from two sources (conservative estimate (Extended Trend) in red and a multi-model ensemble of downscaled GCM data (Downscaled GCM) in blue).</bold> The year 1977 was excluded from the analysis due to large gaps in the observational data for that year. Error bands for projections represent one standard deviation.
