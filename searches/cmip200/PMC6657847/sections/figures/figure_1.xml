  <title class="title">Schematic of the utilization of the transfer function to predict the length of the overwintering period and the winter survival of blue crab through the year 2100.</title>
  <p class="p">Daily projected air temperature was accessed from two sources: a conservative extension of the observational trend of increasing water temperature in the historical data (left side of figure) and a multi-model ensemble of downscaled CGM projections (right side of figure). The projected air temperature time series were used with the transfer function to predict future water temperature based on those two data sources. The number of days below 9Â°C for each source of future temperature data was used as a proxy for the overwintering period of crabs under both the conservative (extension of the observational data trend) and the downscaled GCM warming scenarios. The mean temperature during the overwintering period was used in conjunction with the length of the overwintering period to predict the probability of overwinter survival for each warming scenario.</p>
