<p class="p">The goal of this study was to use a multi-model ensemble of regional, downscaled GCM temperature projections to explore how changes in water temperature may impact the overwintering behavior and winter survival of blue crab in the Chesapeake Bay. To achieve this goal, we accessed a long-term (1938â€“2016) dataset of daily water and air temperature measurements collected in the Patuxent River. These temperature data were fit to a harmonic regression model that yielded a transfer function which was used to estimate water temperature from air temperature [

This transfer function was then applied to two sources of climate projections, chosen to characterize a conservative estimate represented by an extension of the temperature trend in the long-term dataset, and downscaled climate model-based estimates of a relatively high greenhouse gas emissions future (RCP8.5[
