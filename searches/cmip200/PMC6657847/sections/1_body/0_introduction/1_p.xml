<p class="p">Dormancy is a life history strategy employed by a variety of species to survive periods of environmental hardship and can be initiated by external cues or by an internal physiological response [

 <xref rid="pone.0219555.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Environmental variability within a species’ range may cause interannual variability in the proportion of the population undergoing dormancy and overwinter survival rates [

 <xref rid="pone.0219555.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. The blue crab, 
 <italic class="italic">Callinectes sapidus</italic>, is an ecologically and economically valuable marine crustacean that is found in coastal areas of the western Atlantic and the Caribbean from Argentina to New England [
 <xref rid="pone.0219555.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0219555.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Like all crustaceans, blue crab grow by molting, which involves rapid increases in size associated with the shedding of the external carapace (growth per molt) followed by periods of stasis (intermolt period). Previous research has shown that the intermolt period, but not growth per molt, is temperature-dependent [
 <xref rid="pone.0219555.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0219555.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Therefore, growth rate and consequently key life history events such as maturation, are determined by the external temperature [
 <xref rid="pone.0219555.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. The critical temperature for growth in blue crab is approximately 9°C, below which metabolic rates decline and dormancy is induced, referred to as overwintering in this species [
 <xref rid="pone.0219555.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0219555.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. As a result of these specific temperature-dependencies, the latitudinal temperature gradient present throughout the blue crab range creates predictable variability in stage duration, growth rates and the likelihood of winter dormancy [
 <xref rid="pone.0219555.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0219555.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. Moreover, the intensity and duration of overwintering behavior has been directly linked the winter survival of blue crab [
 <xref rid="pone.0219555.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>] and therefore changes to overwintering behavior may affect blue crab population dynamics and geographic distribution. Understanding how current warming trends will affect the survival and life history of marine species is critical to effectively managing these ecosystems in the face of a changing climate.
