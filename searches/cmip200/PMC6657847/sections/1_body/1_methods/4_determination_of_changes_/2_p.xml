<p class="p">Changes in the length of the overwintering period with year were examined using linear regression. The length of the overwintering period predicted by the extended data was compared to the length of the overwintering period predicted by the downscaled GCM data in four time intervals (2017–2030, 2031–2050, 2051–2070, 2071–2100) using a t-test.</p>
