<p class="p">The total number of days when water temperature was projected to be below the critical temperature for growth, (9°C; [
 <xref rid="pone.0219555.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]) was determined for the two sources of time series of projected water temperature (extended data and downscaled GCM). The number of days below 9°C represents the length of the overwintering period of crab in any given year and is defined as the length of winter in this study. Winter years were determined as the bridge of calendar years (e.g.: winter 1990–1991 was recorded as winter 1990) since wintertime temperatures occur between calendar years in the Chesapeake Bay. Due to the increase in year length during leap years, the length of winter was often one day longer than would be expected during these years. This is evident in the oscillations present in the predicted length of winter and overwinter survival (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec008" class="xref">Results</xref>), and represent a calculated increase in winter length and concurrent decrease in overwinter survival during those years, despite the stability of the actual orbital parameters controlling winter.
