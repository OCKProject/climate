<p class="p">Harmonic models were developed to characterize the seasonal cycle of air and water temperature known to exist in mid-latitude estuaries following the methods of Cho and Lee [

 <xref rid="pone.0219555.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>] and are only summarized here. The multistep approach includes both calibration (C) and validation (V) phases. In the calibration phase, 30% of the observations, drawn at random from the entire dataset, are used to fit harmonic models to express air temperature and water temperature as a function of Julian day. The parameter estimates from the air and water calibration temperature models are subsequently validated using the 70% of the data not included in the original model fit. The parameters from the validated models are then combined in a transfer function that predicts water temperature from air temperature. A final model is developed to predict future water temperature using new linear and harmonic coefficients based on the entire observational dataset. The performance of the final model is evaluated by comparing the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the validation model to the RMSE of the final model.
