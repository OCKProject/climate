<p class="p">Uncertainties in forecasted temperatures were calculated differently for the extended data and the downscaled GCM projections. For the extended data, we resampled regression parameters from a normal distribution defined by the mean and standard deviation (SD) of the original parameter estimate, generating 50 new forecasted temperature projections. This created 50 separate projected temperature time series, and we subsequently calculated the daily mean (± SD) temperature of the projected time series. For the downscaled GCM projections, we carried forward the projections of air temperature from each of the 41 individual ensemble members and then calculated mean (±SD) daily temperature.</p>
