<p class="p">The transfer function (
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0219555.e001" class="xref">Eq 1</xref>) was used to predict daily future water temperature under two assumptions regarding future climate: extension of the trend in observational air temperature data (extended data) and a multi-model ensemble of downscaled GCM air temperature data (downscaled GCM) from model runs forced with Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5). The least squares parameter estimates of the transfer function were used directly to extend patterns in the observed data from 2016â€“2100. The downscaled GCM data [

Daily minimum and maximum 1/8 degree resolution data from 3 grid boxes along the US east coast near Solomons were downloaded for January 1950-December 2099 and averaged to create a single daily observation of air temperature.
