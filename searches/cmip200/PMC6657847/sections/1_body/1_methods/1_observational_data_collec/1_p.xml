<p class="p">Air and water temperatures have been observed since 1938 at the end of a 274 meter long pier located at the Chesapeake Biological Laboratory (CBL), Solomons, MD (38.3185° N, 76.4541° W). Observations were taken manually at noon using a research-grade mercury thermometer from 1938–2012. From 2012 to 2016, water temperatures were recorded every 15 minutes via a calibrated YSI EX02 multi-parameter sonde (Yellow Springs Instruments, Inc., Yellow Springs, OH)., and air temperature data were recorded every 15 minutes via Davis Vantage Pro 2 (model 6152) meteorological station (Davis Instruments, Haywood, CA). Although this 72-year time series is largely complete, missing values were replaced with nearby (co-located or &lt;2 nautical miles) observational data from the Chesapeake Bay Program (CBP) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) buoy system. Missing values in CBL air temperature data were filled in using data from NOAA buoys at Cove Point (buoy number 8577018, COVM2) and Solomons (buoy number 8577330, SLIM2) and missing values in CBL water temperature were filled in using data from CBP water quality stations LE1.3 and LE1.4 and NOAA Solomons buoy (buoy number 8577330, SLIM2). Major axis regression of the CBL data with all other sources indicated a high degree of similarity between data sources (Slope&gt;0.94, R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>&gt;0.95, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>&lt;0.01 for all regressions). Gaps in the combined historical sea surface temperature time series, primarily due to no data collection over weekends and holidays, were filled in by linear interpolation because water temperatures do not often change substantially over the course of a few days due to the high specific heat of water. This was tested by an autocorrelation analysis of the daily data, which demonstrated a temporal decorrelation scale of 91 days. The average gap length in the air temperature time series was 10 days and the longest gap was 20 days. The average gap length in the water temperature time series was 9 days and the longest gap was 17 days. The filled gaps represented 15.6% and 12.4% of the total CBL air and water temperature time series, respectively. The observational data used in this study are available in
