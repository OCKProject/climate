<p class="p">Our analyses focused on the juvenile life stage of blue crab due to its importance in regulating overall population dynamics in the Chesapeake Bay [
 <xref rid="pone.0219555.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. However, crab size has also been shown to be a significant driver of winter survival rates [
 <xref rid="pone.0219555.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Under current conditions, larger crabs have a significant survival advantage in the wintertime over their smaller counterparts. However, this advantage may not be as impactful as winter temperatures, and therefore crab survival rates across crab sizes, continue to rise, and could be manifested as a decline in average size at maturity, which has been observed in previous studies on blue crab [
 <xref rid="pone.0219555.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. Additionally, increased temperatures have been associated with declines in fecundity in blue crab [
 <xref rid="pone.0219555.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>] as well as changes to the timing of spawning and consequently larval distributions, with implications of mismatched food resources for early hatching larvae. The tradeoff between potential increases in maturation rates and possible declines in fecundity or mismatches in larval food availability are critical to understanding the overall effect of climate change on this species. From a fisheries perspective, understanding how our predictions at the juvenile life stage would play out throughout the ontogeny of blue crab in this system is also an important area of future research.
