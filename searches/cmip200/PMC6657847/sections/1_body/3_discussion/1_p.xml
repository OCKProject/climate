<p class="p">Our analysis of historical and future predicted temperatures indicates that water temperatures will continue to rise in the Chesapeake Bay through the year 2100. This increase in water temperature will occur equally in all seasons of the year, and will therefore effect blue crab wintertime behavior and survival. The projected increases in water temperature will result in a significant shortening of the overwintering period of blue crab in the Chesapeake Bay. We predict that the shortening of winter combined with increases in average wintertime temperatures will cause a significant increase in blue crab winter survival. The concurrent decline in winter length and increase in winter survival has the potential to significantly change the biology of blue crab in the Chesapeake Bay.</p>
