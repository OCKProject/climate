 <xref rid="pone.0219555.ref044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>], our analyses underscore the importance of adaptive management in order to mitigate the effects of increasing temperatures on commercially important species. Despite the significant decrease overwintering period length and a significant increase in overwinter survival of blue crab under both the conservative and extreme warming scenarios tested in this study, the variability in the projections creates uncertainty around blue crab overwinter behavior and survival. Although estuarine species such as blue crab are adapted to live in variable environments, the effect of increases in environmental variability on blue crab physiology are not yet know. Additionally, environmental parameters will likely not respond to climate changes at equal rates–

The burden rests upon timely availability and interpretation of biological and environmental data in order to sustainably manage blue crab both ecologically and economically as temperatures and climate variability continue to increase through the next century.
