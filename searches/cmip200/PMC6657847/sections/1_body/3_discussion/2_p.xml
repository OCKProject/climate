<p class="p">To assess the potential impacts of the projected changes in wintertime length and severity on the Chesapeake Bay crab population, we compared present-day overwintering behavior in the Chesapeake Bay with crab populations from latitudes that are currently characterized by the projected future conditions for the Bay. The number of days below 9°C at various latitudes along the east coast of North America from 2012–2016 were estimated from the NOAA National Buoy Data Center and are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219555.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>. According to a regression of the number of days below 9°C and latitude, the number of days below 9°C in the year 2100 projected by the extended data is equivalent to the current number of days below 9°C in Newport News, Virginia and the number of days below 9°C in the year 2100 projected by the downscaled model data is equivalent to the current number of days below 9°C in Morehead City, North Carolina. Since the overwintering behavior of blue crab is a response to a seasonal decrease in environmental temperature [
 <xref rid="pone.0219555.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>], it is reasonable to assume that the future overwintering behavior of blue crab in Chesapeake Bay will change to resemble the behavior currently observed in the Sounds of North Carolina and further south as temperatures continue to warm. Assuming similar variability in the length of winter in the future as was observed in the past, the probability of crab overwintering in Maryland will decline and in some years individual crabs in this region may not overwinter at all. We infer from our analyses that blue crab overwintering behavior in the Maryland portion of the Chesapeake Bay will change from a pattern in which blue crab overwinter consistently to one in which overwintering of blue crab occurs inconsistently, sensitive to winter severity.
