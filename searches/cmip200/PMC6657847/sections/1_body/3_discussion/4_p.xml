The increase in energetic demands as a result of the predicted increase in the growing season combined with an increase in the vulnerability of crab prey in the more acidic water of the future may cause crab to target weaker prey items more heavily and could have ecosystem-wide effects. There is also evidence that the increased growth rates associated with increased temperature may come at a cost to blue crab carapace integrity [
 <xref rid="pone.0219555.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. In order to sustain increased growth rates when exposed to high temperature, the percent of high-magnesium calcite in the carapace declines, which has been associated with declines in carapace strength in other invertebrates [

The tradeoffs between the effects changes in temperature, acidity, and salinity underscore just some of the complexities involved in predicting the population level impacts of climate change, even on a single, well-studied species such as the blue crab.
