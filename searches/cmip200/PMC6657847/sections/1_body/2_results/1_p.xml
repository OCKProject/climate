<p class="p">Our analyses indicate that under the tested scenarios, future (2070–2100) water temperature in the Maryland portion of the Chesapeake Bay will increase from the 1961–1990 average of 15.2 ±8.9°C (standard deviation) to 17.6 ± 8.6°C extending the current trend, and to 19.2±8.6°C using the downscaled-models multi-model ensemble average. The temperature seasonality of an average year in the reference interval (1961–1990) compared to an average year in the prediction interval (2070–2099) under both future temperature scenarios is shown in

The length of the overwintering period in the long-term observational data ranged from 145 days in 1943 to 75 days in 2012, with an average length of 117±16 days. Using an empirically determined, temperature dependent survival function [
 <xref rid="pone.0219555.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>], the probability of overwinter survival in the observational data ranged from 0.44 in 1940 to 0.95 in 2013 with an average probability of overwinter survival of 0.65±0.11. Despite high interannual variability, a significant decline in the length of the overwintering period with time was observed in the long-term observational data (
