<p class="p">The conservative approach projected a decline in the length of the overwintering period to 90±1 days and an increase in the probability of overwinter survival to 0.86±0.01 by the year 2100 (red lines in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219555.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref> - top panel). The multi-model ensemble of downscaled climate model data projected a decline in the length of the overwintering period to 56±15 days and an increase in the probability of overwinter survival to 0.95±0.03 by the year 2100 (blue lines in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219555.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref> –top panel). A t-test indicated significant differences in the estimated length of the overwintering period and the probability of overwinter survival between the conservative and downscaled approaches (2017–2030, 2031–2050, 2051–2070, 2071–2100; P&lt;0.05 for all year groups for both tests). As the uncertainties in our estimates of overwintering period length and overwinter survival are based on long-term trends and the interannual variability in these projections is expected to be much larger than the uncertainty bounds quantified here.
