  <title class="title">Observational air and water temperatures used in this study.</title>
  <p class="p">Columns are as follows: Date—take temperature reading was taken. CBL Water Temp (degC)—water temperature in degrees Celsius taken at CBL pier. Temperature was taken once daily using a mercury thermometer from 1938–2012. Temperature was taken every 15 minutes using a YSI (details in methods section) from 2012–2016. Temperature readings taken during this later time period were averaged per day. CBL Air Temp (degC)—same as CBL Water Temp but for air temperature. CBP Water Temp (degC)—water temperature in degrees Celsius taken by the Chesapeake Bay Program at stations LE1.3 and LE1.4 (details in methods section). NOAA Solomons Air Temp (degC)—air temperature in degrees Celsius at NOAA buoy number 8577330. NOAA Solomons Water Temp (degC)—same as NOAA Solomons Air Temp but for water temperature. NOAA CovePt Air Temp (degC)—air temperature in degrees Celsius at NOAA buoy number 8577018. NOAA CovePt Water Temp (degC)—same as NOAA CovePt Air Temp but for water temperature. Combined Air Temp (degC)—air temperature for all data sources combined. If an observation was recorded at CBL, that value was used first. Then the data sources were used in the following order: NOAA Solomons, CBP, CovePt. This created the most complete observational data set possible. Combined Water Temp (degC)—same as Combined Air Temp but for water temperature.</p>
