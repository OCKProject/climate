<p id="Par10" class="p">Finally, we estimated the changes in the frequency of 1 and 3-day CHDHN events under the 1.5, 2 and 3 °C warming worlds. The Paris agreement aims to limit the global mean temperature below 2 °C and more ambitiously below 1.5 °C from the pre-industrial level by the end of 21

 </sup> argued that the global mean temperature is most likely to overshoot the 1.5 and 2 °C limits and reach the 3 °C (ranging between 2 °C to 4.9 °C) limit by the end of 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century. The ratio of the number of 1 and 3-day CHDHN events under the 1.5, 2, and 3 °C warming worlds to the number of 1 and 3-day CHDHN events was estimated under the current climate (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). One and 3-day CHDHN events are projected to increase by 4, 6, and 8-folds (of the current level) in India under the 1.5, 2, and 3 °C warming worlds, respectively (Fig.

 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4g</xref>) is likely to increase by 4, 5.5, and 6.5 fold increase under the 1.5, 2, and 3 °C temperature targets respectively. The projected increase in 1 and 3-day CHDHN events under the different temperature targets is statistically significant at 5% level for both mean and distribution (Fig.
