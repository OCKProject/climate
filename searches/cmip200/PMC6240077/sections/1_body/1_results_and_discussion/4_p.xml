<p id="Par8" class="p">Next, we analyze the temporal changes in 1 and 3-day CHDHN events in the projected future climate using data from eight CMIP5-GCMs for the four RCPs. For each 21-year moving window centered on each year from 2005 to 2090, the ratio (Future/Current) of the frequency of 1 and 3-day CHDHN events to the current world was estimated (21-year window centered on 2016 based on RCP8.5; see methods). Therefore, CHDHN ratio higher than one suggests an increase in the frequency of 1 and 3-day CHDHN events under the future climate. Under the RCP4.5 scenario, all India averaged frequency of 3-day CHDHN events (relative to the current world) is likely to become 4-fold by the end-21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3e</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4e</xref>). If the global mean temperature continues to rise rapidly, India is projected to witness 4–5 fold rise in 3-day CHDHN events by mid-21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century under RCP 8.5. More remarkably, India is projected to experience a 12-fold increase CHDHN events by the end of the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century under RCP 8.5 (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3e</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4e</xref>). This rise in 3-day CHDHN events under the projected warming will not be localized instead it is projected to cover a majority of India (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3d</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4d</xref>). The benefit of climate change mitigation is well reflected as under the low-emission scenario (RCP 2.6), the increase in 3-day CHDHN events can be limited to only 2-fold by the end of the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century in comparison to the 12-fold under RCP 8.5. The increase in both 1 and 3-day CHDHN events is consistent, and the projected future climate and is statistically significant at 5% level in the reference period (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3f</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4f</xref>). To quantify the reliability of muli-model ensemble (MME) mean
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">34</xref>
 </sup>, we estimated the ratio of MME mean and standard deviation (intermodel variation) for each RCPs for the projected future climate. Projections based on CMIP5 models showed the ratio (MME/std) greater than one indicating high reliability of CHDHN projections (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S5b,d</xref>). We find that despite the intermodel variation among different RCPs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S5</xref>), our projections of 1 and 3-day CHDHN are robust (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S5</xref>).
