 </sup>, anthropogenic warming can lead to a wide-spread and significant increase. To evaluate the role of anthropogenic emissions on the occurrence of the CHDHN events in India, we estimated the ratio of the number of CHDHN events based on the Hist and HistNat (Hist/HistNat) scenarios during 1975–2013 using 50 simulations from the C20C+ D&amp;A project (see methods for details). The ratio is higher than 1 in the majority of India indicating that anthropogenic emissions contribute to the increased frequency of CHDHN events. Furthermore, western and southern India show that 1 and 3-day CHDHN events have increased 1.5–2 times while in northeastern India, these events have more than doubled due to anthropogenic emissions. Since the C20C+ simulations do not consider the influence of irrigation, the differences in the observed and C20C+ simulations over the Indo-Gangetic Plain are expected. The increase in 1 and 3-day CHDHN events in western and southern India is consistent with the observations (Figs
