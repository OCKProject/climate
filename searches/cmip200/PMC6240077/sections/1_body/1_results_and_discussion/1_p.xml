<p id="Par5" class="p">First, we estimate the average frequency of 3-day CHDHN events during the observed period of 1951–2016 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). On an average two 3-day CHDHN events per year occurred over most of India during 1951–2016 suggesting that 3-day CHDHN are not common during the summer (April-June) season in the observed climate. To analyze if these events have increased during the recent period, our period of analysis was divided into two halves (as the period 1951–1983 (pre-1984), and 1984–2016 (post-1984)) each consisting of 33 years. Then, the average frequency of 1 and 3-day CHDHN events in these two periods was estimated (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>), and the difference was examined (post-1984-pre-1984). We show that western, north-eastern, and southern part of India have experienced an increase of about three events (3-day CHDHN) per year in the post-1984 period. Furthermore, night-time extreme heat events are increasing more rapidly than daytime events (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>). The frequency of 3-day CHDHN events has declined over the Indo-Gangetic plain and part of eastern India in the post-1984 period (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1d</xref>). This decline in CHDHN events can be partially attributed to the influence of irrigation and atmospheric aerosols
