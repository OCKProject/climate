<p id="Par12" class="p">Other than the large-scale climate features (e.g., ENSO), the frequency of CHDHN events in India under the current and projected future climate can be affected by local conditions (land use/land cover, irrigation, and aerosols) related to land surface and atmosphere. For instance, intensive irrigation and aerosols over the Indo-Gangetic Plain can reduce surface and air temperature

 </sup>. Presence of aerosols can influence solar radiation
