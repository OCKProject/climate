<p id="Par9" class="p">To compare the impact of low and high emission pathways (RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5), we estimated changes in the frequency of 3-day CHDHN events in the mid (2030–2050) and far (2070–2090) periods to the current world (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a–d</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4a–d</xref>). This comparison between the two emission scenarios makes the impact of climate change more prominently visible and has been used in the previous study related to surface temperature over India

 </sup>. The low emission scenario (RCP 2.6) is unlikely to lead to a substantial increase in 1 and 3-day CHDHN events in the mid and far periods of the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref>), which highlights the importance of the climate change mitigation. However, if the global mean temperature follows the high-emission pathway of RCP8.5, the frequency of 1 and 3-day CHDHN events is likely to become 3 and 8-fold of the current climate in the mid and far periods (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref>). In addition to that, the increase in the frequency of 1 and 3-day CHDHN events in the mid and far periods are found to be statistically significant at 5% level based on the RCP 8.5 scenarios (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3f</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4f</xref>). Under the two intermediate scenarios of RCP 4.5, and 6.0, the frequency of 1 and 3 day CHDHN events is projected to increase by 4–6 fold during the far-period (2070–2090) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S6</xref>), which is higher than the low emission scenario of RCP 2.6. Our results again highlight the benefits of climate change mitigation as the projected increase in the low-emission scenario (RCP 2.6) is much lesser than the other emission scenarios (RCP 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5).
