<p id="Par11" class="p">The CHDHN events are likely to rise substantially in India under the warming climate. Change in mean and distribution of summer temperature under the future climate can result in an increased frequency of CHDHN events under different (1.5–3.0 °C) warming worlds. Increased frequency of heatwaves is more prominently linked with the change in mean rather than the change in the distribution of temperature
