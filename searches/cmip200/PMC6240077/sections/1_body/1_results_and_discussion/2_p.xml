  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>
 </sup> during 1971–2010, which is mainly due to decline in short-wave radiation. However, both vegetation and evapotranspiration have substantially increased over the Indo-Gangetic Plain mainly due to intensive irrigation

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">29</xref>
 </sup>. Therefore, increased evaporative cooling over the Indo-Gangetic Plain can be attributed to irrigation. Other than irrigation, atmospheric aerosols may also play a role in offsetting surface temperature by solar dimming over the Gangetic Plain, which has been reported in previous studies

 </sup>. We confirmed this decline in the frequency of 3-day CHDHN over the Indo-Gangetic plain by estimating nonparametric (using Mann-Kendall test and Sen’s slope method) trends in 3-day mean daily average temperature for the 1951–2016 period (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>). A significant (p-value &lt; 0.05) decline in 3-day mean temperature over the Indo-Gangetic Plain indicates the potential role of irrigation and atmospheric aerosols. Overall, the majority of western and southern India has experienced a significant increase in the frequency of 1 and 3-day CHDHN events during the post-1984 period (Figs
