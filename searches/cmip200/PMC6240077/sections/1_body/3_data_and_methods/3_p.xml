 </sup>. We selected the GCMs based on their availability for the historical scenario and the four representative concentration pathways (RCPs: RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5) for the r1i1p1 realization available from the period 1950 onwards. The four RCPs correspond to the four different levels of emission scenarios for the future climate with RCP8.5 representing the highest and RCP2.6 representing the lowest emission scenarios. The data were regridded to 1° spatial resolution using bi-linear interpolation to make it consistent with the other (IMD and C20C+) datasets. The regridded temperature was then compared against temperature at GCMs’ native resolution, and we found that the interpolated data were consistent spatially and temporally.
