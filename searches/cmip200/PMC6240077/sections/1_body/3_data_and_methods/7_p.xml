<p id="Par24" class="p">The changes in the frequency of the CHDHN events under the projected future climate were estimated based on the 8 CMIP5-GCMs for the four RCPs to the current world. We define the current world as the period of 21 years centered on 2016 based on the highest emission scenario (RCP8.5) to avoid the overestimation in our estimates as described in King

 </sup>. This is also justified as the observed increase in the global mean temperature is higher than the lower emission scenarios
