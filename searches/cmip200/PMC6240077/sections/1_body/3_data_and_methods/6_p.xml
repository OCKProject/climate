 </sup>. Therefore, we focus on the period 1975 onwards to study the role of anthropogenic emission on CHDHN events. To do so, we estimated the ratio of the number of CHDHN events in the Hist to the number of CHDHN events in the HistNat scenario. Since the Hist scenario incorporates the anthropogenic forcings unlike the HistNat scenario which represents the climate without human influence, a ratio higher than one indicates the presence of the anthropogenic contribution to the CHDHN events.
