<p id="Par21" class="p">The selected GCMs show both negative and positive bias in Tmax and Tmin against the observed data (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>). Warm bias in CMIP5 GCMs is centered mainly in the central and western India (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S8</xref>). Furthermore, different GCMs may have different land surface conditions, which can affect surface temperature simulations. For instance, the surface temperature gets amplified if the interaction between land surface and clouds are not well represented in the models

 </sup>. To understand uncertainty CHDHN events, we estimated multi-model mean and standard deviation (uncertainty) for diurnal temperature range (DTR) during the summer season (AMJ) for the historic period of 1971–2000 (used as reference period to estimate CHDHN events). Consistent with the warm bias over the western and central India, we notice an intermodel uncertainty of 1–3 °C in DTR inCMIP5-GCMs (Fig.
