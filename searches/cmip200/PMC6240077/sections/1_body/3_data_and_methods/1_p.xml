<p id="Par18" class="p">We used the daily maximum (Tmax) and minimum (Tmin) air temperature for the period 1951–2016 from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) to estimate CHDHN events in the observed climate. The gridded temperature data are developed using Shepard’s distance weighted interpolation

We have regridded the temperature data to 1° spatial resolution using bi-linear interpolation to make it consistent with the data from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5)
