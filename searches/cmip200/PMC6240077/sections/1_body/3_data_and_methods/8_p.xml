<p id="Par25" class="p">Finally, the changes in CHDHN events were analysed under the warming limits of 1.5, 2, and 3 °C rise in global mean temperature to the pre-industrial period (1861–1900). We followed the same procedure as used in King,

 </sup> and selected the model years corresponding to each warming limit (1.5, 2, and 3 °C) and refer them as 1.5, 2, and 3 warming world. First, we estimated temperature anomaly of the decadal average of global mean temperature using the baseline period (pre-industrial:1861–1890) under the historical scenario. We selected the 1.5 °C world for each model as all years within the decades with temperature 1.3–1.7 °C warmer than the corresponding model baseline for all the RCPs. For the 2 °C and 3 °C warming worlds, the same method was applied, only the temperature range was changed to 1.8–2.2 °C, and 2.8–3.2 °C, respectively. Then, the CHDHN ratio was estimated for each grid as the ratio of the number of CHDHN events in the 1.5, 2, and 3 °C worlds, respectively, to that in the current world.
