<p id="Par22" class="p">A percentile-based approach was used to estimate the CHDHN events based on the summer (April to June) daily Tmax and Tmin during the reference period of 1971–2000. Hot days (nights) for each grid location are identified if Tmax (Tmin) exceeds the 95
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> percentile threshold for the reference period (1971–2000). Then CHDHN events were identified if a hot day and hot night occur for the same day for a given period (Fig.

 </sup> reported that extreme temperature events occurring continuously for 3 or more days pose a significant threat to human health. Therefore, we analyze the CHDHN events following the same methodology (as for daily events) but using the 3-day moving mean of daily Tmax and Tmin. Thus, our analysis is based on two sets of CHDHN events, one based on the daily Tmax and Tmin data [1-day CHDHN] and the other is based on the 3-day Tmax and Tmin [3-day CHDHN].
