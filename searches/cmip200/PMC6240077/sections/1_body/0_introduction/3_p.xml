<p id="Par4" class="p">Here, we provide a first-ever assessment based on concurrent hot day and hot night (CHDHN) events over India for the observed (1951–2016) and projected future climate. Apart from 1-day CHDHN events, we evaluate the changes in 3-day CHDHN events using 3-day moving average of daily maximum and minimum temperatures

 </sup>. The effect of anthropogenic warming on CHDHN events is examined using simulations from Climate of 20
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> century plus (C20C+) detection and attribution (D&amp;A) project for the Historical (Hist) and Historical Natural (HistNat) scenarios. We report the changes in the frequency of CHDHN events in the future climate scenario using data from global climate models (GCMs) that participated in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). Finally, we report the changes in CHDHN events in India under the 1.5 °C, 2 °C, and 3 °C warming worlds.
