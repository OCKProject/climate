 <list list-type="order" class="list">
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p id="Par14" class="p">The frequency of 1 and 3-day CHDHN events has increased in large part of western and southern India during the post-1984 period. Night-time heat events have increased more rapidly than the day-time heat events during the recent few decades in India. However, Indo-Gangetic Plain and eastern parts have experienced a decline in the frequency of 1 and 3-day CHDHN events, which can be partially associated with the local cooling due to irrigation and atmospheric aerosols.</p>

  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p id="Par15" class="p">The frequency of 1 and 3-day CHDHN events increases significantly under the anthropogenic emissions. Under the high emission scenario of RCP 8.5, the frequency of 3-day CHDHN events is projected to increase 12-fold of the current level by the end of 21
    <sup class="sup">st</sup> century and 4-fold by the mid 21
    <sup class="sup">st</sup> century. On the other hand, the frequency of 3-day CHDHN is projected to increase to 4 and 2-fold of the current frequency by the end of the 21
    <sup class="sup">st</sup> century under the emission scenarios of RCP 4.5 and 2.6. The difference in the rise in the frequency of CHDHN events in India under the high and low emission scenarios highlights the importance of climate change mitigation.

   <p id="Par16" class="p">Limiting global mean temperature to 1.5 °C from the pre-industrial level can be beneficial in reducing the risks of 1 and 3-day CHDHN events in India. For instance, a rise of 1.5 °C in the global mean temperature is projected to cause a 4-fold increase in the frequency of 3-day CHDHN from the current level. An additional warming of 0.5 °C (under 2 °C warming world) is likely to cause an increase of 6-fold in the frequency of 3-day CHDHN events in India. Moreover, failing to limit the global mean temperature below 2 °C can lead to a rise in 8-fold in the frequency of 3-day CHDHN events in India (under 3 °C target).</p>
