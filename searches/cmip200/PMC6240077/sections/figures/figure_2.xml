   <bold class="bold">a</bold>) Multi-ensemble mean of ratio of 3-day CHDHN in the Hist to that in HistNat scenario during the period 1975â€“2013 based on 50 simulation from CAM5.1 model under the C20C+ D&amp;A project. CHDHN ratio is estimated using 3-day moving mean daily temperature values, and (
