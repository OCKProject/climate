<p class="p">[12.] The evaluation of temperature in the CMIP5 simulations (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" class="xref">1</xref>, bottom row) suggests a tendency for a systematic cold bias in the multimodel ensemble (0.4 and 1.3 K colder than the reference on a global average for CMIP5 and CMIP3, respectively). The temperature biases are even more pronounced when compared to a different reference data set (ERA-Interim, not shown). In regions with water-limited regimes (see Figure S4), the underestimation of temperature is likely related to the identified systematic ET overestimation, linked with enhanced evaporative cooling in the model simulations [e.g.,

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" class="xref">1</xref> bottom left and middle) is related to the ET underestimation there (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" class="xref">1</xref> top left and middle, i. e., underestimation of evaporative cooling). One of the few regions where the temperature and ET biases are not of opposite sign is India, where previous studies disagreed on the existence of strong soil moisture-temperature coupling [
