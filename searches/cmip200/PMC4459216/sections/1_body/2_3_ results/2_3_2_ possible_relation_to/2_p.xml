<p class="p">[13.] Analyses of ET and temperature biases for Northern Hemispheric summer (JJA) are provided in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" class="xref">1</xref> (right column). Interestingly, these analyses reveal biases of opposite sign compared to those on annual time scale in some regions (ET underestimation and temperature overestimation in most regions during JJA) and more pronounced biases in others. Results for the boreal winter are provided in Figure S5. They are generally more consistent with the annual biases but also display a tendency for low ET and high temperatures in Southern Hemisphere midlatitudes.
