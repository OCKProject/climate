 <italic class="italic">Christensen and Boberg</italic>, 
 <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>], CMIP5 simulations display a tendency to overestimate warm temperatures, which is consistent with our seasonal results despite the cold and wet biases identified on annual time scale. Quantile-quantile plots of ET and temperature from CMIP5 versus reference data sets (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" class="xref">3</xref> and S6) show an overestimation of ET in the wettest months as well as an underestimation (overestimation) of temperature in cold (warm) months. A tendency to underestimate ET in dry months is present in a few regions only, which may be due to the bounded lower limit of ET (zero flux). We note that most CMIP5 models display these patterns, but that they are more pronounced in some of the models. These analyses confirm the presence of systematic biases in both the ET and temperature distributions in most regions.
