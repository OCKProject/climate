<p class="p">[11.]Â Hence, though there are some exceptions in a few regions, the identified overestimation of ET over a large fraction of land areas is found to be driven by a corresponding overestimation of precipitation in these regions. In a global average, the overestimation of ET amounts to 0.17 mm/d (CMIP5) and 0.09 mm/d (CMIP3). The biases for precipitation are similar (0.16 mm/d for CMIP5 and 0.05 mm/d for CMIP3) when GPCP is employed as a reference data set. However, precipitation in GPCP is relatively high compared to other reference data sets. For instance, the precipitation bias of the CMIP5 and CMIP3 ensemble relative to the Climate Research Unit (CRU) precipitation data set is 0.27 mm/d and 0.22 mm/d. Overall, higher overestimation of precipitation than ET appears consistent with the assumption that the former drives the latter (although the presence of feedback cannot be excluded).</p>
