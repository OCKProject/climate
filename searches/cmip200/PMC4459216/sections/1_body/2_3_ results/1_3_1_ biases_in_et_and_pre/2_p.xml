<p class="p">[9.] A more in-depth evaluation of the CMIP5 and CMIP3 ET fields (annual means) for 25 regions based on the definition of the IPCC Special Report on Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation (SREX) [see 
 <italic class="italic">Seneviratne et al.</italic>, 
 <xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>] is provided in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" class="xref">2</xref>. This regional analysis compares the respective spreads of the CMIP3 and CMIP5 ensemble (box plots) and the median (full lines) and interquartile range (dotted lines) of the LandFlux-EVAL synthesis product (red lines for CMIP5 underestimation, blue lines for overestimation). The overall systematic overestimation of ET is confirmed for most considered regions. CMIP simulations (medians) are consistent with the LandFlux-EVAL estimates (interquartile ranges) in 16 (CMIP3) and 12 (CMIP5) out of the 25 regions. The intermodel spread is on average similar for the CMIP3 and the CMIP5 ensemble, indicating no systematic improvement in the newer multimodel ensemble in terms of ET. This fact is confirmed by the average root-mean-square errors for the respective ensembles (see Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1" class="xref">1</xref>).
