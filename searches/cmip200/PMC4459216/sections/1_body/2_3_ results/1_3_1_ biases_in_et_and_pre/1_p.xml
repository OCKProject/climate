 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" class="xref">1</xref> (top row) displays the difference in ET between the CMIP simulations and the LandFlux-EVAL synthesis product for annual means (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" class="xref">1</xref>, left column: CMIP3 and Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" class="xref">1</xref>, middle column: CMIP5) and June to August means (JJA; Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" class="xref">1</xref>, right column: CMIP5, see Figure S1 in the supporting information for relative differences). Regions where at least 66% of the models (i. e., 10 out of 14 for CMIP5 and 8 out of 11 for CMIP3) agree on the sign of the difference are overlayed with stripes. In the annual average, the CMIP simulations display an overall systematic overestimation of ET in most regions, in particular in Europe, Africa, China, Australia, Western North America, and part of the Amazon region. This bias is slightly more pronounced in CMIP5 than in the previous CMIP3 ensemble (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" class="xref">1</xref>), (see also 
 <italic class="italic">Mueller et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>]). India is one of the few regions where the CMIP simulations are too dry. The CMIP5 simulations display consistent (and thus shared) biases in more regions than the CMIP3 simulations.
