<p class="p">[10.] To assess the possible causes and implications of this systematic bias, we also compare the CMIP5 and CMIP3 simulations with observational data sets of precipitation and temperature in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" class="xref">1</xref> (middle and bottom rows). This analysis reveals a systematic overestimation of precipitation in the CMIP simulations in the annual mean values (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" class="xref">1</xref>, left and middle columns, see also Figures S2 and S3) in most of the regions displaying a systematic overestimation of ET, thus highlighting precipitation biases as likely driver for the ET biases. Indeed, most of these regions are characterized by a soil moisture-limited ET regime (Figure S4), and thus additional precipitation is generally used by ET in these regions [e.g.,

 <italic class="italic">Seneviratne et al.</italic>, 
 <xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>]. Nonetheless, a few tropical regions display an underestimation of precipitation despite an overestimation of ET, which is realistic in regions where ET is not limited by water availability, but rather by the incoming net radiation [

 <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2003</xref>]. It should also be noted that a few regions display systematic dry biases rather than systematic wet biases (i. e., underestimation of ET and precipitation), such as India, the Mississippi River Basin, and Argentina.
