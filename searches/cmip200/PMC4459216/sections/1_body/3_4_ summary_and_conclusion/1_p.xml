<p class="p">[15.]Â This article provides an evaluation of ET in the recent CMIP5 and CMIP3 multimodel ensembles. These first analyses reveal systematic land hydrological and climate biases in the CMIP simulations, characterized by an overestimation of ET in the yearly average in many land regions. These biases can be generally related to a corresponding overestimation of precipitation in most of the identified regions, which is driving the ET bias. Concomitantly, the excess evaporative cooling leads to a cold bias in most of the identified regions on the annual time scale. These biases are generally found in regions with soil moisture-limited ET regimes, with a few exceptions, and tend to change sign in the warm season in midlatitude regions.</p>
