<p class="p">[16.]Â The possibly underlying causes for the identified biases as well as consequences for CMIP5 projections would need to be investigated in follow-up studies. Direct interaction between precipitation (clouds) and temperature may also be possible. Furthermore, the direction of causality cannot always be fully established, and it is possible that in some regions the diagnosed biases are unrelated. For instance, in energy-limited regions, one would expect the opposite relationship, i. e., temperature biases would cause ET biases (of same sign rather than opposite sign). However, these results highlight the presence of remaining systematic biases in state-of-art climate models, which are similar in magnitude for the CMIP5 and the CMIP3 ensembles (and even larger for the former). Previous studies pointed out the fact that extensive model developments were undertaken between the two series of experiments [e.g.,
