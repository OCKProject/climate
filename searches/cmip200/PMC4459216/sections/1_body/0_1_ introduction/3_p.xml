<p class="p">[4.]Â In the present article, we use one of these recently compiled data sets to evaluate the realism of land ET fields in simulations of the fifth phase of the CMIP project (CMIP5), which serve as basis for the fifth assessment report of the IPCC. These analyses are complemented with comparisons to the earlier CMIP3 multimodel ensemble (which served as basis for the fourth assessment report of the IPCC). Several recent studies have shown that soil moisture and ET have a strong influence on temperature in many regions of the world [

 <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>], since latent heat flux associated with ET uses a substantial fraction of the available net radiation on land. Whenever ET is reduced, the corresponding energy is instead used by sensible heat flux, leading to higher air temperatures. Due to this strong relation between evaporation and temperature, we validate also temperature fields over land and assess where their biases can be related to biases in ET. We also include an evaluation of precipitation in the CMIP simulations in order to investigate the causes of the ET biases.
