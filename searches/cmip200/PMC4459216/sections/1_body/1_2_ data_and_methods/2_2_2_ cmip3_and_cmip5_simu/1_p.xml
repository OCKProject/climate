<p class="p">[7.] Simulations of 14 models contributing to the CMIP5 [
 <italic class="italic">Taylor et al.</italic>, 
 <xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>] and 11 models contributing to the CMIP3 multimodel experiments have been used (see Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1" class="xref">1</xref> for details). We evaluate the variable “surface latent heat flux” (i. e., ET, including both evaporation and sublimation), near-surface air temperature, and precipitation from the historical CMIP5 and the twentieth century CMIP3 simulations, respectively. All data have been linearly interpolated to a 1×1° resolution, corresponding to the resolution of the LandFlux-EVAL synthesis ET product.
