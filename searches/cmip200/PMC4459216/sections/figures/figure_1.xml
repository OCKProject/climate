  <p class="p">(left column) Difference in median of CMIP3 annual means, (middle column) CMIP5 annual means, and (right column) CMIP5 June to August means and reference data sets. The reference product for evapotranspiration (ET; top row) is the LandFlux-EVAL merged synthesis product, for precipitation (middle row) the GPCP data set, and for temperature (bottom row) the Willmott and Matsuura data set. Stripes indicate where at least 66% (i. e., 8 out of 11 for CMIP3 and 10 out of 14 and for CMIP5) of the models agree on the sign of the differences. Note the reversed color schemes for ET and precipitation versus temperature.</p>
