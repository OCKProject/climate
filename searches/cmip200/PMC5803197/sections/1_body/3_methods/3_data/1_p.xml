 </sup> that provide a fractionation of total rainfall rates into their convective and stratiform contributions for the time period 1998–2013. The rain type classification in TRMM is designated as the algorithm 2A-23. The algorithm uses precipitation radar measurements and two different methods (V-method and H-method) to classify precipitation at each grid point into the three categories stratiform, convective and other. Details on the method can be found in Awaka
