 </sup>. The low-resolution version (hereafter “LR”) is run at a horizontal resolution of ~2.8° (T42, 31 vertical levels), while both the horizontal and vertical resolution are increased for the medium-resolution version (hereafter “MR”) at ~0.75° (T159) and 62 levels. A further increase of the horizontal resolution (T255, ~0.47°, 62 levels) is used for the high-resolution version (hereafter “HR”). The top level is the same at about 5 hPa in all three configurations. Additional levels are placed in between the 31 levels and concentrate towards the surface. Parametrization schemes, as for example cloud microphysics and optical properties or cumulus convection, are scale-aware in ECHAM5
