 </sup> and define two rainfall indices of zonally averaged precipitation between 10°W to 10°E, one southern index from the equator to 7.5°N and a northern index from 7.5°N to 20°N. Both indices are smoothed with a 15-day low-pass filter and normalized by their respective standard deviations to reduce the influence of mean-state biases in the coupled models. The onset is defined as the first day after 1 June where the northern index exceeds the southern index for at least 15 consecutive days, or for the longest period in years that have no clear onset.
