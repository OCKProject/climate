 </sup> greatly reduced the strength and extent of the tropical Atlantic warm SST bias in the Kiel Climate Model (KCM) by a simultaneous increase of horizontal and vertical atmospheric model resolution leading among others to enhanced surface wind stress. A large part of the wind stress biases at lower resolution arise from insufficient meridional and vertical zonal momentum transport in the atmosphere, and the misrepresentation of the orography surrounding the tropical Atlantic in the spectral atmospheric component
