<p id="Par3" class="p">Sahel rainfall is inevitably linked to the annual cycle of the West African Monsoon (WAM). The associated northward migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) is the result of a complicated interaction between the Saharan heat low developing over the warming continent and the cooling ocean associated with the Atlantic Cold Tongue (ACT) development

 </sup>. The maximum continental warming follows the solar heating northward, whereas the maximum cooling of the ocean surface, driven by meridional and zonal wind stress, is geographically fixed just south of the Equator. These different physical processes combined with land-air interactions
