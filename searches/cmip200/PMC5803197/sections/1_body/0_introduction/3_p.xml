<p id="Par4" class="p">Given the limited observations in this region, climate models would be an ideal tool to identify the causes of past variability and assess the future evolution. But persistent biases especially in the tropical Atlantic region challenge the applicability of current climate models in addressing those questions. Nearly all state-of-the-art climate models suffer from serious biases in precipitation, surface winds and temperatures in this region

 </sup>. One of the most apparent shortcomings is the too warm sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the eastern tropical Atlantic during boreal spring and summer

 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref>) and a corresponding reversed equatorial zonal SST gradient. In contrast to the tropical Pacific, most models are not able to reproduce the seasonal cold tongue evolution in the tropical Atlantic south of the equator. Moreover, the errors in the mean state strongly bias the interannual variability in the models
