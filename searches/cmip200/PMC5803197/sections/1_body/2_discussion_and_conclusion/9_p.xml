<p id="Par27" class="p">Another obvious shortcoming is the excessive precipitation during May and June around the Gulf of Guinea visible in all KCM simulations. This overestimation of the ITCZ strength gets even amplified with increasing atmospheric resolution. We find the same model behavior for the atmosphere-only configurations and therefore attribute it to an internal model limitation rather than to flawed boundary conditions. Other studies also find a general intensification of tropical ITCZ

 </sup> find that the vertical motions and rainfall north of the equator strengthen with increased resolution by enhanced southerly advection of zonal momentum. We further speculate that the existing cloud and convection parameterizations were developed for lower model resolutions and maybe need additional testing and tuning to reduce the overly strong ITCZ at higher atmospheric resolutions.
