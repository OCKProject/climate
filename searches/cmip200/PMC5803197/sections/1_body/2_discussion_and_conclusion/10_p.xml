<p id="Par28" class="p">We want to emphasize that area-averaged indices, like the Sahel index used here, always allow that model deficits are masked by error compensation. The very good agreement in the total precipitation Sahel index between HR and the observations is partly caused by counteracting effects of a wet bias of the large-scale precipitation in the southern part of the Sahel box and a dry bias of the convective precipitation in the north. The resulting coastal precipitation is higher than in HR (A) throughout the WAM season and therefore leads to later mean WAM onset date. In fact, the mean onset day in HR (July 8) is closer to observations (July 2) than in the corresponding atmosphere-only simulation (June 13).</p>
