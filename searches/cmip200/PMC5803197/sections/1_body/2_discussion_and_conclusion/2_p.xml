 </sup> find modest forecast skill in a regional climate model at 2â€“3 months lead time that derives from tropical Atlantic sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in June. In contrast to our study, these seasonal forecasting systems are initialized with ocean temperatures derived from observations or reanalysis data sets. This means that during their forecast period of several weeks or months these models will normally not experience as severe SST biases as discussed in this paper. In our work we do not assess the seasonal prediction skill in the KCM, but rather show that also multi-year control integrations of global climate models can show robust correlations between the timing of the WAM and equatorial SSTs several weeks or even a few months in advance. Models with less SST bias that simulate an earlier start of the ACT
 <sub class="sub">SST</sub> formation show a tendency for a longer lasting influence on the WAM. Moreover, in the case of an overall too late or too weak ACT
 <sub class="sub">SST</sub> the precipitation over the Sahel shows a more gradual progression following the solar insolation maximum. The improvements shown for the KCM can eventually lead to a better representation of the mean state in future versions of regional forecast models or could be used to identify changes between the SST-WAM coupling under future warming scenarios in global climate model simulations.
