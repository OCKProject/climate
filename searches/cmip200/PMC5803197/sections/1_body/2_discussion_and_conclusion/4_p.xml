<p id="Par22" class="p">Sufficiently high atmosphere model resolution is a key in the KCM to reduce biases in the tropical Atlantic sector mean climate and seasonal to interannual variability, in particular with regard to Sahel rainfall. This has been shown by a set of integrations of the KCM with varying atmospheric but fixed oceanic resolution. With regard to that model, Harla√ü

 </sup> find that the vertical atmosphere model resolution is of particular importance for tropical Atlantic interannual variability. Whether these promising results can help to improve tropical climate simulations in other, especially non-spectral atmospheric models needs to be tested in the future.
