<p id="Par24" class="p">In the set of KCM simulations, the influence of the reduced SST bias in boreal summer is mainly expressed as a shift of the rainfall maximum from the Gulf of Guinea in the eastern part of the tropical Atlantic in the low-atmospheric resolution version (LR) towards the central and western parts of the basin at medium (MR) and high (HR) atmospheric resolution.

 </sup> find a similar influence of the SST bias in an idealized study with ECHAM6, the successor to the atmosphere model used in the KCM. They further show how this westward shift is associated with an increase of easterly trade winds and moisture advection along the equator.
