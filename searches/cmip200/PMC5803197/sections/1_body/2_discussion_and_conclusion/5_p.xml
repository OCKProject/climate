<p id="Par23" class="p">We still see significant biases even in the highest-resolution version of the KCM (HR, T255L62), which not only are reflected in the tropical Atlantic SST but also in a too narrow, slightly southward displaced precipitation maximum over West Africa. Nevertheless, there is a strong link between the interannual variability of the ACT and WAM onset in the HR-version. We are therefore optimistic that models depicting reasonable ACT/WAM correlation, including some of the CMIP5 models, can be successfully used to forecast WAM onset at lead times of several weeks even in the presence of mean state biases. Furthermore, Richter
