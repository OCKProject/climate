<p id="Par26" class="p">The Sahel rainfall in the KCM not only is affected by the flawed representation of tropical Atlantic SSTs but also by inherent limitations of the atmospheric model component itself. Even when forced by observed SSTs the low-resolution configuration LR (A) is not able to transport enough moisture onto the West African continent and produce sufficient Sahel rainfall. All atmosphere-only runs place the precipitation maximum further to the western tropical Atlantic than observed. The magnitude of the wet bias even increases from LR (A) to MR (A) and to HR (A).

 </sup> show that current atmosphere models can be divided into two groups based on their Atlantic maximum precipitation being located either near the coast of Brazil or the coast of Guinea, and that this grouping already originates in boreal spring. We hypothesize that the moisture advection into the Sahel in LR is strongly limited by the low-resolution atmosphere model and therefore less sensitive to tropical SSTs than MR and HR.
