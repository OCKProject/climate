<p id="Par21" class="p">All KCM and CMIP5 simulations show a delayed onset and smaller extent of the Atlantic cold tongue during boreal spring and summer compared to the observations. The associated warmer sea surface temperatures in the simulations are generally linked to higher rates of marine precipitation in the Gulf of Guinea. A comparison of the coupled and uncoupled simulations shows that this is the main reason for the coastal wet bias in the KCM configurations during July to September. The earlier and stronger cold tongue development in HR and the resulting lower surface temperatures greatly reduce the bias in the Gulf of Guinea compared to LR and MR. The resulting earlier demise of coastal precipitation and shift of the precipitation maximum into the Sahel in HR leads to a WAM onset that is three weeks earlier than in LR and very close to the observed one. The three simulations show the dominant influence of southeastern and equatorial SSTs on the strength of coastal precipitation and timing of the WAM onset in the KCM.</p>
