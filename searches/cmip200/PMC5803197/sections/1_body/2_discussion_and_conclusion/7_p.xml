<p id="Par25" class="p">The tropical Atlantic SST biases affect Sahel rainfall mainly by a southward displacement of the monsoonal system, expressed by the African Easterly Jet (AEJ) and Tropical Easterly Jet (TEJ) core locations. The AEJ latitude for all atmosphere model versions used here is similar to the reanalysis values, when forced by observed SSTs. The coupled versions all place the AEJ farther south, leading to reduced rates of convective precipitation over the Sahel. The influence of the SST biases in the southeastern and northeastern tropical Atlantic is increased from LR to MR due to the enhanced cold SST bias off Senegal and Mauritania that limits the northward migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). This problem, however, is no longer present in HR. The strong relation between the TEJ and convective precipitation over the Sahel found here has been documented in previous studies about the interannual variability of the WAM
