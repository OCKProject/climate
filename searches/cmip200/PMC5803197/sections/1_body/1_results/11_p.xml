<p id="Par18" class="p">The CMIP5 models show a large spread in anomaly correlation with very low values in the ensemble-mean, but some models feature values comparable to the observations over the whole 90-day period considered. High correlations of WAM onset anomalies with the SST anomalies in the ACT
 <sub class="sub">SST</sub> region at a 44 day-lead is related to the quality with which interannual SST variability in the ACT
 <sub class="sub">SST</sub> region is simulated in the models (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4b</xref>). Higher correlation arises from more realistic seasonal phase locking with strong interannual variability in May-July (MJJ), rather than from its magnitude in that season (Fig. S
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">7</xref>), expressed as an increases of the explained variance (r
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) from 23 to 35%. This is the main difference between MR and HR. While the amplitude of the interannual SST variability in the ACT
 <sub class="sub">SST</sub> region is comparable, it establishes one month earlier in HR than in MR (Fig. S
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">8</xref>).
