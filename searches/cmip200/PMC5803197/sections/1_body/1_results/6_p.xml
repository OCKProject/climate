<p id="Par13" class="p">The observed seasonal meridional migration of precipitation over West Africa is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a</xref>. Significant precipitation starts at the coast of the Gulf of Guinea at 5°N around March and increases until it peaks in June. This coastal phase is overestimated in all KCM simulations with a narrowing and intensifying wet bias with increasing resolution. The WAM onset is marked by a distinct “jump” of the precipitation maximum from the coastal region to about 10°N with a mean observed onset day of July 2 and a standard deviation of 9.8 days. The major improvements in MR (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3c</xref>) and HR (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3d</xref>) lead to more realistic simulation of this inland rainfall maximum during JAS, while LR (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b</xref>) always simulates highest rainfall near the coastline.
