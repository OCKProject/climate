<p id="Par17" class="p">We now address the question whether this influence is captured in current climate models. Due to the severe SST biases in the ACT region present in most models, simulated ACT
 <sub class="sub">area</sub> onsets often occur after the WAM onset or do not exceed the threshold value at all (Fig. S
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">6</xref>). Therefore, we change from an absolute ACT
 <sub class="sub">area</sub> onset definition to a simple time series of SST anomalies averaged over the ACT region (hereafter ACT
 <sub class="sub">SST</sub>). A lead-lag correlation analysis with the WAM onset anomalies also yields a correlation of above 0.6 in the observations with the ACT
 <sub class="sub">SST</sub> leading by three weeks (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4a</xref>). We observe the strongest correlation of 0.73 when ACT
 <sub class="sub">SST</sub> is leading the WAM onset by 44 days (mid-May). Experiments LR and MR show no, or only modest correlations, while HR is consistent with the observations and simulates ACT
 <sub class="sub">SST</sub> anomalies that are significantly correlated with the WAM onset anomalies for about 90 days in advance. All uncoupled atmosphere model experiments show high correlations for lead times of up to one month, indicating that the specified SST variability is more important than the atmospheric resolution.
