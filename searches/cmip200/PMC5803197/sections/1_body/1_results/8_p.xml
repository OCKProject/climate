 </sup>. The TEJ in all KCM simulations is located further north than in ERA-Interim, which reduces the latitudinal range between TEJ and AEJ and favors the development of a narrower, stronger than observed Sahel rain band in MR and HR. The poleward shift of the TEJ and AEJ in LR leads to a slight increase in rainfall in the northern part of the Sahel during August.
