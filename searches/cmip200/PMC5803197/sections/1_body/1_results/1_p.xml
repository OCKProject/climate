<p id="Par8" class="p">The common limitations in simulating tropical Atlantic boreal summer SSTs are obvious both in the CMIP5 ensemble-mean (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref>) as well as in the KCM low-resolution configuration LR (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b</xref>). The largest deficit is a strong warm bias in the eastern part of the basin with maximum values in the upwelling regions off Southwest Africa. The warm bias persists throughout the year with maximum errors exceeding 6 °C at 20°S during boreal spring and summer. The western equatorial region is marked by colder than observed SSTs leading to absolute temperatures that are erroneously lower than those in the eastern part. The simultaneous increase of horizontal and vertical atmospheric resolution in MR (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1c</xref>) greatly reduces the warm bias in the east to below 3 °C and shifts its core slightly away from the coast. The stronger surface wind stress responsible for reducing the warm bias in the Benguela Current region

 </sup> also increases upwelling of colder waters in the Canary Current in the northeastern tropical Atlantic. The resulting reduced SSTs lead to an amplified meridional dipole bias pattern along the African coastline. The further increase of horizontal resolution in HR (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1d</xref>) reduces both the biases in the southeastern and northeastern tropical Atlantic to maximum values below 2 °C.
