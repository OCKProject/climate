<p id="Par10" class="p">Total rainfall in MR is comparable to LR due to a reduction of convective (subgrid-scale) and an increase in large-scale precipitation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b</xref>). The amount of large-scale precipitation in the KCM is more sensitive to the atmospheric resolution than to the prevailing SST biases. The spatial pattern of precipitation differences between HR (A) and LR (A) suggests a change of the tropical large-scale precipitation mainly in regions of elevated orography over the African continent (Fig. S
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>). The finer resolved topographic features in West Africa act to increase the overall large-scale precipitation amount over the coastal regions and the Sahel box. Interestingly TRMM and all reanalysis products also indicate a larger fraction of stratiform rainfall rates of up to 40%, while the CMIP5 models simulate mainly convective precipitation over the Sahel region. The coupled KCM integrations all place the core of the African Easterly Jet (AEJ) further to the south than their uncoupled counterparts, which is associated with a decrease of the convective precipitation for experiments MR and HR (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2c</xref>). The only minor improvements in AEJ location from MR to HR hint at more factors in addition to southeastern tropical SSTs that limit the northward migration of the AEJ. The CMIP5 models support the tendency of reduced convective precipitation over the Sahel for a more southern location of the AEJ. We find a significant correlation that explains 43% of the variability by a simple linear regression (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2c</xref>). The corresponding large-scale precipitation rates also show the lowest overall rates and intermodel spread for AEJ core locations southward of 12°N, but no significant correlation for more northern latitudes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2d</xref>).
