<p id="Par14" class="p">The flawed location of the strongest precipitation in LR is caused by a combination of resolution and SST dependent effects. The low atmospheric model resolution itself leads to a dry bias over the Sahel (Fig. S
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">4</xref>), while the too warm SSTs in the eastern tropical Atlantic result in excessive precipitation over the Gulf of Guinea and adjacent coastal regions (Fig. S
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>). The enhanced and earlier development of the ACT during boreal spring and summer in HR leads to an earlier demise of coastal precipitation compared to MR. The mean onset day of July 8 is about 2 weeks (3 weeks) earlier than in MR (LR) and only one week after the observed date. The observed WAM onset is characterized by a sudden reduction of Gulf of Guinea precipitation and a more gradual increase over the Sahel. The precipitation change associated with the onset in HR is distinctly stronger due a stronger northward moisture advection from the coast onto the continent (Fig. S
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">5</xref>). All experiments forced by observed SST simulate a too early onset in mid-June, that is mainly caused by a premature maximum and decline of precipitation at 5Â°N (Fig. S
