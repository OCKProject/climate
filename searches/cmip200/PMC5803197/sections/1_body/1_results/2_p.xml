<p id="Par9" class="p">There is a large spread in the annual cycle of total (large-scale plus convective) Sahel rainfall simulated by the CMIP5 models (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref>). Virtually all models correctly simulate peak rainfall in August, but the magnitudes range from 1 mm/day to 8 mm/day, while observations indicate around 4 mm/day to 6 mm/day. There is a general tendency of the models, including the KCM, to underestimate the rainfall in summer, which is due to a southward displacement of the precipitation maximum (Fig. S
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>). Although all KCM experiments reproduce the March to May (MAM) precipitation onset reasonably well, they differ in the simulated amplitude during the main monsoon months. A comparison of the coupled simulations with their atmosphere-only counterparts, i.e. forced by the observed SST record and indicated by a trailing (A), allows a separation into resolution and SST bias related differences. Surprisingly, the annual cycle of rainfall in LR and LR (A) is virtually identical, even though LR shows the largest SST biases. This suggests an inherent limitation of the atmospheric component in regard to the moisture advection into West Africa.
