<p id="Par12" class="p">Total Sahel rainfall and its fractionation are close to observations both in MR (A) and HR (A) throughout the year (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a and b</xref>). While HR shows a similar good performance, MR clearly underestimates total Sahel rainfall. This indicates that the Sahel rainfall in MR is not limited by the atmospheric component, but rather by the flawed simulation of tropical Atlantic SSTs.
