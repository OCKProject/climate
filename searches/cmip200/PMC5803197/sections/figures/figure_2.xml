  <p class="p">Simulated and observed Sahel rainfall. Coloured lines and symbols represent the coupled KCM simulations with low (LR), medium (MR) and high (HR) model resolution. The corresponding uncoupled integrations are named LR (A), MR (A) and HR (A). Red lines show a simple linear regression model including all 34 data sets together with the corresponding squared Pearson correlation coefficient (r
   <sup class="sup">2</sup>) and the p-value of the null hypothesis using a t-test. All variables are averaged over the domain 20°W-10°E and 10°N–20°N. (
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>) Annual cycle of the daily-mean total rainfall in mm/day. Shading spans the range of all CMIP5 models. Labels indicate the first day of each month. Vertical dashed lines mark July to September (JAS) rainy season. (
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>) Respective contributions of the large-scale and convective precipitation to the JAS total rainfall. Black line shows the observed PERSIANN total precipitation. (
   <bold class="bold">c</bold> and 
   <bold class="bold">d</bold>) JAS-mean latitude of the core of the African Easterly Jet (AEJ) versus (
   <bold class="bold">c</bold>) convective and (
   <bold class="bold">d</bold>) large-scale Sahel rainfall in mm/day. (
   <bold class="bold">e</bold> and 
   <bold class="bold">f</bold>) JAS-mean strength of the core of the Tropical Easterly Jet (TEJ) versus (
   <bold class="bold">e</bold>) convective and (
   <bold class="bold">f</bold>) large-scale Sahel rainfall in mm/day. The AEJ (TEJ) position is defined as the maximum easterly velocity at the 600 (200) hPa level.
