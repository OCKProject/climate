  <p class="p">Anomaly correlation as function of the time lag (days) between an Atlantic Cold Tongue (ACT) index (SST anomalies averaged over 20°W-12°E, 5°S-5°N) and the time series of WAM onset date anomalies. Time periods used for the correlation analysis are the years 1983–2014 for the observations, 80 (28) model years for the coupled (uncoupled) KCM integrations and all available years for the CMIP5 models. (
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>) The x-axis shows the number of days by which the ACT index is leading the WAM onset. Thick parts of the lines indicate significance of the Spearman rank order correlation coefficient at the 99% level. Shading indicates the range of all CMIP5 models. (
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>) Scatter plot of the interannual variability of the ACT index (average of months MJJ minus annual-mean) against the anomaly correlation coefficient at a 44 day lead of the ACT index (highest observed correlation). The red line shows a simple linear regression model including all 32 data sets together with the corresponding squared Pearson correlation coefficient (r
   <sup class="sup">2</sup>) and the p-value of the null hypothesis using a t-test.
