  <p class="p">Time-latitude (Hovmöller) diagrams of 14-day smoothed daily precipitation zonally averaged from 10°W to 10°E in mm/day. The thin grey contours have an interval of 2 mm/day. The thick black (red) line indicates the core location of the African (Tropical) Easterly Jet defined as the latitude of maximum eastward velocity at 600 hPa (200 hPa) levels. Locations are only shown for days with core speeds larger than 6 m/s. Observations in (
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>) combine PERSIANN precipitation and ERA-Interim wind data. Results are shown on the individual model grids. The vertical dashed lines show the calculated mean onset dates of the WAM.
