<p class="p">In addition to helping clarify the limitations of phenology models, this work will provide valuable evidence for more complex species distribution models, such as CLIMEX (see: 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://climatemodel.net/climex.htm" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://climatemodel.net/climex.htm</ext-link>), which include stress indices based on species responses to cold, hot, wet and dry conditions. CLIMEX generates an ecoclimatic index that represents the year-round suitability for establishment. Factors, such as cold stress, are parameterised to reflect the likelihood of overwintering survival rather than the extent to which cool periods in summer can also limit the area of establishment. In addition to parameterisation based on published climatic responses, a key advantage of CLIMEX is the ability to infer parameters from the distribution of a pest. For species such as 
 <italic class="italic">B</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">tabaci</italic>, which is a complex of 28 cryptic species, the distribution of each member of the complex is poorly known making it difficult to apply this CLIMEX attribute. In this situation, phenology models, such as the ones used in this project, based primarily on climate response thresholds, are of greater utility.
