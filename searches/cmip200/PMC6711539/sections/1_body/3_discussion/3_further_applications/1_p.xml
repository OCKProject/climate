<p class="p">This study has focused on the application of climate indices for assessing the risk of establishment of

 <italic class="italic">tabaci</italic> in northern France and the UK. Such an in-depth comparison of climatic indices between areas of pest presence and absence outdoors to identify additional factors that may be responsible for limiting the potential area of pest distribution is almost unique in the history of pest risk analysis. It was made possible by a strong collaboration between teams of experts in climatology and pest risk analysis utilising continental-wide high-resolution climate datasets. The technique has a much wider application for using climate indices and high resolution daily data to model any pests in any country where traditional degree-day models do not match the observed situation. It is therefore recommended that such methods are adopted in other situations where forecasting the risks of pest establishment are complex and challenging.
