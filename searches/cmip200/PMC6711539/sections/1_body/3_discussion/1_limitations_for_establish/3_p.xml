It is unlikely, therefore, that this pest will establish outdoors in the UK under current climate conditions. The number of consecutive cold days in summer is also greater in the UK than in the south of France (~20 days per months for the UK as compared to &lt;5 days per month for southern France; see Fig G in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0221057.s001" class="xref">S1 Appendix</xref>). This presents a further risk, as chilling injury is more likely to occur the longer an invertebrate is exposed to low temperatures [
