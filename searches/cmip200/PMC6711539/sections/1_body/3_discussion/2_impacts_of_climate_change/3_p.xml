<p class="p">Our study suggests that 
 <italic class="italic">B</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">tabaci</italic> could establish outdoors in East Anglia and across southern England in the future, which would make eradication of outbreaks in future more challenging than the current situation, where outbreaks are confined to glasshouses. Given the crucial need for an early warning system against 
 <italic class="italic">B</italic>. tabaci, we have identified that key indices for 
 <italic class="italic">B</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">tabaci</italic> survival and development in summer change gradually with increasing latitude (northwards from areas of France with a Mediterranean climate). This means that monitoring any possible northwards spread of 
 <italic class="italic">B</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">tabaci</italic> populations outdoors in France should also provide an important indicator of any change in the risks of outdoor populations of this species developing in the UK.
