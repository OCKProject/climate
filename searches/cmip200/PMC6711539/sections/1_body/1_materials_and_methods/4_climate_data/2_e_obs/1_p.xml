<p class="p">E-Obs was developed for the purpose of regional climate model evaluation. E-Obs version 14.0 provides daily gridded precipitation, temperature and sea level pressure data for land areas only, covering the period January 1950 to August 2016. The data are generated by interpolating monthly values using a thin-plate spline method and then interpolating the daily anomalies of the 11348 stations’ data using a global kriging method. Station coverage is denser in the UK than France for both precipitation and temperature. Annual average standard error for mean temperature across all of Europe over the period of this present study is ~0.69°C for years prior to 2000, rising to over 0.7°C subsequently due to a marked drop off in the number of stations [
