<p class="p">The future time periods considered are identified by Global Warming Levels (GWLs)—identified as mitigation targets in the Paris Agreement—which are set at a global annual mean rise of 1.5, 2 and 4°C relative to the pre-industrial climate (1861–1880). The central year of GWL1.5, GWL2 and GWL4 for each ensemble member is defined as the year in which the 20-year running mean of the global annual mean temperature anomaly first passes the specific temperatures of 1.5, 2, and 4°C respectively. The temperature anomaly is calculated relative to the pre-industrial period: defined as the mean of 1861–1880. The bias-corrected central GWL years are calculated assuming the observed warming from the pre-industrial period to the bias correction reference period (1861–1880 mean to 1981–2010 mean) is 0.61°C [
