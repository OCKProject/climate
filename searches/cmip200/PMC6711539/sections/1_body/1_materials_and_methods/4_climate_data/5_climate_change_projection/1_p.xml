 <xref rid="pone.0221057.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. To reduce computation time, the model was run in atmosphere-only mode rather than fully coupled atmosphere-ocean mode. This was achieved by using fixed sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and sea-ice concentrations (SICs) from different driving models run at a lower resolution as part of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP-5; [

 <xref rid="pone.0221057.t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>), chosen in the HELIX project as representative of the full model projections spread. The climate model data has been bias-corrected relative to the Princeton Global Forcings V2 reanalysis data product [
 <xref rid="pone.0221057.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>] according to the ISI-MIP bias correction protocol [
 <xref rid="pone.0221057.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. The CMIP-5 models were forced with the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 greenhouse gas emissions scenario from 1979–2100. This scenario is consistent with ongoing high emissions and hence features a rapid rate of warming.
