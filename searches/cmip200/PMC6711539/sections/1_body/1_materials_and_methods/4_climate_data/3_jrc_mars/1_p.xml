<p class="p">JRC-MARS (Joint Research Center-Monitoring Agricultural ResourceS) data was developed by AGRI4CAST to provide crop production information to the European Commission [
 <xref rid="pone.0221057.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. For this reason, the data are designed to be representative depictions of the weather in a typical agricultural holding within each grid cell, and therefore the median altitude of the non-irrigated arable land within the grid cell is chosen. JRC-MARS version 1.0 provides daily gridded temperature, wind speed, vapour pressure, precipitation, potential evaporation and evapotranspiration, radiation and snow depth data for land areas only, covering the period 1975 to present. Most of the data are generated by calculating the average of the daily data from up to the four most suitable weather stations for each grid cell from the ~9450 total stations; precipitation is taken directly from the single most suitable station identified. Suitable stations are identified according to a similarity score based on the distance, altitude difference, distance to coast and distance to uniform weather regions between the station and the grid cell centre. For the 7 weather stations most similar to the grid cell centre, a set score for all possible combinations of 1 up to 4 of these weather stations is determined, and the highest scoring set used in the interpolation. For temperature and vapour pressure parameters, the data are then corrected for altitude differences between the station and the grid cell centre using a moist adiabatic lapse rate of -0.006Â°Cm
