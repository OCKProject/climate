 <xref rid="pone.0221057.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>], a detailed study of the literature was undertaken to select the most appropriate temperature thresholds. Temperature thresholds extracted from the literature are given in

 <italic class="italic">tabaci</italic> biotype, but also depend on the host plant and even the variety, as summarised by [
