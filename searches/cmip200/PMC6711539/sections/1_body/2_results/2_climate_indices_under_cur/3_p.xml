 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221057.g004" class="xref">Fig 4A and 4B</xref> clearly show that there is a strong gradient across France in the number of days as cold as the coldest 10% of days and nights in Mediterranean France, but quite a flat profile across the UK. The indices incorporating user-defined thresholds, although not the most significantly different between regions, are informative. Mid- to southern France spends more than 80% of the summer months in conditions optimal for 
 <italic class="italic">B</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">tabaci</italic> development (temperature during egg to adult &gt; 15°C), but there is a sharp decline in the time spent in optimal conditions for development across northern France and into the UK from south to north (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221057.g004" class="xref">Fig 4C</xref>). Similarly, mid- and southern France experience the greatest amount of time in conditions optimal for survival (temperature &gt; = 20°C and &lt; = 30°C), but the amount of time diminishes in northern France and into the UK (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221057.g004" class="xref">Fig 4D</xref>). The UK experiences only a very small amount of time in conditions optimal for 
 <italic class="italic">B</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">tabaci</italic> survival (&lt;15% of time during the summer months). However, the results also show that, even in Mediterranean France, conditions are only optimal for 
 <italic class="italic">B</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">tabaci</italic> survival for 40–60% of the time during these warmest months. This may contribute to the low number of outdoor observations as compared to Crete where outdoor populations of whitefly are a very serious problem [
 <xref rid="pone.0221057.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. The corresponding values for Crete—amount of time in conditions optimal for survival (temperature &gt; = 20°C and &lt; = 30°C)—using the same methodology as for the UK and France, is 70% of the time during June-August for the whole island.
