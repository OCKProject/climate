 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221057.g003" class="xref">Fig 3B and 3C</xref> show that, on average, MEAM1 and MED should have enough accumulated day-degrees in the present climate (1986–2015) to complete one generation over England, Wales and much of Scotland. Two generations are predicted in much of southern and central England. Only in parts of the Scottish Highlands and associated Islands are there areas which are unsuitable for even one generation to be completed. Whereas the alternative parameters for MEAM1 [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221057.g003" class="xref">Fig 3A</xref>, indicate that one generation could occur everywhere, with at least 3 generations being possible in southern and central England. The thresholds used for MED were the higher of the values reported (refer to 
 <xref rid="pone.0221057.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Mapping these means the UK was depicted as less favourable than the other set of thresholds would imply. Given these less favourable data still show that much of the UK is theoretically suitable for 1–2 generations per year, this increased our confidence that at least some parts of the UK would be suitable for outdoor establishment. Choosing the lower threshold from [
 <xref rid="pone.0221057.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>] would make the UK appear more favourable still.
