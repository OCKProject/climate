<p class="p">The Committee on Climate Change Adaptation Sub-Committee [
 <xref rid="pone.0221057.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>] has identified new and emerging animal and plant pests and diseases as one of the principal climate change risks and key research priorities for the UK. This is because future climate change may allow pests and pathogens to survive better over winter in the UK and extend their current range, and once a pest or pathogen has established, they become difficult to eradicate [
 <xref rid="pone.0221057.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Risk management strategies therefore rely on early warning systems and surveillance to identify these pests and pathogens as soon as possible.
