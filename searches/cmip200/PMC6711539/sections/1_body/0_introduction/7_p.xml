<p class="p">To explain the inability of 
 <italic class="italic">B</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">tabaci</italic> to establish outdoors in the UK and the north of France during the summer, various hypotheses were tested. One explanation is that the whitefly does not experience enough accumulated warmth to complete its life cycle. Accumulated degree-day models can be used to determine whether there are sufficient degree-days above a minimum threshold for the development of the insect to complete its lifecycle [
 <xref rid="pone.0221057.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. Outputs of these models were mapped to show the locations where the whitefly could complete its lifecycle and the number of generations that could be completed. Alternatively, a second explanation is that other climate indices, such as climate variability and temperature extremes, may impact the whitefly, and these climate indices were compared between the UK and southern France.
