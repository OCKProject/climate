   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221057.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>. Latitudinal averages are constructed by excluding the Central Massif, the Alps, the Pyrenees, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland from the datasets as high elevations are likely to hinder whitefly colonisation. The indices for the number of days in the month meeting each condition were converted to percentage of the month by dividing by the number of days in each month and multiplying by 100.
