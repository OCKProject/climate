   <bold class="bold">Latitudinal transect showing the percentage of month (A: June, B: July, C: August) available for optimal survival conditions (&gt; = 20°C AND &lt; = 30°C) under the three global climate warming levels (GWL) of 1.5, 2 and 4°C above preindustrial conditions.</bold> The left-hand panels show the transects through France and the right-hand panels show the transects through the United Kingdom. The vertical shaded bars correspond to the regions for Mediterranean France and East Anglia as shown in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221057.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>. Latitudinal averages are constructed by excluding the Central Massif, the Alps, the Pyrenees, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland from the datasets as high elevations are likely to hinder whitefly colonisation. The indices for the number of days in the month meeting each condition were converted to percentage of the month by dividing by the number of days in each month and multiplying by 100.
