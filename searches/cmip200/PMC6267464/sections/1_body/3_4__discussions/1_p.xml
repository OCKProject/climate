<p class="p">The future extreme precipitation and flood variation of the JRB were analyzed in this study. Predominantly, an increase of projected extreme precipitation and flood has been informed by the GCMs. Most of these findings are consistent with previous studies. Both Huang et al. and Zhang et al. found an increasing trend in extreme precipitation indices in the upper Yangtze reaches [

 <xref rid="B43-ijerph-15-02491" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. Su et al. found an increase of 0.3 to 13.1% for peak discharge in the upper Yangtze River Basin during 2036 to 2065 [

The study of Gu et al. also showed that flood frequency and magnitude in the upper Yangtze River Basin are likely to increase significantly in the future. The AMX1d and AMX7d with return periods of 50, 20 and 10 years may turn into hydrological extreme events with return periods of approximately 15, 7 and 3 years [
