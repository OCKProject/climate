<p class="p">This research studied the projected extreme precipitation and flood variation of the JRB in RCP4.5 (medium) and RCP8.5 (high) scenarios based on five CMIP5 GCMs. The XAJ model was employed to simulate daily discharge, using 0.5° × 0.5° grid cells across the JRB for the baseline (1961 to 1990) and for the future period (2020 to 2050). Six extreme indices (AMX
