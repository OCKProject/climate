<p class="p">This research is a preliminary assessment of future extreme precipitation and flood in the JRB. Although uncertainties unavoidably exist in the projections, the results should be taken with care because the extreme floods of the JRB would be likely to become more frequent and intense in the next several decades. Furthermore, combining this research with the existing hydraulic engineering conditions, potential submerged area caused by extreme flood could be simulated. Then, the affected inhabitants, buildings and agricultural land could be identified, so as to provide scientific support for the drawing of flood risk map in the context of climate change.</p>
