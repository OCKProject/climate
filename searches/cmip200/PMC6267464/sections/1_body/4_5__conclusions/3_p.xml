<p class="p">As expected, extreme precipitation indices derived from precipitation projections of the GCMs for JRB exhibit a wide range of possible changes. The average AMX

 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 2% and 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 5%) across the JRB were projected to increase by 1.0â€“33.7% during 2020 to 2050. However, in different combination of climate models and scenarios, extreme precipitation showed a unanimous increasing trend, indicating that extreme precipitation will occur more frequently and more severe in the JRB in the future. According to the extreme precipitation projection revealed in this research, the Upper basin may suffer from the largest increase in extreme precipitation. This phenomenon may be caused by the melting and evaporation of glacier in the mountain area of Yangtze River source region due to global warming.
