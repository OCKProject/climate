<p class="p">The projection of extreme floods indicates that AMX1d, AMX3d and AMX7d showed very similar trends during the near future periods (2020–2050). The largest percentage increases in AMX
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>d were found for the RCP8.5 scenario of IPSL-CM5A-LR in 2020–2050, whereas the AMXnd will increase slightly and may even decrease for the RCP4.5 scenario of MIROC-ESM-CHEM. There is a relatively large variability in the projected ranges of AMX
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>d under the different future climate change scenarios. However, most of scenarios projected an increase during the near future periods (compared to the baseline 1961 to 1990). Overall, the percentage changes in AMX1d, AMX3d and AMX7d under 50-year return period ranged from −6.2 to 20.1%, −1.6 to 21.4% and 3.6 to 28.2%, respectively.
