<p class="p">Statistics like means and standard deviations in monthly, seasonal or yearly scales have been extensively applied to evaluate the ability of climate models. However, the biases or systematic errors identified in daily and peak data may be hidden in long averages (e.g., month, season and year). Moreover, means and standard deviations have limitations in representing the entire data distribution characteristic. A GCM might perform well in a mean value simulation, however, this does not mean it can capture other attributes [

If a GCM can simulate an entire PDF, this demonstrates its capability to simulate both extreme and common values, and thus, we might have more confidence in projections provided by this model [
 <xref rid="B16-ijerph-15-02491" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. Perkins et al. have carried out a simple method (skill score) to describe the relative similarity between model and observed PDFs. It is clearer, more robust and reliable than classical statistical tests. Different variables can be directly compared using this method [

This research mainly focuses on the impact of climate change on flood; thus, the simulation capacity of GCMs on extreme precipitation is the key factor in determining the reliability of the whole research. Hence, PDF-based assessment was used to assess different climate models.
