<p class="p">Water resources in the Jinsha River Basin (JRB) are distributed unevenly in both the temporal and spatial scale, which results in frequent floods occurring in wet season. Additionally, the extreme precipitation is expected to increase in the future [

 <xref rid="B19-ijerph-15-02491" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>], which may lead to higher risk of flood. It is of great importance to investigate the effects of climate change on extreme floods in this region. Thus, this research takes the JRB as the study area. A PDF-based assessment method was utilized to select the relatively optimal GCMs. With the aid of climate models and a hydrologic model, future changes of extreme precipitation and floods in the context of climate change were projected. This research will provide the policymakers with scientific proof on changes in flood, so as to make decisions on the change of magnitudes of design floods.
