<p class="p">Flooding is a climate-related disaster. Between 1980 and 2013, economic losses caused by floods have exceeded $1 trillion (2013 values). Over this same period, more than 220,000 people have lost their lives [

Additionally, warmer climate will bring about high atmospheric moisture content, which will further lead to the increase of extreme precipitation events [
