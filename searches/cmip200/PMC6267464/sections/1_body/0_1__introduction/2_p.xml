<p class="p">Most of the research on climate change impact use models for exploring ‘what-if’ questions. The main train of the research on flood risk management in regional climate change impact assessment is to do assessment of the impact of climate change on extreme precipitation and extreme streamflow with the aid of general circulation models (GCMs) output [

In order to make the coarse scale GCM data become suitable for hydrological simulation during this process, methods such as bias correction and statistical or dynamic downscaling have been brought in. Each step of the regional climate change impact assessment of flood may bring out uncertainty. Uncertainty will result from different GCMs, hydrological models, bias correction and downscaling methods. Previous studies have found that most of the uncertainty comes from the climate models and future emission scenarios. Unfortunately, this kind of uncertainty is innate and inevitable [

As a result, during the research of vulnerability and adaptation to climate change, the selection of climate models and emission scenarios should be treated integrally. A suite of GCMs has been provided by the Fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). Scenarios describe how Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions could evolve until 2100, depending on various hypotheses. In 2014, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published the AR5, in which a new set of scenarios was defined: the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). Although the uncertainly brought about by emission scenarios is innate and cannot be avoided, the same phenomena and consistent trend can be illustrated by most climate models. Moreover, the realization and structure of different GCMs will carry a certain amount of uncertainty [
