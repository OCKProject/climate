Take the 50-year return period as an example: the AMX1d, AMX3d and AMX7d would increase by 12.9%, 15.0% and 16.3%, respectively, in the Pingshan Station. The decrease of AMX1d and AMX3d were found for the RCP4.5 scenario of MIROC-ESM-CHEM in the Pingshan Station (−6.2% in AMX1d and −1.6% in AMX3d for the 50- year return period). AMX

When considering the results in RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios of the two relatively optimal GCMs, the range of relative changes in Pingshan were described as follows. For AMX1d, the relative changes ranged from 0.8 to 19.9% for the 20-year return period and from −6.2 to 20.1% for the 50-year return period. For AMX3d, the relative changes ranged from 2.9 to 19.9% for the 20-year return period and from −1.6 to 21.4% for the 50-year return period. For AMX7d, the relative changes ranged from 9.0 to 23.8% for the 20-year return period and from 3.6 to 28.2% for the 50-year return period.
