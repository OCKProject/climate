 <italic class="italic">n</italic>d in Pingshan, which can be used to compare the frequency of extreme floods between baseline and future periods. An increase trend has been detected in most climate change scenarios when frequency was less than 10%. However, in the same frequency range, variation of AMX
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>d projected by IPSL-CM5A-LR and MIROC-ESM-CHEM showed a significant difference. In RCP4.5, AMX
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>d projected by IPSL-CM5A-LR varied between 12 to 17%, while AMX1d, AMX3d and AMX7d projected by MIROC-ESM-CHEM were −12 to 6%, −5 to 6% and 8 to 9% respectively. When the frequency was less than 2%, AMX1d and AMX3d showed a decreasing trend; in RCP8.5, AMX
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>d projected by both IPSL-CM5A-LR and MIROC-ESM-CHEM showed an increasing trend; 18 to 30% and 0 to 15%, respectively.
