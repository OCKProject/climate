 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-02491-f007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref>). Thus, the spatial difference of extreme precipitation in different combined condition of GCMs and RCPs can be quantitatively described (longer box means bigger difference). It can be seen that in RCP4.5, spatial difference of extreme precipitation projected by IPSL-CM5A-LR was relatively small: extreme precipitation variation in grid-box ranges from 0 to 15%. While the spatial difference of extreme precipitation projected by MIROC-ESM-CHEM was relatively big: extreme precipitation variation in grid-box ranges from 10% to 35%; in the meantime, the precipitation variation was bigger than that projected by IPSL-CM5A-LR. In RCP8.5, extreme precipitation variation projected by both IPSL-CM5A-LR and MIROC-ESM-CHEM will range from 5% to 25%.
