 <xref rid="B42-ijerph-15-02491" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. Hence, extreme precipitation events variations (AMX1p, AMX3p and AMX7p) from the reference period (1961 to 1990) and the projection period (2020 to 2050) were firstly analyzed. The calculation of relative change between simulated value in projection period and that in the reference period could illustrate the evolution trend, and thus, eliminate the impacts of systematic deviation caused by GCMs. Only the above selected optimal GCMs (IPSL-CM5A-LR and MIROC-ESM-CHEM) were utilized for the analysis of the future extreme precipitation, so as to reduce the uncertainty from the GCMs.

Among the four sub-basins of JRB, the upper basin will face the largest increase in AMX1p (14.4 to 56.3%) and AMX3p (13.9–53.9%) and AMX7p (18.0 to 50.1%). These results indicate that in the near 30 years, the JRB, especially the upstream basin, will suffer from intensified extreme floods.
