<p class="p">With the observed PDF and GCM PDF for each grid square during 1961 to 2000, the

 <italic class="italic">B</italic> over four sub-catchments (namely, the Upper basin, Yalong River Basin, Middle basin, Lower basin and the Jinsha River Basin) are illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-02491-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>. Although several variations exist among different models, the five GCMs in this study performed better in the Lower basin than that in the Middle and Upper basins and better for AMX3p and AMX7p than AMX1p. Compared to the other three GCMs, IPSL-CM5A-LR and MIROC-ESM-CHEM were capable of capturing the characteristics of extreme precipitation statistical distribution and average value, especially for AMX3p and AMX7p. Taking the AMX3p as an example, the average 
 <italic class="italic">SS</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">B</italic>) across the JRB for IPSL-CM5A-LR and MIROC-ESM-CHEM were 0.60 (0.25) and 0.67 (0.18), respectively, which were superior to the projection of other models. Based on the above analysis, the outputs that came from IPSL-CM5A-LR and MIROC-ESM-CHEM were chosen for the analysis of future extreme flood changes.
