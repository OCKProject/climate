<p class="p">In this study, five global climate models in the IPCC AR5 report were selected: GFDL-ESM2M, HADGEM2-ES, IPSL-CM5A-LR, MIROC-ESM-CHEM and NORESM1-M. Information of each GCM is listed in 
 <xref rid="ijerph-15-02491-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. Each of these models offers continuous daily-series data, including historical simulations and future projection simulations forced under RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5. These four RCP scenarios were named according to a possible range of global radiative forcing values in 2100 relative to pre-industrial values. It is assumed that the global radiative forcing will reach the highest point at ~3 W m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> before 2100. If this value declines to 2.6 W m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> by 2100, this corresponding scenario is RCP2.6; stabilizations without overshoot pathways to 6.0 and 4.5 W m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> at stabilization after 2100 means RCP6.0 and RCP4.5; if this value rockets up to 8.5 W m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> by 2100, the corresponding scenario is RCP8.5 [
 <xref rid="B22-ijerph-15-02491" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. The data was bias-corrected and resampled by the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISI-MIP, 
 <uri xlink:href="http://www.isi-mip.org" class="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.isi-mip.org</uri>). It covers the period from 1960 to 2099 on a horizontal grid with 0.5° × 0.5° resolution [
 <xref rid="B23-ijerph-15-02491" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. The data was bias-corrected to make sure the consistency of the long-term statistical characteristic of the whole data and the observed data from 1960–1999 [
 <xref rid="B24-ijerph-15-02491" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. This bias-correction method was specifically developed for this project to keep the absolute trends in temperature and relative trends in precipitation and the other variables [
 <xref rid="B25-ijerph-15-02491" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. There are 208 boxes in and around the JRB and the spatial resolution of data can meet the requirements of hydrological simulation in the JRB. Since this research is focusing on extreme precipitation and discharge, RCP4.5 (medium) and RCP8.5 (high) scenarios were chosen to project the extreme precipitation and discharge variation.
