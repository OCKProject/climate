<p class="p">Observed daily precipitation, minimum and maximum temperature data was collected from China’s Ground Precipitation 0.5° × 0.5° Gridded Dataset (V2.0) and China’s Ground temperature 0.5° × 0.5° Gridded Dataset (V2.0) (
 <uri xlink:href="http://data.cma.cn/" class="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://data.cma.cn/</uri>), which was provided by the National Meteorological Information Center (NMIC) of the China Meteorological Administration (CMA). This dataset was based on the daily observations from 1961 to the present at 2474 national meteorological stations over the Chinese mainland. Data assessment showed that the gridded value had high correlation and little error with observation; thus, the gridded value can be used to reflect the variations of precipitation and temperature. In this study, 208 grid cells covering the JRB were selected (
