<p class="p">The multi-day extreme precipitation and discharge indices, widely used in extreme events analyses [
 <xref rid="B38-ijerph-15-02491" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>], were selected to reflect extreme precipitation and flow in this study (
 <xref rid="ijerph-15-02491-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). One type of index measures the annual maximum amount of daily precipitation, such as AMX1p, AMX3p and AMX7p. Another type of index measures the maximum discharge in successive 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> days, such as AMX1d, AMX3d and AMX7d.
