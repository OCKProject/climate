<p class="p">Driven by the baseline, daily climatology and the projected future daily climate data sets coming from the relatively optimal GCMs, the calibrated XAJ model can output the simulated daily discharge in both baseline (1961 to 1990) and future period (2020 to 2050). With the parameterized GEV distribution in different periods, relative changes in AMX
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>p and AMX
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>d under the 20- and 50-year return period can be estimated and represent changes in discharge in the future.
