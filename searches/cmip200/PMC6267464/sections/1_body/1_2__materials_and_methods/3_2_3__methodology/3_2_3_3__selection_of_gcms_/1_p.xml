<p class="p">Coupled climate models were evaluated and relatively optimal GCMs were selected to do hydro-meteorological variability projection. The simulation of AMX1p, AMX3p and AMX7p in 208 cells of the JRB were evaluated based on probability density functions (PDFs). An alternative metric-skill score (
 <italic class="italic">SS</italic>) was defined to illustrate the similarity between two PDFs. The cumulative minimum value of two distributions of each binned value can be calculated with the 
 <italic class="italic">SS</italic>, which means the overlapping area between two PDFs. The skill score (
 <italic class="italic">SS</italic>) is greater than 0 and smaller than 1. When 
 <italic class="italic">SS</italic> is close to 1, it means that the simulated value fits perfectly with the observed value (

 <italic class="italic">SS</italic> is close to 0, it means the overlap between simulated value and observed value is negligible (
