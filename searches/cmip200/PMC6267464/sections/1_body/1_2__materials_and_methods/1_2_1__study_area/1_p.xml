<p class="p">The Jinsha River Basin (JRB, 90°30′–105°15′ E and 24°36′–35°44′ N) has a total area of 473,200 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>, which is about 26% of the total drainage area of the Yangtze River Basin [
 <xref rid="B20-ijerph-15-02491" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. The Jinsha River runs through four provinces and an autonomous region (namely, Qinghai, Tibet, Yunnan, Sichuan and Guizhou). Originating from the peak of east Geladan Snowy Mountain in the Tanggula Mountains, the Jinsha River flows through the Western Sichuan Plateau, Hengduan Mountains and Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau to the mountain area of Southwest Sichuan, with a total length of 3464 km [

According to the data set provided by Data Center for Resources and Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences (RESDC), the total population in the JRB area was about 24 million in 2010, of which about 6.6 million in the Sichuan Province, about 13.8 million in the Yunnan Province and about 0.8 million in the Guizhou Province. The population in Qinghai and Tibet is low. The average annual precipitation of the JRB is approximately 710 mm: the annual precipitation of the lower reaches is approximately 900–1300 mm. The middle and upper reaches are mountainous canyon regions with an average annual precipitation of 600–800 mm. The annual precipitation in the source area upstream is less than 200 mm. Precipitation is mainly concentrated from June to October, which accounts for about 75–85% of annual precipitation (wet season). The spatial distribution of the temperature is similar to the precipitation. The overall trend is increasing from upstream towards downstream and from northwest to southeast. The average annual temperature of the JRB area is below 0 °C (upper reach), approximately 5 °C (middle reach) and above 10 °C (lower reach), respectively. According to statistics of discharge time series of 1950–2011 at the Pingshan station, which can be considered as the controlling hydrologic station, the annual average runoff of the JRB is 143 billion m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>. The Jinsha River flooding along the mainstream is mainly caused by extreme precipitation over a long time period. Heavy rainfall mainly happens at the middle and lower reaches of the Jinsha River. Floods generally occur in late June to mid-October, and more frequently, from July to September.
