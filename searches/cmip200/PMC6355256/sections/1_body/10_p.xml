<p id="P14" class="p">Whether the effect of carbon fertilization on the global carbon sink is exaggerated in models is unclear due the lack of long-term experiments; there has been, however, evidence that the initial increase in photosynthesis rates observed in C3 plants (~97% of plant species) may actually reverse after 15â€“20 years

 </sup>. Additionally, many of the factors limiting carbon fertilization have large uncertainty associated with them or are not well represented in models, thus the magnitude of the land carbon sink presented here is likely too high. For example, many free-air CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> enrichment (FACE) studies have shown limited or no response to elevated [CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>] levels because of nutrient limitations
