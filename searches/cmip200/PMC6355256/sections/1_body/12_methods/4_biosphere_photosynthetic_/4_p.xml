<p id="P27" class="p">This observational analysis, based on global remote-sensing products, confirms the asymmetric relationship between photosynthetic activity and water availability, as well as the sharp drop at low water contents, qualitatively similar to the functional dependence of photosynthesis on soil moisture represented in the models. As a result, losses in photosynthesis due to dry anomalies are not compensated by a similar magnitude positive anomaly.</p>
