 </sup>, and designed to investigate land-atmosphere feedbacks along with climate change from 1950–2100. For each model, GLACE-CMIP5 simulations include: (1) a reference run (CTL) based on the CMIP5 historic run until 2005, and the high-emission business as usual Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenario thereafter, which accounts for both the indirect impacts of soil moisture and the direct impact of CO
