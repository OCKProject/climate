<p id="P17" class="p">The comparison of the CTL and ExpB allows us to assess the impacts on NBP of soil moisture variability, which during negative anomalies can cause vegetation water stress, resulting in reduced evapotranspiration, warmer temperatures and an increase in the ratio of autotrophic respiration (r
 <sub class="sub">a</sub>) to GPP. The comparison of ExpB and ExpA isolates the effects of long-term soil moisture changes, which can also induce vegetation water-stress, increases in temperature and the ratio of respiration to GPP if the vegetation cannot adapt quickly enough. NBP time series of a third experiment (set up identically to the CTL but without the effects of carbon fertilization) are examined for trends to ensure that our results are in carbon equilibrium. NBP includes the carbon fluxes due to net primary production, as well as the fluxes due to LULC.
