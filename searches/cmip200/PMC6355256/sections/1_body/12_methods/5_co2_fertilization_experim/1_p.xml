 <sub class="sub">2</sub>] equivalent to that of 1950â€“2100 in RCP8.5, the experimental setup between ESMFixclim1 and RCP8.5 has differences not only related to the CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration rate of increase, but also to the lack of LULC and aerosols. Due to these differences in setup, these figures are presented to show general NBP trends due to carbon fertilization, but the magnitudes reported should not be compared directly to the soil moisture results.
