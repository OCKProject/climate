<p id="P9" class="p">These reductions are due to the nonlinear response of vegetation carbon uptake to water stress: photosynthesis sharply drops off once an ecosystem becomes water limited in models, which is supported by observational data (
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref>). These carbon losses are not recovered during periods with a (similar amplitude) positive moisture anomaly. Indeed, dryness reduces evaporation and therefore surface cooling

 <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>) due to soil moisture-atmosphere feedbacks

 </sup>. These feedbacks further reduce photosynthesis through their effect on vegetation stomatal closure. While respiration also decreases with soil moisture (Extended Data Figs 
 <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>), the land-atmosphere increase in temperature increases the ratio of respiration to GPP (
 <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>), leading to an overall strong NBP reduction with soil moisture (
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>). In addition, NBP is further reduced by fires during hot and dry spells from the increased prevalence of dead litter from tree mortality and foliage loss as fire fuel
