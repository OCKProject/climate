<p id="P5" class="p">Here we demonstrate that the net biome productivity (NBP) response to soil moisture variability is not a zero-sum game. Reductions in NBP driven by strong dry soil moisture anomalies (through increased water stress, fire frequency and intensity, and heat stress) are not compensated by increased NBP under anomalously wet conditions. Additionally, drying soil moisture trends reduce future global NBP and can transition ecosystem types, thus storing less NBP (e.g. a forest to a grassland)
