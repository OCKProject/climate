Secondly, an ecosystem can have decreased NBP response due to the vegetation already being in a severely water stressed environment: in other words, the overall global drying trend in soil moisture shifts several ecosystems into arid conditions, which reduces the influence of soil moisture temporal variability on NBP. Thirdly, insufficient drought recovery time for an ecosystem can shift a forest ecosystem to a grassland (storing less carbon)
