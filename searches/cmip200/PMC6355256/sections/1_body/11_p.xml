<p id="P15" class="p">Based on our findings it appears critical to correctly assess and simulate the (nonlinear) dependence of GPP and NBP on soil moisture variability in ESMs, as well as the associated land-atmosphere feedbacks. However, most current models only include stomatal limitations on photosynthesis

By quantifying the critical importance of soil water variability for the terrestrial carbon cycle, our results highlight the necessity of implementing improved, mechanistic representations of vegetation response to water stress and land-atmosphere coupling in ESMs, to constrain the future terrestrial carbon flux, and better predict future climate.
