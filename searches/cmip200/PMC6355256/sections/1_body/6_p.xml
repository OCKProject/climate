There are large NBP reductions in seasonally dry climates (western United States and Central Europe), tropical savannas (Brazil, India and northern Australia), and semi-arid/monsoonal regions (the Sahel, South Africa and Eastern Australia) that are known to be water-limited ecosystems, and which have been shown to be the main drivers of interannual terrestrial CO
