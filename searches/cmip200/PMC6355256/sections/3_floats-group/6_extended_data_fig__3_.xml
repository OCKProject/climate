  <p id="P45" class="p">The multi-model GLACE-CMIP5 mean correlations for the CTL run between soil moisture and VPD in the baseline (1971–2000) (

   <bold class="bold">b</bold>) periods. The correlation between monthly Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) total water storage (TWS) data (i.e. the sum of soil moisture and groundwater, surface water, snow and ice) and Atmospheric Infrared Sensor (AIRS) VPD data for the period of 2007–2016 (
   <bold class="bold">c</bold>). Monthly growing season data are used, defined by a SIF (observations) or GPP (models) value greater than half of the maximum climatology per pixel, and seasonal cycles were removed prior to performing the correlations.
