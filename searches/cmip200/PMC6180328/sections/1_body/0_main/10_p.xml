 </sup>. Here we use direct observations to isolate the functional response of vegetation cover to temperature in temperature-limited regions and report an observed greening consistent with the effect of long-term temperature changes. The identified temperature sensitivity shows that growing season warmth is a dominant factor for vegetation production in cold regions, confirming previous reports of temperature controls on both spatial and temporal vegetation dynamics

 </sup>. Our analysis also suggests a large reduction in ecosystem temperature limitation under future warming, though other limitations will likely play a large role in mediating the extent to which high-latitude ecosystems green. For example, arctic tundra soils are nutrient poor and, through stoichiometric requirements, impose limits on potential biomass, although mineralization of previous frozen soil N may

 </sup> offset those limitations. Similarly, the waterlogged soils of extensive northern wetlands are unsuitable for dense vegetation, regardless of the temperature limitation. Other limitations include the limited ability of species to migrate and adapt to the distinct environmental conditions of high-latitude ecosystems
