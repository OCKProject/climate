 <sub class="sub">max</sub> has declined by 16.35 ± 0.64% over the observational record. The release from temperature limitations was largely experienced at the southern edge of high-latitude ecosystems. We estimate 45% and 85% reductions in the temperature-limited area by 2100 for CMIP5 ensemble warming projections under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively (
