 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> due to observed changes in temperatures, we show a long-term increase in foliage cover that is consistent with the expected influence of recent warming. The observed greening occurred together with a large decline in the spatial extent of temperature limitation over recent decades, in particular for northern high-latitude ecosystems. Finally, we use an ensemble of global Earth System Models (ESMs) from the recent Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) to examine the impact of future projected temperature changes on the spatial extent of temperature limitation, and to assess ESM skill in estimating the sensitivity of maximum foliage cover to changes in temperature.
