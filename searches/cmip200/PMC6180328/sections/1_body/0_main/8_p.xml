 </sup>, thus allowing for the identification of the independent temperature sensitivity. In reality, however, multiple factors limit maximum vegetation cover in cold regions, including nutrient availability, rooting depth, permafrost dynamics, and soil moisture. We estimate that 44% of the vegetated land surface identified as temperature-limited is primarily temperature-limited, defined as being within ±10% of the potential

This proportion suggests that the vegetation cover response to warming of the remaining 56% will likely be mediated by other factors. Indeed, the mean long-term increase in maximum vegetation cover for vegetated areas that are primarily temperature-limited was 1.48 ± 0.05 % decade
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (mean ± std. error), whereas vegetated areas limited by both temperature and other factors had smaller increases of 0.8 ± 0.03 % decade
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. The predicted declines in the temperature-limited area therefore do not necessarily translate into a uniform increase in vegetation cover. For instance, warming also extends the growing season length, which may lead to earlier snow-melt, increase peak season water stress, and thus reduce vegetation cover
