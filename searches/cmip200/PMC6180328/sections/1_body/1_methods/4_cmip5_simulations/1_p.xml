The land components of these ESMs differ in their representations of vegetation types, soil properties, human disturbances, and carbon and nitrogen pools. We used model output of leaf area and air temperature at native spatial resolution, and converted to the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation using the standard conversion of Beer’s law, which accounts for the exponential decline in absorbed radiation with increasing leaf area. Values of
