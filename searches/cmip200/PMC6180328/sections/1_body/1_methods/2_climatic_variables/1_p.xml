 </sup>. The monthly mean air temperature values were converted to annual values of summer warmth by summing all monthly temperature values above a baseline of 5 °C (SWI
 <sub class="sub">5</sub>). This approach is designed to account for changes in temperatures that effect vegetation growth, whilst minimizing changes in temperatures that are too low to influence vegetation. Using a base temperature of 0 °C (SWI
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>) led to the inclusion of low temperature and low fAPAR pixels that were relatively insensitive to temperature change, but did not affect the overall results (
