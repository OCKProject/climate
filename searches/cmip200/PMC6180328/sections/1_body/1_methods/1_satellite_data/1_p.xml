<p id="P14" class="p">We used estimates of the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR) from the Global Inventory Modelling and Mapping Studies third-generation fAPAR data product (GIMMS3g

  <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>
 </sup>), available for the period 1982–2012. The data set is provided biweekly at 0.083° spatial resolution and was regridded to match the spatial resolution of the climate data. Maximum annual fAPAR (
