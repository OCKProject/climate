The breakpoint of the regression identifies the region where the vegetation–temperature relationship plateaus and vegetation ceases to be temperature-limited. Note that the breakpoint temperature was relatively insensitive to the percentile used (
 <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">Fig S7</xref>). We constructed time series of the slopes and intercepts of the breakpoint regression and determined linear trends for both variables, using changes in the

 <sub class="sub">5</sub> fixed to that experienced in the first three-year window of the observational record (1982–1984). As running means were used to construct the time series, non-independent running mean blocks were removed before determining the strength and significance of trends.
