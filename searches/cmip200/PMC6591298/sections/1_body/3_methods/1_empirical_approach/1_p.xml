 </sup> (temperature), with a large set of future changes in income and temperatures. In the first step, we combine the income elasticities with population and GDP projections from the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) to construct five scenarios of baseline global energy demand in 2050 without climate-change impacts. In the second step, we impose climatic shocks derived from 21 Earth System Models and 2 emission scenarios (RCPs) on top of the baseline scenarios by combining temperature elasticities with the 2050 present difference in spatial population and hot and cold days from the current mean climate.
