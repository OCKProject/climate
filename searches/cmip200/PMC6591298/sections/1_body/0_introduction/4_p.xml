 </sup>. These intervening adjustments ultimately drive the economic impacts, such as changes in household incomes and welfare. Their scale and scope depend on future changes in structural, technological, and market characteristics that top–down, empirically based approaches imperfectly reflect, and that can be better analyzed using IAM or CGE frameworks
