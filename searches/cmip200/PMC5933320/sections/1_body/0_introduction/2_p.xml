<p class="p">The amplification effect evident in endorheic watersheds makes them important for detection of regional changes in climate, because even relatively small changes in local temperature and precipitation extended over years leads to highly visible changes in water level and lake area, imposing a direct impact on the livelihood of lake-dependent populations. 
 <xref rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kharel &amp; Kirilenko (2015)</xref> provided numerous examples of closed lakes across the globe with receding (e.g., Aral Sea, Lake Chad, and Qinghai Lake) or rising (e.g., Caspian Sea and Mar Chiquita) waters related to changing climate and land use (see also 
 <xref rid="ref-42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Rosenzweig et al., 2007</xref>). While endorheic lakes most commonly experience receding water level due to human activities, DL, located in a sparsely populated Northern Great Plains area close to the USâ€”Canada border (United States Geological Survey (USGS) Souris-Red-Rainy drainage region, see
