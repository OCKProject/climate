<p class="p">In this paper, we used the 2013 CMIP-5 IPCC climate projections (
 <xref rid="ref-50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Stocker et al., 2013</xref>) to update the earlier projections of DL flood risks. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of outlet-based flood mitigation strategy in DL under the projected changes in CMIP5 precipitation and temperature and compare those new results to the earlier CMIP-3 projections. This work will provide better scientific support for management decisions by taking the latest climate change science into consideration.
