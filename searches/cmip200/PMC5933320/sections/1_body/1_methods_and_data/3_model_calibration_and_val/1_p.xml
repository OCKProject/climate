<p class="p">Model performance was evaluated by comparing the SWAT simulated daily streamflow with the observations from the seven USGS stream gage stations within the watershed for the period of 1991–2010. Since not all the stations had continuous data available for the entire time period, model calibration and validation were carried for different time intervals for different stations. The 1991–2010 period was selected for model calibration and validation to capture the nonlinear dynamics of DL during this time period when the lake level rose dramatically. The automatic calibrator SWAT-CUP (
 <xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Abbaspour, 2011</xref>) was used for model calibration, validation, and sensitivity analysis. The Latin hypercube parameter sampling method (
 <xref rid="ref-32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">McKay, Beckman &amp; Conover, 2000</xref>) in SWAT-CUP was used to identify the parameters that were most sensitive to the model. We found that the parameters related to snow (SFTMT, SMTMP, SMFMX, SMFMN, TIMP, SNOCOVMX), evapotranspiration (ET) (ESCO, EPCO, EVRSV), water routing (CH_N2, CH_N1, ALPHA_BNK), surface runoff (CN
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, SURLAG), and groundwater (ALPHA_BF) were the most sensitive (
