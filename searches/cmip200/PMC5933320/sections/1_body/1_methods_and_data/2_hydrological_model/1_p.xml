<p class="p">The hydrological model of the DL watershed was developed using the SWAT modeling framework (
 <xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Arnold et al., 1998</xref>). The DL watershed was delineated using a 10 m resolution digital elevation model (DEM) (

A stream network extracted from the USGS National Hydrography Dataset was burned-in to the DEM to divide the watershed into 12 sub-basins with the associated topographic characteristics. A crop layer (
 <xref rid="ref-52" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">USDA-National Agricultural Statistics Cropland Data Layer, 2008</xref>) was used to derive land use coverage for each sub-basin. The watershed is comprised of 13 different land uses with agriculture (spring wheat, soybeans, corn, canola, barley, beans, and alfalfa) occupying nearly 65% of the watershed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>). Soil information in the watershed was obtained from the soil survey geographic database—SSURGO (
 <xref rid="ref-47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Soil Survey Staff, Natural Resources Conservation Service, United States Department of Agriculture, 2018</xref>). The watershed was divided into two slope classes: 0–5% and greater than 5%. Then these land use types, and soil and slope classes, were overlaid to produce 156 unique hydrologic response units (HRU). Historical climatic condition in the watershed was represented by daily observations of precipitation and temperature data for four stations inside the watershed for 1981 to 2010 obtained from the USDA Agricultural Research Service database (

The model simulated water flow in each HRU, which was then integrated at the sub-basin and the entire watershed levels. DL’s water level change was estimated from the balance of lake inflows, lake evaporation, and water outflow from the lake’s artificial outlets.
