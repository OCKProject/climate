<p class="p">To correct GCM projections from the spatial resolution bias described above, we applied two stochastic weather generators; LARS-WG (
 <xref rid="ref-44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Semenov et al., 1998</xref>) and MarkSim (
 <xref rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Jones &amp; Thornton, 2013</xref>). These weather generators use the observed weather together with a GCM output to produce daily synthetic weather patterns representative of historical or future climates. Both LARS-WG and MarkSim have been utilized to downscale climate forecasts in studies worldwide; for example, MarkSim is included as a part of the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer family of crop yield models. Schematically, these weather generators are similar. First, wetâ€“dry day series are modeled using a Markov Chain (MarkSim) or a semi-empirical distribution (LARS-WG). Then, precipitation is distributed over the wet days. Finally, daily values of other weather variables are generated conditioned on precipitation (

 <xref rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Chen &amp; Brissette, 2014</xref>), possibly related to its semi-empirical distribution-based simulation of precipitation vs. the parametric distribution-based scheme frequently used in weather generators. MarkSim was used for the CMIP-5 ensemble, because LARS-WG had not been adapted to the CMIP-5 at the time of this research.
