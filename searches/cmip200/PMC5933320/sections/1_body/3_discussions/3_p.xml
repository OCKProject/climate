<p class="p">A long-term goal of the DL management team is to lower the DL water level to 441.35 m (1.2 m below the current level) via outlets (
 <xref rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">North Dakota State Water Commission, 2017</xref>), but this plan does not specify particular mitigation strategy in case of an emergency overspill. Current flood management mainly relies on diverting flood water to the nearby Sheyenne River via two artificial outlets, which greatly reduce DL overspill risks under the current climate. However, hydrologic modeling using the CMIP-5 GCM ensemble showed that the likelihood of lake overspill would be high even when the outlets run at their combined capacity of 17.0 m

 <xref rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Haley, 2014</xref>). Previous research found that running both outlets at their full-capacity would degrade the water quality of the Sheyenne River and also would violate the current North Dakota sulfate concentration water quality standard of 450 mg/l (
