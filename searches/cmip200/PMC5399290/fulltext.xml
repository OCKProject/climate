A significant decline in this resource has a direct connection to streamflow, with substantial economic and societal impacts. Observations and reanalyses indicate that between the 1980s and 2000s, there was a 10&#x02013;20&#x00025; loss in the annual maximum amount of water contained in the region's snowpack. Here we show that this loss is consistent with results from a large ensemble of climate simulations forced with natural and anthropogenic changes, but is inconsistent with simulations forced by natural changes alone. A further loss of up to 60&#x00025; is projected within the next 30 years. Uncertainties in loss estimates depend on the size and the rate of response to continued anthropogenic forcing and the magnitude and phasing of internal decadal variability. The projected losses have serious implications for the hydropower, municipal and agricultural sectors in the region.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="web-summary"><p>Mountain snowpack in the western United States has declined over the past three decades.

It is also well known that the region's climate is substantially influenced by decadal variability originating in the adjacent Pacific Ocean<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. In this study we employ observations, land surface reanalyses and climate model simulations to characterize the combined influences of decadal variability and external forcing on recently observed and near-term projected changes in snowpack over the western United States.</p><p>Recognition of the pronounced influence of decadal variability on regional trends in climate is motivating efforts to generate large initial condition ensembles of global climate model simulations. These ensembles provide estimates of the relative contributions of internal variability and external forcing to regional-scale climate changes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. An initial condition ensemble consists of many individual simulations performed with a given coupled climate model; each simulation uses the same external forcing, but is initiated from slightly different conditions of the atmosphere and/or ocean state. Each ensemble member has a different realization of internal variability superimposed on the underlying externally forced response.</p><p>Because of their high computational cost, large (&#x0003e;10-member) ensembles are rare. It is also rare for groups to perform multiple large ensembles, one consisting of simulations with anthropogenic forcing only, and one with simulations incorporating solar and volcanic forcing alone. Here, we generate and analyse 50-member anthropogenic and naturally forced ensembles. We also rely on a large ensemble of higher-resolution regional climate model simulations driven with the output from the global climate model.</p><p>Although several studies have found an anthropogenic contribution to snowpack loss over the western United States, the combined influences of decadal variability and external forcing remain poorly quantified in observations and near-term projections. In this study, we show that losses in regional snowpack over the past few decades are consistent with natural and anthropogenic changes, but are inconsistent with natural changes alone. We predict an additional loss of snowpack water storage of up to 60&#x00025; within the next three decades due to combined influences from anthropogenic forcing and internal decadal variability.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Observed snowpack loss</title><p>Observations of snow water equivalent (SWE) were acquired from the United States Natural Resource Conservation Service Snow Telemetry (SnoTel) network of automated snow pillow measurements across alpine sites. These measurements were taken from a quality-controlled data set discussed in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. We restrict our analysis to the post-1981 period since the number of observations before this time is too low to allow calculation of reliable regional averages. Monthly-mean (January-May) SnoTel observations are continuously available from 1982 to 2016 at 354 stations with elevations greater than 1,500&#x02009;m. A threshold of 1,500&#x02009;m provides good regional coverage; use of continuous observations avoids introducing temporal changes in spatial coverage. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref> shows that 307 of the 354 stations (or about 87&#x00025; of all stations) show a negative trend in annual maximum SWE (SWE<sub>max</sub>). The maximum loss typically occurs in April. Here and subsequently, SWE<sub>max</sub> is computed over 1982&#x02013;2010 to facilitate comparison with reanalysis-based estimates for the maximum period of overlap between the reanalyses and the SnoTel data (see below).</p><p>We first compute the climatology and trend in SWE<sub>max</sub>. Results are area-averaged over the 354 selected SnoTel stations. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref> shows that the climatology and trend are 4.6&#x02009;cm and &#x02212;0.33&#x02009;cm per decade, respectively. The trend has a <italic>P</italic> value less than 0.15. This decrease in SWE<sub>max</sub> represents about a 9.5&#x00025; loss; this is expressed as the per cent difference between the decadal averages of SWE<sub>max</sub> in 1982&#x02013;1992 and 2000&#x02013;2010 (the first and last decades of the period of maximum overlap). This multi-decade decline in regional snowpack is consistent with results from refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, despite the fact that these studies used different time periods, data sets and metrics. (The sensitivity to the metric used, for example, 1 April SWE or SWE<sub>max</sub>, has been discussed in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>.) Finally, we note that the accumulated SWE over the winter months is primarily controlled by snowfall. Significant losses in SWE are observed throughout the snowfall season (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>) and are not restricted to April, the month typically associated with SWE<sub>max</sub>.</p><p>We also consider a group of four gridded SWE data sets obtained from reanalysis products (hereafter referred to as REANAL4). These four data sets have been assessed in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> over the common period of availability from 1982 to 2010. Whereas the SnoTel measurements provide a purely observational perspective, the REANAL4 group has been produced using snow schemes of varying complexity embedded in land surface models forced by meteorological reanalyses. The following data sets were used: (1) the Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>); (2) the European Centre for Medium-Range Forecasts Interim Land Reanalysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>; (3) the Modern Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>; and (4) the Crocus snow scheme driven by ERA-Interim meteorology<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Differences between these data sets have been discussed at length in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. The SWE fields were re-gridded to a 1&#x000b0; longitude by 1&#x000b0; latitude grid; monthly mean SWE results were averaged across the four reanalyses.</p><p>Area averaging SWE<sub>max</sub> at elevations greater than 1,500&#x02009;m (north of 30&#x000b0;N and south of 50&#x000b0;N) yields a reanalysis-mean climatology and trend of 3.9&#x02009;cm and &#x02212;0.56&#x02009;cm per decade, respectively. The trend has a <italic>P</italic> value less than 0.01. This decrease in SWE<sub>max</sub> represents an &#x0223c;21.8&#x00025; loss between 1982&#x02013;1992 and 2000&#x02013;2010. The correlation between the SWE<sub>max</sub> time series from REANAL4 and SnoTel is 0.73. The range of climatology and trend estimates from the four reanalysis products encompasses the corresponding SnoTel estimates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). While this is encouraging, there are significant scale challenges in relating local SWE measurements to coarsely gridded snow reanalyses, and direct comparisons between the two must be approached cautiously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. The green bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref> show the uncertainties associated with the SnoTel values. Here, uncertainties are computed as &#x000b1;1 s.d. across 10,000 random samples of the SnoTel stations. In each case, a station is randomly selected and the average climatology and trend is computed across a random selection of no more than 10 of its neighbouring stations within 1&#x000b0; longitude and 1&#x000b0; latitude (the spatial resolution of the reanalyses). In short, the SnoTel and REANAL4 results are consistent within the uncertainties in each data source; this holds for both climatologies and trends.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Historical simulated snowpack loss</title><p>Our ensemble of model simulations was generated with the Canadian Earth System Model version 2 (CanESM2; see Methods and ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). Simulations include historical forcings from 1950 to 2005 and RCP8.5 forcing extensions after 2005. The RCP8.5 pathway is a high-emission scenario leading to an 8.5&#x02009;W&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> increase in radiative forcing by 2,100. Over the early part of the twenty-first century, forcing differences between RCP8.5 and other commonly analysed RCPs are relatively small<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Two 50-member ensembles were run with CanESM2, one with natural and anthropogenic forcings (ALL) and one with only natural forcings (NAT). Anthropogenic forcings include changes in well-mixed greenhouse gases, anthropogenic aerosols, tropospheric and stratospheric ozone, and land use. Natural forcings consist of changes in solar irradiance and volcanic aerosol loadings.</p><p>For the ALL ensemble, area-averaging the simulated SWE<sub>max</sub> at elevations greater than 1,500&#x02009;m (north of 30&#x000b0;N and south of 50&#x000b0;N) yields an ensemble-mean climatology and trend of 6.1&#x02009;cm and &#x02212;0.57&#x02009;cm per decade. The trend has a <italic>P</italic> value less than 0.001. The simulated trend is in good agreement with the average of the four reanalyses; the simulated climatology is at the high end of the reanalysis estimates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). The latter suggests greater climatological snowfall in the model than in reality, although this is difficult to assess given the absence of a reliable long-term observational record of winter precipitation. The simulated pattern of climatological SWE<sub>max</sub> is in reasonable agreement with the comparable field in reanalyses (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>), albeit with spatial detail given the coarser resolution of the global coupled model (which is nominally 2.8&#x000b0; longitude by 2.8&#x000b0; latitude).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4a</xref> shows 5-year mean anomalies of area-averaged SWE<sub>max</sub> at elevations greater than 1,500&#x02009;m. Results are from SnoTel (green), REANAL4 (pink) and the ALL simulations (black). We also show results obtained by dynamical downscaling of 35 members of the CanESM2 ALL ensemble and RCP8.5 continuation (dashed curve). Downscaling relied on the Canadian Regional Climate Model version 4 (CanRCM4), which has a nominal resolution of 50&#x02009;km (see Methods and ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). Downscaling was performed over the North American domain defined in the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. The similarity between the CanESM2 and CanRCM4 ensemble-mean time series (<italic>r</italic>=0.99) is evidence that the temporal variability of area-average SWE<sub>max</sub> from CanESM2 is relatively insensitive to an increase in spatial resolution.</p><p>Because there is only one realization of internal variability in the real world, we do not expect the CanESM2 ensemble-mean SWE<sub>max</sub> (which is averaged over many different model realizations of internal variability) to closely follow the time evolution of SWE<sub>max</sub> in the SnoTel data and REANAL4. The key point here is that the multi-decadal changes in SWE<sub>max</sub> are reasonably similar in SnoTel, REANAL4, and the CanESM2 and CanRCM4 ensembles under ALL forcing. Under NAT forcing, however, the CanESM2 ensemble mean does not replicate the observed decline in SWE<sub>max</sub> since the 1980s.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Detection and attribution analysis</title><p>We use a standard optimal fingerprinting method to address the causes of these SWE<sub>max</sub> changes. This involves regressing the observations onto the simulated ALL and NAT responses. The resulting values of the scaling factor <italic>&#x003b2;</italic> provide information on the extent to which the model SWE<sub>max</sub> responses must be scaled to best reproduce the observed SWE<sub>max</sub> changes. The method also yields the 90&#x00025; confidence intervals on <italic>&#x003b2;</italic> estimates (see Methods).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4b</xref> shows that with combined anthropogenic and natural forcings, CanESM2 reproduces the reanalysis and SnoTel SWE<sub>max</sub> changes, albeit with smaller magnitude&#x02014;that is, the scaling factors are significantly larger than 0 and less than (but still consistent with) 1. With natural forcings alone, however, the model does not reproduce the reanalysis and SnoTel changes. A similar result was obtained in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> using snow course data, observationally based precipitation, two earlier-generation climate models, two statistical downscaling approaches, and a late-twentieth-century analysis period (1950&#x02013;1999).</p><p>Since we do not have a CanESM2 ensemble with anthropogenic forcing only, we compute the anthropogenic scaling factor by linear regression of the reanalyses or observations onto the difference between the ALL and NAT responses (denoted by ANT). We assume additivity of the ANT and NAT SWE<sub>max</sub> responses. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4b</xref> shows that the estimated ANT SWE<sub>max</sub> changes: (1) are consistent with the reanalyses; (2) are detectable in the SnoTel observations but with significantly smaller magnitude; and (3) yield very similar <italic>&#x003b2;</italic> values to the ALL case. Regarding (2), when average SWE<sub>max</sub> is computed over the larger region encompassing elevations greater than 1&#x02009;km (in order to reduce the noise contribution inherent in point measurements) anthropogenic forcing more successfully reproduces the magnitude of the SnoTel changes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). While the results from this analysis provide clear evidence of an anthropogenic influence on snowpack water storage, it is difficult to more reliably quantify the magnitude of this influence given the relatively short observational SWE<sub>max</sub> record, the effects of underlying variability and the uncertainties inherent in our indirect estimate of the ANT SWE<sub>max</sub> response.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Near-term projected snowpack loss</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5a</xref> shows 5-year mean SWE<sub>max</sub> from the ALL ensemble, averaged at elevations greater than 1,500&#x02009;m. The first 5-year period is centred on 1988 and the last 5-year period is centred on 2038. The ALL ensemble uses the RCP8.5 forcing extension after 2005. The ensemble-mean response (black curve) shows a small increase in the rate of SWE<sub>max</sub> decline from the first half of the analysis period shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref> to the second half of the analysis period. More specifically, the externally forced trend in SWE<sub>max</sub> is about &#x02212;0.50&#x02009;cm per decade from 1988 to 2013 and about &#x02212;0.62&#x02009;cm per decade from 2013 to 2038. This increase in the rate of SWE<sub>max</sub> decline is significant at <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05, where significance is assessed using a standard difference of means test on the 50 simulated trends in the earlier period and the 50 simulated trends in the later period. As noted in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, distinguishing rates of change in externally forced response over small regions and short timescales, such as these, requires large ensembles of simulations (as shown here).</p><p>Our focus is on quantifying the combined contribution of internal variability and external forcing to near-term projected SWE<sub>max</sub>. The largest near-term loss in accumulated snowpack over the western United States is &#x0223c;60&#x00025;; this was calculated as the per cent change between averages over the 5-year periods centred on 2013 and 2038. The largest near-term gain is about 3&#x00025;. The substantial difference between these two percentage changes&#x02014;obtained with the same physical climate model, driven by the same external forcings&#x02014;underscores the potentially large contribution of decadal variability to regional-scale changes in SWE<sub>max</sub>, particularly on shorter (ca. 30-year) timescales. The range in projected snowpack reductions reflects the interplay between temperature and precipitation trends on the end of season SWE<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. Averaging over realizations reduces this variability, and provides a better estimate of the underlying response to external forcing, yielding about a 30&#x00025; loss of regional snowpack in the ALL ensemble mean.</p><p>We note that CanESM2 generally reproduces the large-scale wintertime patterns of decadal variability observed in Pacific sea surface temperature, precipitation, sea level pressure and North American surface temperature<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. This enhances our confidence in the credibility of the simulated decadal variations in snowpack loss. In comparison with other climate models participating in phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>), the magnitude of unforced decadal variability in SWE<sub>max</sub> in CanESM2 is in the bottom half of the multi-model ensemble (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). This suggests that the CanESM2 estimate of the influence of decadal variability on regional snowpack is conservative. Alternately, smaller decadal variability also has implications for the detection results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>, and may yield more liberal estimates of anthropogenic signal detectability.</p><p>We also compare the projections of regional SWE<sub>max</sub> changes in CMIP5 models and CanESM2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). Results are for changes in ensemble-mean simulated SWE<sub>max</sub> between the 5-year periods centred on 2013 and 2038; the minimum-to-maximum ranges are also indicated. The CMIP5 set consists of one ensemble member (r1i1p1) from each CMIP5 model with an ALL forcing historical simulation and corresponding RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 extension (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). The range associated with the CanESM2 initial condition ensemble (for ALL forcing and the RCP8.5 extension) solely reflects the influence of decadal variability. The ranges associated with the CMIP5 multi-model ensemble are indicative of both decadal variability and model uncertainty.</p><p>Although the &#x02018;spread' in these ensembles arises from different reasons, the message from this comparison is that the potential for large snowpack loss in the CanESM2 initial-condition ensemble is also evident in the CMIP5 multi-model ensemble, and is manifest across all three emissions scenarios.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Large-scale patterns associated with extreme snowpack loss</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6</xref> shows the sea level pressure and surface air temperature patterns associated with a large negative contribution to regional snowpack from decadal variability in the period from 2030 to 2040 as obtained from the CanESM2 ensemble. These patterns are indicative of a stronger than normal Aleutian Low. The Aleutian Low is a semi-permanent low pressure centre located near the Aleutian Islands during the winter. It is one of the main centres of action in the atmospheric circulation of the Northern Hemisphere. The circulation anomalies associated with the stronger than normal Aleutian Low are responsible for transporting anomalously warm and moist air over the western United States. The impact of warm air on regional snowpack is obvious (especially where temperatures are above or about the freezing point). The impact of increased precipitation on snowpack is generally more complex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>, but our model shows that the anomalous precipitation falls as rain rather than snow, therefore yielding a reduction in snowpack.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our analysis makes innovative use of a large ensemble of simulations. This ensemble was generated with the same climate model and external forcings, but with each ensemble member commencing from slightly different initial conditions. The ensemble provides estimates of the relative contributions of internal variability and external forcing to near-term loss of regional snowpack over the western United States. Over this region, and over a relatively short (ca. 30-year) time horizon, decadal variability may offset some of the anthropogenically forced loss in snowpack. Of greater concern, however, is that decadal variability has the potential to substantially enhance the near-term decline in snowpack expected in response to anthropogenic forcing. These reductions in snowpack water storage have broad implications for future forest productivity and carbon storage<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>, forest vulnerability to fire<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>, as well as streamflow and water supply<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>.

This parameterization employs a random number generator with a pre-set seed; the 50 individual simulations in each ensemble were based on different seeds. In this way, different climate change realizations were produced without any change to the model dynamics, physics or structure. The NAT simulations used observed estimates of historical changes in solar irradiance and volcanic aerosol loadings. The ALL simulations incorporate (in addition to solar and volcanic forcing) estimated historical changes in greenhouse gases, aerosols, ozone and land use. Both ALL and NAT simulations end in December 2004. The RCP8.5 scenario was used to extend the ALL simulations from January 2005 onwards.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Regional climate model simulations</title><p>These simulations were performed with the CanRCM4; (this has a nominal resolution of 50&#x02009;km; ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). An ensemble of 35 CanRCM4 simulations was driven (at the horizontal and lower boundaries of the regional model's domain) by daily output from the large initial-condition ensemble of global climate model simulations. Observed natural and anthropogenic forcings are identical to those employed in the global coupled climate model simulations.

The AER ensemble consists of 50 members with anthropogenic aerosol forcing only. The components considered include sulfate aerosols, organic aerosols and black carbon.

All the stations plotted here are at elevations greater than 1,500&#x02009;m.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ncomms14996-f1"/></fig><fig id="f2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Climatology and trend in area-average annual maximum snow water equivalent.</title><p>The green bars show snow telemetry (SnoTel) ranges (&#x000b1;1 s.d.) computed from random samples of stations from the SnoTel network (see main text).
