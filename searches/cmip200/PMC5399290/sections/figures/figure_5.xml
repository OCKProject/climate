  <p class="p">(
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>) The black curve is for the CanESM2 ALL ensemble mean and shading is the 5–95% range. The ALL ensemble uses RCP8.5 forcing extensions after 2005. The red curve is the simulation with the greatest loss in annual maximum snow water equivalent (SWE
   <sub class="sub">max</sub>) between 2013 and 2038. The blue curve is the simulation with the largest gain over the same 2013 to 2038 period. All values are 5-year averages plotted on the central year. (
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>) Per cent change in SWE
   <sub class="sub">max</sub> between the periods centred on 2013 and 2038 under different radiative forcing scenarios. Results in orange are from the CMIP5 multi-model ensemble (
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). CMIP5 results are based on the analysis of one ensemble member (r1i1p1) from each CMIP5 model for which there exists a historical simulation with ALL forcing and a corresponding RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and/or RCP8.5 extension. The box-and-whiskers plots show ensemble-mean SWE
   <sub class="sub">max</sub> values, the 95% uncertainty ranges on the ensemble-mean values, and the minimum-to-maximum ranges. All values in this figure are for area averages of SWE
   <sub class="sub">max</sub> at elevations greater than 1,500 m and north of 30°N and south of 50°N.
