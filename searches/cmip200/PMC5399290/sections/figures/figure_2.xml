  <title class="title">Climatology and trend in area-average annual maximum snow water equivalent.</title>
  <p class="p">The green bars show snow telemetry (SnoTel) ranges (±1 s.d.) computed from random samples of stations from the SnoTel network (see main text). The pink bars show ranges (±1 s.d.) from four land surface reanalyses (REANAL4). The black ellipse encompasses 95% of the climatology and trend values across 50 simulations of a global climate model. The circles represent the average climatology and trend for SnoTel, REANAL4 and the CanESM2 ALL simulations. All values in this figure are area averages of annual maximum snow water equivalent (SWE
   <sub class="sub">max</sub>) at elevations greater than 1,500 m and north of 30°N and south of 50°N. The period considered is the maximally overlapping period from 1982 to 2010.
