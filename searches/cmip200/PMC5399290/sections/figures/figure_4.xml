  <p class="p">(
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>) Anomaly in non-overlapping 5-year averages of annual maximum snow water equivalent (SWE
   <sub class="sub">max</sub>). Solid black is ALL ensemble-mean and grey is 10–90% range (based on 50 ALL realizations). Solid blue line is NAT ensemble mean and dashed blue lines indicate the 10 and 90% values. The ALL and NAT curves are from CanESM2. The dashed black curve is from the 35-member set of CanRCM4 simulations with ALL forcing. Pink denotes the average of four reanalyses and green is the SnoTel observations. Anomalies are defined in Methods. (
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>) Scaling factor and 5–95% uncertainty range estimated from application of an optimal fingerprint method to SnoTel observations, reanalyses and CanESM2 simulation output (see Methods). Scaling factors greater than 0 and consistent with 1 indicate that a model-predicted SWE
   <sub class="sub">max</sub> signal has been detected in observations and attributed to the imposed forcing changes in the ALL or NAT simulations.
