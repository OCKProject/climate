<p class="p">Our analysis makes innovative use of a large ensemble of simulations. This ensemble was generated with the same climate model and external forcings, but with each ensemble member commencing from slightly different initial conditions. The ensemble provides estimates of the relative contributions of internal variability and external forcing to near-term loss of regional snowpack over the western United States. Over this region, and over a relatively short (ca. 30-year) time horizon, decadal variability may offset some of the anthropogenically forced loss in snowpack. Of greater concern, however, is that decadal variability has the potential to substantially enhance the near-term decline in snowpack expected in response to anthropogenic forcing. These reductions in snowpack water storage have broad implications for future forest productivity and carbon storage
