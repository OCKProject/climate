<p class="p">Because of their high computational cost, large (&gt;10-member) ensembles are rare. It is also rare for groups to perform multiple large ensembles, one consisting of simulations with anthropogenic forcing only, and one with simulations incorporating solar and volcanic forcing alone. Here, we generate and analyse 50-member anthropogenic and naturally forced ensembles. We also rely on a large ensemble of higher-resolution regional climate model simulations driven with the output from the global climate model.</p>
