<p class="p">The observational data include REANAL4 for 1982–2010 and SnoTel for 1982–2014. The anomalies relative to 1951–1980 climatology are used as 
 <italic class="italic">y</italic>. For the REANAL4 or SnoTel series, the anomalies are obtained by removing the 1951–1980 climatology of the Global Land Data Assimilation System data set and the difference between REANAL4 or SnoTel over the common period 1982–2010, respectively, assuming time-invariant systematic biases among the data sets.
