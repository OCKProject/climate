<p class="p">The analyses are conducted on non-overlapping 5-year average time series of annual SWE
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> anomalies. We use 5-year mean time series to remove the influence of high-frequency natural variability, particularly variability related to the El Niño-Southern Oscillation. For REANAL4 and SnoTel, the first average is computed over the 4-year period 1982–1985.
