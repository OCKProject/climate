<p class="p">These simulations were performed with the CanRCM4; (this has a nominal resolution of 50â€‰km; ref. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" class="xref">25</xref>). An ensemble of 35 CanRCM4 simulations was driven (at the horizontal and lower boundaries of the regional model's domain) by daily output from the large initial-condition ensemble of global climate model simulations. Observed natural and anthropogenic forcings are identical to those employed in the global coupled climate model simulations. Downscaling was performed over the North American domain defined in the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment
