<p class="p">The simulations analysed here were performed with the CanESM2 (ref. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" class="xref">23</xref>), a climate model with interactive atmosphere, ocean, sea ice, land and carbon cycle components, run at T63 resolution. Two large initial-condition ensembles, each consisting of 50 simulations, were randomly initiated from the conditions on 1 January 1950. The random perturbation to the initial atmospheric state is introduced via a parameterization of one aspect of model cloud properties. This parameterization employs a random number generator with a pre-set seed; the 50 individual simulations in each ensemble were based on different seeds. In this way, different climate change realizations were produced without any change to the model dynamics, physics or structure. The NAT simulations used observed estimates of historical changes in solar irradiance and volcanic aerosol loadings. The ALL simulations incorporate (in addition to solar and volcanic forcing) estimated historical changes in greenhouse gases, aerosols, ozone and land use. Both ALL and NAT simulations end in December 2004. The RCP8.5 scenario was used to extend the ALL simulations from January 2005 onwards.
