<p class="p">It is well established that the North American continent is warming
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1" class="xref">1</xref>, partly due to increasing emissions of well-mixed greenhouse gases
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2" class="xref">2</xref>. In the winter season, this warming contributed to snowpack loss over the western United States

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5" class="xref">5</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6" class="xref">6</xref>. It is also well known that the region's climate is substantially influenced by decadal variability originating in the adjacent Pacific Ocean
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7" class="xref">7</xref>. In this study we employ observations, land surface reanalyses and climate model simulations to characterize the combined influences of decadal variability and external forcing on recently observed and near-term projected changes in snowpack over the western United States.
