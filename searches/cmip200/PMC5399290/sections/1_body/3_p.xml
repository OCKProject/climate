<p class="p">Although several studies have found an anthropogenic contribution to snowpack loss over the western United States, the combined influences of decadal variability and external forcing remain poorly quantified in observations and near-term projections. In this study, we show that losses in regional snowpack over the past few decades are consistent with natural and anthropogenic changes, but are inconsistent with natural changes alone. We predict an additional loss of snowpack water storage of up to 60% within the next three decades due to combined influences from anthropogenic forcing and internal decadal variability.</p>
