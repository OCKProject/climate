<p class="p">Recognition of the pronounced influence of decadal variability on regional trends in climate is motivating efforts to generate large initial condition ensembles of global climate model simulations. These ensembles provide estimates of the relative contributions of internal variability and external forcing to regional-scale climate changes

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11" class="xref">11</xref>. An initial condition ensemble consists of many individual simulations performed with a given coupled climate model; each simulation uses the same external forcing, but is initiated from slightly different conditions of the atmosphere and/or ocean state. Each ensemble member has a different realization of internal variability superimposed on the underlying externally forced response.
