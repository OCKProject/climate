<p class="p">Our focus is on quantifying the combined contribution of internal variability and external forcing to near-term projected SWE
 <sub class="sub">max</sub>. The largest near-term loss in accumulated snowpack over the western United States is ∼60%; this was calculated as the per cent change between averages over the 5-year periods centred on 2013 and 2038. The largest near-term gain is about 3%. The substantial difference between these two percentage changes—obtained with the same physical climate model, driven by the same external forcings—underscores the potentially large contribution of decadal variability to regional-scale changes in SWE
 <sub class="sub">max</sub>, particularly on shorter (ca. 30-year) timescales. The range in projected snowpack reductions reflects the interplay between temperature and precipitation trends on the end of season SWE

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27" class="xref">27</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28" class="xref">28</xref>. Averaging over realizations reduces this variability, and provides a better estimate of the underlying response to external forcing, yielding about a 30% loss of regional snowpack in the ALL ensemble mean.
