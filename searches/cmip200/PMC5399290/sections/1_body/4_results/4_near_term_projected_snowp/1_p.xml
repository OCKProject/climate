 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5" class="xref">Figure 5a</xref> shows 5-year mean SWE
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> from the ALL ensemble, averaged at elevations greater than 1,500 m. The first 5-year period is centred on 1988 and the last 5-year period is centred on 2038. The ALL ensemble uses the RCP8.5 forcing extension after 2005. The ensemble-mean response (black curve) shows a small increase in the rate of SWE
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> decline from the first half of the analysis period shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5" class="xref">Fig. 5a</xref> to the second half of the analysis period. More specifically, the externally forced trend in SWE
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> is about −0.50 cm per decade from 1988 to 2013 and about −0.62 cm per decade from 2013 to 2038. This increase in the rate of SWE
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> decline is significant at 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>&lt;0.05, where significance is assessed using a standard difference of means test on the 50 simulated trends in the earlier period and the 50 simulated trends in the later period. As noted in ref. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" class="xref">15</xref>, distinguishing rates of change in externally forced response over small regions and short timescales, such as these, requires large ensembles of simulations (as shown here).
