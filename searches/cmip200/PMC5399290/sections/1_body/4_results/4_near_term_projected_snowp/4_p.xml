<p class="p">We also compare the projections of regional SWE
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> changes in CMIP5 models and CanESM2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4b</xref>). Results are for changes in ensemble-mean simulated SWE
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> between the 5-year periods centred on 2013 and 2038; the minimum-to-maximum ranges are also indicated. The CMIP5 set consists of one ensemble member (r1i1p1) from each CMIP5 model with an ALL forcing historical simulation and corresponding RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 extension (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). The range associated with the CanESM2 initial condition ensemble (for ALL forcing and the RCP8.5 extension) solely reflects the influence of decadal variability. The ranges associated with the CMIP5 multi-model ensemble are indicative of both decadal variability and model uncertainty.
