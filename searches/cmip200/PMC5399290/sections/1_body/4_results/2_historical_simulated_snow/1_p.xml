<p class="p">Our ensemble of model simulations was generated with the Canadian Earth System Model version 2 (CanESM2; see Methods and ref. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" class="xref">23</xref>). Simulations include historical forcings from 1950 to 2005 and RCP8.5 forcing extensions after 2005. The RCP8.5 pathway is a high-emission scenario leading to an 8.5 W m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> increase in radiative forcing by 2,100. Over the early part of the twenty-first century, forcing differences between RCP8.5 and other commonly analysed RCPs are relatively small
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" class="xref">24</xref>. Two 50-member ensembles were run with CanESM2, one with natural and anthropogenic forcings (ALL) and one with only natural forcings (NAT). Anthropogenic forcings include changes in well-mixed greenhouse gases, anthropogenic aerosols, tropospheric and stratospheric ozone, and land use. Natural forcings consist of changes in solar irradiance and volcanic aerosol loadings.
