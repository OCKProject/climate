<p class="p">Because there is only one realization of internal variability in the real world, we do not expect the CanESM2 ensemble-mean SWE
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> (which is averaged over many different model realizations of internal variability) to closely follow the time evolution of SWE
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> in the SnoTel data and REANAL4. The key point here is that the multi-decadal changes in SWE
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> are reasonably similar in SnoTel, REANAL4, and the CanESM2 and CanRCM4 ensembles under ALL forcing. Under NAT forcing, however, the CanESM2 ensemble mean does not replicate the observed decline in SWE
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> since the 1980s.
