 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Figure 4a</xref> shows 5-year mean anomalies of area-averaged SWE
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> at elevations greater than 1,500 m. Results are from SnoTel (green), REANAL4 (pink) and the ALL simulations (black). We also show results obtained by dynamical downscaling of 35 members of the CanESM2 ALL ensemble and RCP8.5 continuation (dashed curve). Downscaling relied on the Canadian Regional Climate Model version 4 (CanRCM4), which has a nominal resolution of 50 km (see Methods and ref. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" class="xref">25</xref>). Downscaling was performed over the North American domain defined in the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26" class="xref">26</xref>. The similarity between the CanESM2 and CanRCM4 ensemble-mean time series (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>=0.99) is evidence that the temporal variability of area-average SWE
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> from CanESM2 is relatively insensitive to an increase in spatial resolution.
