<p class="p">For the ALL ensemble, area-averaging the simulated SWE
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> at elevations greater than 1,500 m (north of 30°N and south of 50°N) yields an ensemble-mean climatology and trend of 6.1 cm and −0.57 cm per decade. The trend has a 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> value less than 0.001. The simulated trend is in good agreement with the average of the four reanalyses; the simulated climatology is at the high end of the reanalysis estimates (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>). The latter suggests greater climatological snowfall in the model than in reality, although this is difficult to assess given the absence of a reliable long-term observational record of winter precipitation. The simulated pattern of climatological SWE
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> is in reasonable agreement with the comparable field in reanalyses (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>), albeit with spatial detail given the coarser resolution of the global coupled model (which is nominally 2.8° longitude by 2.8° latitude).
