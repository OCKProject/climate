 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Figure 2</xref> shows that the climatology and trend are 4.6 cm and −0.33 cm per decade, respectively. The trend has a

 <sub class="sub">max</sub> represents about a 9.5% loss; this is expressed as the per cent difference between the decadal averages of SWE
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> in 1982–1992 and 2000–2010 (the first and last decades of the period of maximum overlap). This multi-decade decline in regional snowpack is consistent with results from refs

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" class="xref">15</xref>, despite the fact that these studies used different time periods, data sets and metrics. (The sensitivity to the metric used, for example, 1 April SWE or SWE
