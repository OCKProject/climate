<p class="p">Area averaging SWE
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> at elevations greater than 1,500 m (north of 30°N and south of 50°N) yields a reanalysis-mean climatology and trend of 3.9 cm and −0.56 cm per decade, respectively. The trend has a 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> value less than 0.01. This decrease in SWE
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> represents an ∼21.8% loss between 1982–1992 and 2000–2010. The correlation between the SWE
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> time series from REANAL4 and SnoTel is 0.73. The range of climatology and trend estimates from the four reanalysis products encompasses the corresponding SnoTel estimates (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" class="xref">22</xref>. The green bars in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref> show the uncertainties associated with the SnoTel values. Here, uncertainties are computed as ±1 s.d. across 10,000 random samples of the SnoTel stations. In each case, a station is randomly selected and the average climatology and trend is computed across a random selection of no more than 10 of its neighbouring stations within 1° longitude and 1° latitude (the spatial resolution of the reanalyses). In short, the SnoTel and REANAL4 results are consistent within the uncertainties in each data source; this holds for both climatologies and trends.
