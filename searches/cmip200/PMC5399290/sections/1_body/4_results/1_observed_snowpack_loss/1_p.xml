<p class="p">Observations of snow water equivalent (SWE) were acquired from the United States Natural Resource Conservation Service Snow Telemetry (SnoTel) network of automated snow pillow measurements across alpine sites. These measurements were taken from a quality-controlled data set discussed in ref. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" class="xref">12</xref>. We restrict our analysis to the post-1981 period since the number of observations before this time is too low to allow calculation of reliable regional averages. Monthly-mean (January-May) SnoTel observations are continuously available from 1982 to 2016 at 354 stations with elevations greater than 1,500 m. A threshold of 1,500 m provides good regional coverage; use of continuous observations avoids introducing temporal changes in spatial coverage. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Figure 1</xref> shows that 307 of the 354 stations (or about 87% of all stations) show a negative trend in annual maximum SWE (SWE
 <sub class="sub">max</sub>). The maximum loss typically occurs in April. Here and subsequently, SWE
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> is computed over 1982–2010 to facilitate comparison with reanalysis-based estimates for the maximum period of overlap between the reanalyses and the SnoTel data (see below).
