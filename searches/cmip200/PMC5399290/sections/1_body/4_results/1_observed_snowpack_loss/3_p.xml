<p class="p">We also consider a group of four gridded SWE data sets obtained from reanalysis products (hereafter referred to as REANAL4). These four data sets have been assessed in ref. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17" class="xref">17</xref> over the common period of availability from 1982 to 2010. Whereas the SnoTel measurements provide a purely observational perspective, the REANAL4 group has been produced using snow schemes of varying complexity embedded in land surface models forced by meteorological reanalyses. The following data sets were used: (1) the Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (ref. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" class="xref">18</xref>); (2) the European Centre for Medium-Range Forecasts Interim Land Reanalysis
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19" class="xref">19</xref>; (3) the Modern Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20" class="xref">20</xref>; and (4) the Crocus snow scheme driven by ERA-Interim meteorology
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" class="xref">21</xref>. Differences between these data sets have been discussed at length in ref. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17" class="xref">17</xref>. The SWE fields were re-gridded to a 1° longitude by 1° latitude grid; monthly mean SWE results were averaged across the four reanalyses.
