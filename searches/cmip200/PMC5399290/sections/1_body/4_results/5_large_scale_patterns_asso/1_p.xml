 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6" class="xref">Figure 6</xref> shows the sea level pressure and surface air temperature patterns associated with a large negative contribution to regional snowpack from decadal variability in the period from 2030 to 2040 as obtained from the CanESM2 ensemble. These patterns are indicative of a stronger than normal Aleutian Low. The Aleutian Low is a semi-permanent low pressure centre located near the Aleutian Islands during the winter. It is one of the main centres of action in the atmospheric circulation of the Northern Hemisphere. The circulation anomalies associated with the stronger than normal Aleutian Low are responsible for transporting anomalously warm and moist air over the western United States. The impact of warm air on regional snowpack is obvious (especially where temperatures are above or about the freezing point). The impact of increased precipitation on snowpack is generally more complex
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29" class="xref">29</xref>, but our model shows that the anomalous precipitation falls as rain rather than snow, therefore yielding a reduction in snowpack.
