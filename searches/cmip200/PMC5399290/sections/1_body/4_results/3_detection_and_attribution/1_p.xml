<p class="p">We use a standard optimal fingerprinting method to address the causes of these SWE
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> changes. This involves regressing the observations onto the simulated ALL and NAT responses. The resulting values of the scaling factor 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic> provide information on the extent to which the model SWE
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> responses must be scaled to best reproduce the observed SWE
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> changes. The method also yields the 90% confidence intervals on 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic> estimates (see Methods).
