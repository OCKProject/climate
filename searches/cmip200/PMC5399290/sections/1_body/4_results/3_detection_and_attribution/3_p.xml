<p class="p">Since we do not have a CanESM2 ensemble with anthropogenic forcing only, we compute the anthropogenic scaling factor by linear regression of the reanalyses or observations onto the difference between the ALL and NAT responses (denoted by ANT). We assume additivity of the ANT and NAT SWE
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> responses. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Figure 4b</xref> shows that the estimated ANT SWE
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> changes: (1) are consistent with the reanalyses; (2) are detectable in the SnoTel observations but with significantly smaller magnitude; and (3) yield very similar 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic> values to the ALL case. Regarding (2), when average SWE
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> is computed over the larger region encompassing elevations greater than 1 km (in order to reduce the noise contribution inherent in point measurements) anthropogenic forcing more successfully reproduces the magnitude of the SnoTel changes (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). While the results from this analysis provide clear evidence of an anthropogenic influence on snowpack water storage, it is difficult to more reliably quantify the magnitude of this influence given the relatively short observational SWE
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> record, the effects of underlying variability and the uncertainties inherent in our indirect estimate of the ANT SWE
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> response.
