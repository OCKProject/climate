 </sup>. While each individual crop type can have higher or lower water requirements, this is generally accepted as a reference value. In practice, this reference value is multiplied by a crop coefficient that increases or decreases the crop water requirements based on the specific crop type and growth stage. However, in West Africa, most grown cereal crops have a total crop coefficient between ~0.8 and ~1, very close to that of the reference crop Alfalfa during their growing season. Therefore CWD for the reference crop can provides a general understanding on how cropÂ water demand is projected to change in future climate over West Africa.
