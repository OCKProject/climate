<p id="Par13" class="p">IWN is water amount required in addition to effective rainfall mandatory to optimally sustain a crop. It is considered as the deficit, if any, between CWD and the effective rainfall for optimal crop growth assuming good soil conditions. Effective rainfall is considered as the portion of total rainfall available for plant growth. In this study, it is assumed that the actual evapotranspiration rate 
 <italic class="italic">ET</italic> is the water used in the crop growth process and hence equivalent to the effective rainfall

 </sup>. Therefore, IWN is simplified as the difference between 
 <italic class="italic">ET</italic>
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> and 
 <italic class="italic">ET</italic>. If effective rainfall (
 <italic class="italic">ET</italic>) exceeds CWD (
 <italic class="italic">ET</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">o</italic>
 </sub>), IWN is 0 and in the case of no effective rainfall, IWN is 
 <italic class="italic">ET</italic>
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> (see SI for more details).
