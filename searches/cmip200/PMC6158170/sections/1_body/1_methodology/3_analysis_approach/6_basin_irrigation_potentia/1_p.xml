<p id="Par15" class="p">BIP provides a measure of water availability in excess or deficit of IWN that has the potential to be stored and used for irrigation. It is calculated as the difference between WA and IWN. If WA is greater than IWN, it is assumed that the basin can potentially meet its irrigation needs through the development of its water resources and vice versa. Therefore, a larger BIP in a future climate is indicative of a basin that has the potential to store more water (see SI for more details).</p>
