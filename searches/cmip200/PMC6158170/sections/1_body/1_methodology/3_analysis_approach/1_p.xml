<p id="Par9" class="p">The overall goal of this study is to the assess large-scale irrigation potential at a basin level in West Africa for the historical period and for the expected future climate when the global warming is limited to 2 °C and 1.5 °C. Since irrigation at the large-scale requires the development of water storage reservoirs, crop cycles would no longer need to be fully tied to the rainy season. As a result, annual mean changes are considered assuming that water can be stored and used during the dry seasons when temperatures may be more favorable depending on the location or for a second cropping cycle.</p>
