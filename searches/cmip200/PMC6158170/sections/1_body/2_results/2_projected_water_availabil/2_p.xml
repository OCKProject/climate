<p id="Par23" class="p">To examine whether the water availability is in excess or deficit compared to the IWN over each basin, BIP is considered, which provides an indication of whether or not a basin can store more water to meet demands. Despite the increases in WA in some areas, decreases in BIP is projected for all basins and both models of

 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). In the Sahelian basins, such as Senegal, Gambia, Niger, Chad and to some extent Volta, the decreases are limited to around 10% to 30%. However, in the smaller basins located in the Gulf of Guinea (i.e. Sassandra, Bandama, Comoe, Mono and Oueme), the decrease is considerably larger ranging between 35% to 65% with the highest decreases in Bandama and Oueme. This is largely a consequence of greater changes in IWN outweighing the increases in WA in many areas of these basins. Similar results are found for the 1.5 °C scenarios but with lower values (within 15% for the Sahel basins and between 25% to 60% in the Gulf of Guinea basins). The magnitude of the changes with the Hamon formulation is greater than that of Hargreaves due to the larger IWN changes (i.e. Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). An uncertainty analysis of the ensemble members reveals that in most of the basins, the inter-quantile ranges, median and most of the distribution of the projected BIP changes are negative. This indicates that although the individual ensemble members differ compared to the ensemble average, most of the experiments project decreases in BIP suggesting that the results are robust. Furthermore, the intermodel spread is larger in the basins along the Gulf of Guinea compared to that in the Sahel hinting more consistent changes in basins such Senegal, Gambia, Niger, Chad and to some extent Volta.
