<p id="Par6" class="p">In this study, we aim to reduce the uncertainties resulting from the aforementioned issues by taking advantage of a 23-member high resolution ensemble of RCM simulations performed as part of the most recent high resolution COordinated Regional climate Downscaling EXperiment (CORDEX). Future warming scenarios considered here are based on the 2015 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> Conference of Parties (COP 21) Paris Agreement, where all nations pledged to hold global temperature increase to below 2 °C (relative to pre-industrial levels) and to explore further efforts to limit the increase to 1.5 °C. How the hydroclimatology of the West African major river basins will respond under such a change has yet to be investigated. This study thus evaluates and intercompares climate change impacts on the hydroclimatology of the major West African river basins under 1.5 °C and 2 °C global warming scenarios. To overcome data scarcity related to the calibration and verification of hydrological models, output from the 23-member CORDEX RCM ensemble is used to characterize key variables relevant for the hydrology and water resources over the major West African river basins

 </sup>. Specifically, changes in water availability and crop water demand and irrigation water need are examined and intercompared to assess the irrigation potential at basin level.
