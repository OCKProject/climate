 </sup>. However, these studies tend to be uncoordinated in the sense that they consider different emissions pathways and different future and historical time periods. In addition, they tend to focus on changes of temperature and precipitation, and not to further variables that are additionally relevant to water resources. Lastly, hypotheses of future GHG emissions pathways engender an additional level of uncertainty in the projections which is also problematic of most of the GCM studies
