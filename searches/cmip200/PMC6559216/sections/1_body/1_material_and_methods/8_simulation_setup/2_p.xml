 <italic class="italic">Lincoln,</italic> with a total available water capacity of 270 mm, was used for all sites in NZ, to eliminate site-specific soil effects from the analysis. The soil profile was filled with the maximum available water capacity at sowing in both countries, the UK and NZ. Typical sowing dates of 20-October in the UK and 20-April in NZ were used. The performance of the current local winter wheat
