 <xref rid="bib0430" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Stratonovitch and Semenov, 2010</xref>). The EASA is a universal search optimization method, in which control parameters, inherited from a parent, determine variation in the target parameters, mutate randomly and independently, and evolve along with the target parameters to accelerate convergence (
 <xref rid="bib0380" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Semenov and Terkel, 2003</xref>). In each step of optimization, 16 new candidate ideotypes were generated from a ‘parent’ by perturbing its cultivar parameters randomly within the parameters’ ranges as defined in 
 <xref rid="tbl0015" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>. As mentioned in “
 <italic class="italic">Designing wheat ideotypes</italic>”, the local winter wheat

 <italic class="italic">Claire</italic> was used as a parent in our study, and the parameter ranges were based on model calibrations for existing modern wheat cultivars, allowing variations corresponding to the existing wheat germplasm (

 <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Akkaya et al., 2006</xref>;

 <xref rid="bib0410" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Shearman et al., 2005</xref>). Then for each candidate, yields were simulated for 100 years of future climate scenario. The candidate with the highest mean yield was selected as a parent for the next step. Candidates with a coefficient of variation (
 <italic class="italic">CV</italic>) of yield exceeding 10% or a harvest index (HI) over 0.64 were removed from the selection process. A 
 <italic class="italic">CV</italic> of less than 10% guarantees high yield stability, which is a desirable trait in future cultivars, while the upper limit of HI was reported as 0.64 (Foulkes et al., 2011). The optimization process continued until no further improvement in yield potential was possible, or parameters converged to optimal values. To avoid convergence to a local maximum and to explore fully the parameter spaces, we initialized EASA with multiple ‘parents’. For each site, we used eight parents randomly scattered in the parameter space, except one parent that has the same cultivar parameters as 
 <italic class="italic">Claire</italic>. For each of the eight initial parents, EASA converges to an optimal combination of parameters; the best of the eight was selected as an optimal ideotype for a selected site.
