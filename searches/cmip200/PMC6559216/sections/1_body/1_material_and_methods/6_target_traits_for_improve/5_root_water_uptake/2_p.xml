<p id="par0090" class="p">In Sirius, we assume that only a proportion of available soil water can be extracted from each layer in the root zone by the plant on any day, depending on efficiency of water extraction (Î») and rate of root water uptake (

  <sub class="sub">u</sub>
 </italic>). The proportion of daily water extractable by the plant declines from 10% at the top of the soil to 
 <italic class="italic">R
  <sub class="sub">u</sub>
 </italic> at maximum root length. Faster root water uptake could reduce the current water stress experienced by plant in anticipation of additional available water later in the season in the form of precipitation or irrigation. In contrast, an alternative strategy of slower root water uptake might increase yield in dry environments by conserving water for successful completion of the life cycle (Manschadi et al., 2006).
