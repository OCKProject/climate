This represents 2.7 °C, 40% and 48% greater mean annual air temperature, mean annual precipitation and daily mean global radiation, respectively in NZ compared to the UK. There were increasing trends in temperature and global radiation between sites from high (northern) to low (southern) latitudes in the UK (ED–RR). Similar trends were also found among sites in NZ from high (southern) to low (northern) latitudes (GO–PU). In the UK, annual precipitation was almost equally high at ED and RR, and lowest at LE, whereas annual precipitation for NZ was highest at PU and lowest at LI. In the 2050-climate, averaged air temperature and global radiation increased compared to the baseline-climate by 2.1 °C and 6.7% respectively in the UK, and 1.9 °C and 1.1% respectively in NZ, whereas the decrease in annual precipitation was small (&lt;2%) in both the UK and NZ (
