<p id="par0175" class="p">A 13% additional yield potential was obtained for winter wheat under 2050-climate in potential condition compared to water-limited condition in NZ, whereas almost no such yield benefit was achieved in the UK. These results indicate that wheat ideotype designed for the rainfed condition in the UK has the best possible yield potential under the future climatic condition, and it is not possible to push the yield potential up further by designing a separate ideotype for the non-water-limited condition due to the local climatic limitations. On the other hand, it is possible to achieve greater yield potential of wheat in NZ by designing wheat ideotypes separately for water-limited and optimal conditions due to the local climatic advantages. A higher yield potential of wheat under optimal than water-limited condition particularly in NZ could be explained by relatively better optimized cultivar parameters and crop-physiology (
