 <italic class="italic">Claire</italic> is due to the improvements in both the sources (e.g., photosynthate and biomass) and sink sizes (e.g., grain number) resulting from optimised cultivar parameters and plant traits under 2050-climate. The optimized canopy structure under 2050-climate, in terms of

 <italic class="italic">S
  <sub class="sub">G</sub>

  <sub class="sub">G</sub>

 <xref rid="bib0370" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Semenov and Stratonovitch, 2013</xref>). Improved grain filling duration is another important trait for raising yield potentials of both ideotypes. Extending grain filling period not only increases intercepted radiation and photosynthesis after anthesis for direct grain filling, but also increase the chance of complete translocation of plant-reserved labile carbohydrate into grain, and thus improved HI and grain yield (

 <italic class="italic">P
  <sub class="sub">p</sub>

 <xref rid="bib0190" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Jamieson et al., 1998a</xref>). The rate of crop development, and anthesis and maturity time could be manipulated by modifying

 <xref rid="bib0400" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Semenov et al., 2014</xref>). Increased 
 <italic class="italic">P
  <sub class="sub">h</sub>

 <italic class="italic">IW
  <sub class="sub">2050</sub>
 </italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">IP
  <sub class="sub">2050</sub>
 </italic>, is beneficial for keeping the rate of crop development lower under higher temperatures in the 2050-climate. A slower phenological development supports a longer crop duration, resulting in greater intercepted radiation and crop yield. An optimal anthesis date is one of the key traits for high yield potential, as favourable environmental conditions at anthesis promotes greater primary grain seating (
 <xref rid="bib0170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hills and Li, 2016</xref>). Timing of athesis (early/late) influences also biomass production and labile carbohydrate reserve at anthesis. Our results show that a late anthesis is beneficial for high yield potential of both ideotypes under 2050-climate in NZ, but an early anthesis is important in the UK. Additional model runs with the late anthesis under 2050-climate in the UK revealed that a higher temperature during grain filling was the main reason for compromise between early anthesis and extended grain filling duration for a better yield potential in the UK, whereas no such limitation was found in NZ. Present results predict that longer wheat growing season compared to 
 <italic class="italic">Claire</italic> is important under 2050-climate for high yield potential of both ideotypes particularly in NZ. The delayed anthesis and maturity help to increase total intercepted solar radiation, photosynthesis, biomass production and grain yield NZ (

 <xref rid="bib0370" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Semenov and Stratonovitch, 2013</xref>). However, a shorter wheat-growing season than the current 
 <italic class="italic">cv. Claire</italic> is beneficial to optimize anthesis, grain filling duration, intercepted radiation and ultimately the grain yield under 2050-climate in the UK. Relatively longer day length during wheat growing period in the UK than NZ due to the higher latitude is another constraint in increasing leaf number, and hence delaying anthesis and extending maturity in the UK. In Sirius, final leaf number before anthesis decreases with increasing day length, resulting in a shorter vegetative stage and early flowering and maturity (

 <xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Jamieson et al., 1998b</xref>). Increased optimized trait ‘rate of root water uptake’

  <sub class="sub">u</sub>
 </italic> in both the ideotypes in NZ and 
 <italic class="italic">IP
  <sub class="sub">2050</sub>
 </italic> in the UK compared to 
 <italic class="italic">Claire</italic> shows that improvement in rate of root water uptake is helpful to increase biomass and grain yield potentials and to satisfy any water stress particularly under potential condition in both countries. On the contrary, a reduced rate of root water uptake would be an important strategy for successful completion of the crop life-cycle along with best possible yield under 2050-climate in water-limited condition particularly in the UK (

 <xref rid="bib0405" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Senapati et al., 2018</xref>). However, no such limitation was found under water-limited condition in NZ. Other reasons for the greater yield potentials of both ideotypes in the 2050-climate compared to present yield of 
 <italic class="italic">Claire</italic> are the CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fertilization effect and 
 <italic class="italic">LUE</italic> improvement, as mentioned in the section ‘Simulation setup’. It is worth mentioning that HI was not optimized directly in our study. The mean HI of both ideotypes ranged between 0.45 and 0.52, whereas the upper theoretical limit of HI reported as 0.64 (
 <xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Foulkes et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, our results indicate that there is still an additional possibility to raise genetic yield potential of wheat further by optimising partitioning of assimilate to grain while maintaining lodging resistance.
