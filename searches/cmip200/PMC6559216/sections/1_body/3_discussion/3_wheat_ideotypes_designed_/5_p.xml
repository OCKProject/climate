 <xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Jamieson et al., 1998b</xref>). However, the main reason of greater genetic yield potentials of both ideotypes in NZ compared to the UK could be explained by higher cumulative intercepted radiation over the wheat-growing period (
 <xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>) due to greater mean annual solar radiation (40–48%) across our study sites in NZ (southern hemisphere, 37–46 °S) than the UK (northern hemisphere, 52–56 °N). Greater mean annual solar radiation in NZ compared to the UK could be explained by lower latitude (≤10°), thinner O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> layer and lower pollution in NZ, and the asymmetric elliptical shape of the earth’s orbit, which brings the southern hemisphere closer to the sun during the southern summer than the northern hemisphere during the northern summer (
 <xref rid="bib0275" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">NASA, 2009</xref>). A positive relationship has been reported between solar radiation and wheat yield, whereas a negative relationship has been found between wheat yield and air pollution (

 <xref rid="bib0300" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Reynolds et al., 2009</xref>). Greater plant biomass in NZ (Supplementary Fig. S1) increased the availability of assimilates for ear formation, resulting in greater spikelet and grain numbers and ultimately higher wheat yields than in the UK (

 <xref rid="bib0300" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Reynolds et al., 2009</xref>). Another reason for greater biomass and grain yield in NZ than in the UK could be a higher photothermal quotient (solar radiation/air temperature) in NZ (Supplementary Fig. S2). Although averaged annual air temperature was 2.4–2.7 °C greater in NZ than in the UK, the photothermal quotient was 18% greater in NZ than in the UK. Total crop biomass, as well as grain yield, was found to increase with an increasing photothermal quotient (

 <xref rid="bib0475" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wolf et al., 1996</xref>). Thus, local climatic advantages, such as greater solar radiation and photothermal quotient, and shorter day length, are the main drivers of greater wheat yield potential in NZ, whereas lower solar radiation and photothermal quotient and longer day length are the constraints in raising yield potential in the UK to the same extent as in NZ. Different local climatic advantages and limitations on wheat yield had been found at various locations around the world, for examples, solar radiation, photothermal quotient, day length, high temperature etc. (
