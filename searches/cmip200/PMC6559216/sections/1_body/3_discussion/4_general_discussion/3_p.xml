 <italic class="italic">RCP8.5</italic>) under water limited condition in the UK and NZ, whereas under potential condition, up to 51–62% increase could be achieved. NZ would have higher yield potential (16–31%) under both the water-limited and potential conditions due to the local climatic advantages compared to the UK, but wheat ideotypes need to be designed separately for NZ to make greatest use of the local climatic conditions. Although recorded wheat yields in the UK and NZ are one of the highest, our study demonstrates the possibility of substantially increasing the genetic wheat yield potential under future climatic conditions. The design of wheat ideotypes in the present study provides plant scientists and wheat breeders with a possible road map for selection of the target traits and their optimal combinations quantitatively for wheat improvement and genetic adaptation to increase the yield potential of wheat under climate change. The method of designing wheat ideotypes to raise yield potential under future climatic conditions in our study is generic in nature, and therefore it could be applicable globally. However, the extent of possible yield improvement would depend on local climatic and environmental conditions.
