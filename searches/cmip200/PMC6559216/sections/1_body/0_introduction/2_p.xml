 <xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">FAO, 2014</xref>). At the same time, the combination of ongoing climate change, including increasing air temperature, changing precipitation patterns and quantities, the increasing frequency and severity of extreme climatic events and adverse weather conditions, threatens present food production and any future targets (

 <xref rid="bib0485" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Zampieri et al., 2017</xref>). With the limited scope for extending present crop-growing areas, a considerable increase in crop productivity is required to guarantee future food security in the face of ongoing climate change (
 <xref rid="bib0305" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Reynolds et al., 2011</xref>). Increasing the upper limit of genetic yield potential is one of the key components of an integrated approach to improve crop productivity, besides optimization of agronomic management and sustainable intensification (
