 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5" class="xref">Figure 5</xref> provides an alternate illustration of the overall uncertainty (i.e., larger coefficients of variation) among the model-RCP combinations. It shows both a negative correlation between coefficient of variation and mean population size and an increase in variation as the timeframe increases. This suggests that the largest per-cell uncertainty among model-RCP temperature estimates are in regions that would typically produce smaller populations (too warm or too cool) and that these estimates continue to diverge as the timeframe increases.
