 <xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Langille et al. (2016)</xref> we presented potential modeled populations for some of the more economically important berry producing counties and townships in the United States and Canada. Observed mean daily temperatures for a 20-year span (1993â€“2013) were obtained via the National Climatic Data Center (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-6" class="xref">Figure 6</xref> illustrates how the GCM model and RCP scenarios may affect population simulations in comparison with these historic temperatures. More than half of the locations (including: Bladen, North Carolina; Burlington, New Jersey; Wayne, Mississippi; Hillsborough, Florida; Santa Barbara, California; and Clark, Washington) have historic populations higher than all projected averages. This suggests that these areas are currently in or near the time frame for maximum population growth potential and that as temperatures increase over time populations should decrease. For the remaining locations (including Allegan, Michigan; Norfolk, Ontario; Chicoutimi, Quebec; and Fraser Valley, British Columbia) the historic population is consistently lower than all of the projected averages suggesting that growth potential has yet to be maximized in those locations. It is also worth noting that most of the populations are projected to decrease by the end of the present century, including Allegan and Norfolk. The exception to this decline are the two northern most regions (Fraser Valley and Chicoutimi) which may continue to increase though their population levels remain relatively small.
