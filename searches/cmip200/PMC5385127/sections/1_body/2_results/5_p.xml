<p class="p">In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4" class="xref">Fig. 4B</xref> we illustrate these differences by showing the coefficient of variation between the normalized population values. For the 2020 model-RCP combinations we see relatively low values across the map. The exceptions are larger values to the extreme south in Florida, California and Texas. The 2050s show a larger range and an increase in high-variation locations, particularly in the extreme south and north. These trends continue into the 2080s, where we note larger variations over larger areas to the north south and west. Despite these large areas of variation, there remain areas of moderate and even low variation particularly in the interior.
