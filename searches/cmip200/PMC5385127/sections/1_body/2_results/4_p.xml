<p class="p">As with the climate model, it is difficult to predict which RCP scenario will produce the most likely greenhouse gas emissions, so we further aggregate the model results by folding the model-RCP combinations into per-time frame consensus maps. Similar to 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3" class="xref">Figs.Â  3</xref>, in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4" class="xref">4A</xref> we see a general reduction in population sizes with the exception of moderate increases in the far northern regions as we move into later time frames. While these mean populations give an overall impression of possible trends it is important to acknowledge the difference in values produced by the various model-RCP combinations.
