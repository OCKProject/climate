 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref> we illustrate the base model properties under a subset of temperature scenarios from the CCSM4 model for Burlington, New Jersey. The temperatures for three different RCPs and time frame combinations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2" class="xref">Fig. 2A</xref>) show a relatively low (RCP2.6-2020), mid (RCP6.0-2050) and high (RCP8.5-2080) range of potential conditions. The difference in the temperature profiles result in varying fruit readiness date (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2" class="xref">Fig. 2B</xref>) and population levels (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2" class="xref">Fig. 2C</xref>). In particular, RCP8.5-2080 produces the earliest optimal fruit in part due to warmer temperatures early in the year while fruit ripens more quickly in RCP2.6-2020 than in RCP6.0-2050, due to slightly elevated temperatures in the March through May range. It is worth noting that the RCP6.0-2050 temperatures are generally higher than those of RCP2.6-2020 in the later part of the year (June and onward) but this occurs after fruit has matured and been harvested. Despite some variation between the curves, there are only 14 days difference between the earliest and latest readiness dates.
