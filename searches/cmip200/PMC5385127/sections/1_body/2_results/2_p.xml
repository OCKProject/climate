<p class="p">In terms of population (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2" class="xref">Fig. 2C</xref>), RCP8.5-2080 initially grows at the steepest rate but peaks relatively early in the year and begins to decline due to temperatures (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2" class="xref">Fig. 2A</xref>) that are both too high to maximize development and contribute to mortality. RCP6.0-2050 growth is slowest due to the lower early-year temperatures which also causes slower fruit quality increases (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2" class="xref">Fig. 2B</xref>). In comparison, RCP2.6-2020 provides maximum growth potential with early warmth and lower mid-to-late year temperatures that continue to foster growth without severely impacting mortality. Considering both reproductive output and development, modelled population growth occurs optimally at temperatures around 24 °C. Quantitatively, temperature profiles for RCP2.6-2020, RCP6.0-2050 and RCP8.5-2080 produce 74, 62 and 47 days respectively where temperatures are ±2 °C from model optimal.
