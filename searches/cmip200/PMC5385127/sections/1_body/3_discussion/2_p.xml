<p class="p">It is important to address the simplifications of the model used in this work. At this time there is no consideration for overwintering and as such the model is limited to single year simulations. Although empirical work continues to highlight the biological mechanisms and consequences of overwintering (

 <xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Langille et al., 2016</xref>). As a result, these simulations do not account for inter-annual population differences due to winter survival rates and subsequently presume that all regions begin with the same starting population size each year, which does not specifically reflect migrations (immigration or emigration) due to environmental or anthropogenic factors. Also, considerations for other mortality and development influencing factors such as humidity are not included but are likely to impact population growth (
