<p class="p">Given the inherent uncertainties in both the base population dynamics model and the GCM-derived temperature data, the work presented here is not intended to be quantitative predictions. Rather we hope that these results, when considered with comparable modelling efforts on 
 <italic class="italic">D. suzukii</italic> or similar pest species, will help to guide and refine empirical and theoretical work on the mechanisms that drive population levels and highlight the range of possible outcomes as we enter a critical time of rapid climatic change. As models continue to highlight our level of understanding of population-driving processes, empirical studies will continue to provide new and increasingly accurate quantitative inputs. Similarly, as GCMs continue to develop and our understanding of complex global environmental processes matures, opportunities for explorative and potentially predictive modelling of invasive species will also improve.
