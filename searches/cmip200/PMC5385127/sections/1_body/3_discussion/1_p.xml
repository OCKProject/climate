<p class="p">Understanding how pests such as 
 <italic class="italic">D. suzukii</italic> may shift in range and density over time is an important part of an effective mitigation and management strategy (

 <xref rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Dreves, 2011</xref>). By combining various climate models and emissions scenarios we provide a mean outlook as to how increasing temperatures may affect infestation potential over the coming decades. The results of our simulations offer a somewhat mixed forecast for 
 <italic class="italic">D. suzukii</italic> infestations. They suggest that some regions in North America may already be at or near the peak of their population growth potential. Distributions and infestation hot-spots may shift over the next two or three decades but as we move closer to the end of the century, depending on the degree of climatic change, we may see a marked decline in population growth potential from this destructive pest as temperatures become too warm to sustain development and mortality increases. Beyond sustained higher temperatures, an increase in short-term heat events in susceptible regions may adversely affect crop output (

 <italic class="italic">D. suzukii</italic> population growth and although many of these regions are not currently known for commercial soft-skinned fruit production currently this too may change over time (
