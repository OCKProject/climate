<p class="p">Perhaps the most important limitation of the current work is the lack of accounting for evolutionary adaptation that may well occur over the course of the century. While this simplification may be reasonable when considering both the 2020s and historic temperatures, it may be more reasonable to assume that some adaptive changes are likely to occur before the 2050s and 2080s. Both

 <xref rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gilchrist et al. (2004)</xref> have demonstrated that rapid climate-driven physiological and adaptive change is possible in other species (

 <italic class="italic">D. subobscura</italic> respectively) although 
 <xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kimura (2004)</xref> found no difference in thermal tolerance between cool and warm latitudinal strains of 
 <italic class="italic">D. suzukii</italic> in its native region of Japan. Previous work has also shown that Drosophila species (such as 
 <italic class="italic">D. melanogaster</italic>) can be cold and heat-hardened if short term temperature changes are non-lethal and that over longer term exposures acclimation can occur (

 <xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hoffmann, Sørensen &amp; Loeschcke, 2003</xref>). Heat hardening may also increase desiccation resistance (
 <xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hoffmann, 1990</xref>). What remains unclear at this time are the exact thresholds for which evolutionary adaptations will protect species such as 
 <italic class="italic">D. suzukii</italic> from temperature and humidity extremes and the developmental and reproductive trade-offs that may occur from such adaptations.
