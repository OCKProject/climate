 <italic class="italic">Drosophila suzukii</italic> is a relatively recent species-of-concern for soft-skinned fruit producers. While undocumented outside of Japan prior to the 1930s (
 <xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kanzawa, 1936</xref>), it has increased its geographic range rapidly over the past 35 years and can now be found on every continent except for Antartica (
 <xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Asplen et al., 2015</xref>). 
 <italic class="italic">D. suzukii</italic> is particularly concerning because unlike other “vinegar” flies its eggs are deposited preferentially into ripe (or ripening) fruit through the female’s serrated ovipositor (
 <xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Atallah et al., 2014</xref>). Host fruit then spoils due to larval feeding or secondary infection at the puncture site (

 <italic class="italic">D. suzukii</italic> infestation could reach 20% of crop yield or above $5 million (USD) from preferred hosts including strawberries, blueberries, cherries, blackberries and raspberries.
