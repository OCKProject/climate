The principle environmental driver for the model is temperature and key biological mechanisms such as mortality, fecundity and development rates (for each life stage) have been parameterized wherever possible using the laboratory data of 
 <xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ryan et al. (2016)</xref> and other literature-based estimates (
 <xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Emiljanowicz et al., 2014</xref>). The model does not currently account for overwintering so all simulations run for a single year and typically begin with an initial number of adult females introduced on the date when diapause would be terminated due to adequately warm temperatures. Parameterizing the model with observed temperatures from 1993 to 2013, Langille et al. demonstrated potential relative population levels for twelve berry producing regions across Canada and the United States. The goal of that work was to demonstrate that, assuming temperature is a key determinant of population size, not all fruit-producing regions are at equal risk for infestation potential or severity, despite the almost ubiquitous presence of
