<p class="p">Climate change is likely to alter the abundance and distribution of invasive species, via changes in: introduction pathways, effectiveness of management strategies, and altered climatic constraints (

 <xref rid="ref-29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ward &amp; Masters, 2007</xref>) will influence speciesâ€™ ability to survive and thrive in regions for which climate no longer acts as a natural boundary. Invasion and infestation risks may increase as shorter, warmer winters open northern regions to overwintering possibilities and to earlier and longer growth seasons (
 <xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bale et al., 2002</xref>). Conversely, for some species there may be a reduction in suitability as climate factors begin to exceed mortality and development tolerances. Examining the potential changes in abundance and distribution of pest species due to climate change is vital from economic and food-security perspectives (
