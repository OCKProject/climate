  <p class="p">Data are the computed mean normalized total population (all life stages) from all four climate models. Normalization is based on the entire pre-mean data set. White cells located in the interior parts of the maps reflect missing values in the downscaled climate model outputs and a 0.25 degree bi-linear interpolation was applied to all data cells.</p>
