  <title class="title">(A) Mean normalized population distribution across North America per-timeframe. Normalization occurs across the entire data set and mean is across all models and RCPs. (B) Corresponding per-timeframe coefficient of variation across all models and RCPs.</title>
  <p class="p">Coefficient of variation is based on the normalized population data. White cells located in the interior parts of the maps reflect missing values in the downscaled climate model outputs and a 0.25 degree bi-linear interpolation was applied to all data cells.</p>
