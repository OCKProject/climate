<p class="p">As the second largest inland river basin in the arid region of Northwestern China, the HRB plays an important role for the production of commodity grains and the development of the Belt and Road initiative. Both the agricultural irrigation in the middle oasis and the fragile ecosystems in the downstream basin strongly depend on Heihe River water. However, the irrigation water diversion of the middle oasis accounts for more than 80% of the river runoff at Yingluoxia [
 <xref rid="B15-ijerph-16-01706" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. To restore the ecosystems in the downstream HRB, the Ecological Water Diversion Project (EWDP) has been applied since 2002. According to the EWDP, the river water allocated to the middle oasis is to be significantly reduced for increasing runoff discharge. Yet, the total water use is actually not reduced in the middle oasis [
 <xref rid="B16-ijerph-16-01706" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>] due to inappropriate land and water use and management [

 <xref rid="B18-ijerph-16-01706" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. More groundwater is exploited to supplement irrigation. This has resulted in a declining trend in groundwater levels [

 <xref rid="B20-ijerph-16-01706" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>] and the shrinkage of wetland and grassland areas [
 <xref rid="B21-ijerph-16-01706" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>] in the middle oasis. Therefore, how to optimize the water allocation ratio to the middle oasis and increase the agricultural water productivity becomes a challenge to the HRB [
