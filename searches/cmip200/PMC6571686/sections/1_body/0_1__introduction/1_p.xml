<p class="p">Climate change has significant impacts on hydrological, biological, and ecological systems which are all closely related to water resources, causing sustainability concerns around the world. The Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) confirms that warming in the climate system is unequivocal, with many of the observed changes unprecedented over decades to millennia. Temperatures at the Earth’s surface in each of the last three decades has been successively warmer than that in any preceding decade since 1850 [

These facts indicate that future climate change mainly characterized by warming and tightly related with socio-economic development will be of significant global, national and regional importance. Understanding the evolution mechanism of climate change has thus become a priority area, both for research and for water management strategies. In the past 100 years, the increase of the land surface air temperature in China was greater than that of the whole world, especially in the inland regions of Northwest China with an increase &gt;0.5 °C since the 1980s [

Compared with temperature, precipitation and its influencing factors are more complex and uncertain with no consistent trends in Northwest China, which cause much more vulnerability and sensitivity of agricultural water consumption and productivity to climate change [
