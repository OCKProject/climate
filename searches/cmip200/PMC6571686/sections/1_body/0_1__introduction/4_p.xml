<p class="p">Studies concerning hydrology, ecology, and economy have been accordingly conducted to reveal and synergize the complicated relationship of water-agriculture-ecology in the HRB. Kang et al. [
 <xref rid="B23-ijerph-16-01706" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>] demonstrated that water availability and crop production were likely to decrease in the future in response to increasing temperatures and fluctuating precipitation. Cao et al. [
 <xref rid="B24-ijerph-16-01706" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>] conducted a study on corn in the oasis irrigation areas of the Hexi Corridor indicating that the accumulated temperature in irrigated areas in the Hexi Corridor was significantly increased. The accumulated temperature during corn growth is a key factor affecting corn yield. As the climate in the irrigated areas warms, the corn yield in selected local areas has increased. The yield increases, from west to east, were 124%, 186%, and 301%, respectively, however, only one climate factor (temperature) was taken into consideration in this study. Zhao et al. [
 <xref rid="B25-ijerph-16-01706" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>] found that the air temperature in the HRB increased significantly from 1960 to 2009, which was closely correlated with the increasing yields of spring wheat, corn, and cotton, but higher pest population levels. Zhang et al. [
 <xref rid="B26-ijerph-16-01706" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>] investigated the responses of crop water use efficiency (WUE) to climate variables in the semi-arid area of Northern China during 1983–2010, suggesting that the difference of crop WUE in warm-dry environment and in warm-wet environment ranged from 29.0–55.5%. Changes in temperature and precipitation in the past three decades jointly enhanced crop WUE by 8.1–30.6%. Jiang et al. [
 <xref rid="B17-ijerph-16-01706" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>] developed a distributed agro-hydrological model to quantify the combined effects of weather, crop, soil and irrigation factors on irrigation performance and water productivity in the irrigated areas of the milled HRB, which implied that the water productivity was spatially varied and quite small due to excessive irrigation water use. Xu et al. [
 <xref rid="B27-ijerph-16-01706" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>] applied a distributed agro-hydrological model to access the irrigation water use in the major irrigation system of middle HRB, indicating that only 53% of total applied water was efficiently used, whereas deep percolation loss and canal conveyance loss accounted for 22% and 25% of the total applied water, respectively. It has been shown that since the late 1980s, the frequency and intensity of extreme hydrological-meteorological events have increased in Northwest China, which has caused serious adverse effects on local livelihood, such as agricultural production, water resources sustainable management, and food security, and has restricted the regional socio-economic development [

 <xref rid="B29-ijerph-16-01706" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="B30-ijerph-16-01706" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="B31-ijerph-16-01706" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. To sum up, this study aims to evaluate the impacts of climate change on water productivity in the irrigated oases of the middle HRB by: (1) using multi-GCM projections which could effectively reduce uncertainties from GCMs; (2) applying an agro-hydrological model to simulate the crop growth based on different climate change scenarios and crop reference evapotranspiration (

 <sub class="sub">0</sub>) scenarios derived from the Hargreaves equation adjusted by the Penman–Monteith equation; and (3) selecting two typical agricultural production areas to quantify variation patterns of the crop water productivity. Results obtained in this study will be helpful for synergic development of water security and agricultural production in arid inland regions adapt to climate change.
