<p class="p">In terms of the Representative Concentration Pathways emission scenarios (RCPs) according to the radiative forcing target level for 2100, general circulation models (GCMs) provide multiple global large-scale climate information for impact assessment, however, with a relatively coarse spatial resolution. Facing this problem, downscaling methods have been developed to generate higher-resolution climatic factors for regional studies based on GCM outputs [

 <xref rid="B8-ijerph-16-01706" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>] has been widely used to investigate the impacts of regional climate change on water resources. Fan et al. [
 <xref rid="B9-ijerph-16-01706" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>] demonstrated that the SDSM showed a high efficiency for simulating the air temperature in Northern China, indicating a significant trend of increasing air temperature in the future. Compared with the high accuracy of the air temperature, the simulated monthly precipitation by the SDSM exceeded the observed value [

 <xref rid="B11-ijerph-16-01706" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>] applied the SDSM to project the spatio-temporal characteristics of the future air temperatures and precipitation in the Hexi Corridor, implying that the daily maximum, minimum, and mean air temperature (T

 <sub class="sub">min</sub>, T
 <sub class="sub">mean</sub>) all exhibited an increasing trend, while the precipitation showed significant regional variations, declining in the eastern and central parts and increasing in the western part. However, these previous studies have neglected the performance assessment on GCM selection in terms of specific study areas, which could cause great uncertainties in the regional impact evaluation of climate change [

Climate change scenarios generated by Wang et al. [
