<p class="p">Screening downscaling predictors is key to the SDSM, and largely determines the results of downscaling and future climate scenarios [
 <xref rid="B7-ijerph-16-01706" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. The selection of predictors is an iterative process, based on the results of seasonal correlation analysis, partial correlation analysis, and scatterplots. Furthermore, seasonal correlation analysis is conducted by investigating the percentage of variance explained by specific predictandâ€“predictor pairs and by judiciously concerning the most appropriate combination of predictors for a given season and predictand. Partial correlation analysis is used to investigate inter-variable correlations. These statistics help to identify the amount of explanatory power that is unique to each predictor.
