<p class="p">In this study, calibration processes of temperature and precipitation were determined as unconditional and conditional processes, respectively [
 <xref rid="B7-ijerph-16-01706" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. The SDSM was calibrated by artificially inflating the variance inflation (
 <italic class="italic">VIF</italic>) and bias correction (
 <italic class="italic">BC</italic>) of downscaled series based on their change ranges to accord better with daily observations. Furthermore, 0 &lt; 
 <italic class="italic">VIF</italic> &lt; 10 indicates no correlation; 10 &lt; 
 <italic class="italic">VIF</italic> &lt; 100 indicates a moderate correlation; 
 <italic class="italic">VIF</italic> ≥ 100 indicates a high correlation. The 
 <italic class="italic">VIF</italic> default value is 12. The value of 
 <italic class="italic">BC</italic> ranges from 0–2. The BC default value is 1.0, which indicates no bias correction [
