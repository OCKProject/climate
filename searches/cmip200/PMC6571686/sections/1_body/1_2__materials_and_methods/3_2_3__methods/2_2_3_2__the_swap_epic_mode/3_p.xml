<p class="p">The GIS-based SWAP-EPIC was developed through a close coupling of SWAP-EPIC and ArcInfo GIS, using VBA programs in GIS environment by Jiang et al. [
 <xref rid="B17-ijerph-16-01706" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. Thus, the SWAP-EPIC was extended to be used in a distributed manner for regional modeling. The distributed modeling was conducted by identifying a heterogeneous area as an assemblage of individual simulation units with homogenous soil-water-plant-weather representation. Independent runs of SWAP-EPIC model can simulate soil water balance and crop growth and yield in each simulated unit. The detailed description about GIS-based SWAP-EPIC model was given by Jiang et al. [
