<p class="p">SWAP-EPIC was a one-dimensional (1-D) physical-based agro-hydrological model that could simulate soil water flow, solute and heat transport as well as crop growth on a field scale and daily time-step. It was proposed by Xu et al. [
 <xref rid="B27-ijerph-16-01706" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>] through coupling the SWAP (Soil-Water-Atmosphere-Plant) model [
 <xref rid="B45-ijerph-16-01706" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>] and the EPIC (Environmental Policy Integrated Climate) crop growth module [
 <xref rid="B46-ijerph-16-01706" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>], which is a less demanding data input for crop growth modeling and more suitable for regional application. The soil water flow was described based on the 1-D Richards equation for vertical flow. Soil hydraulic properties were described using the van Genuchten [

 <xref rid="B48-ijerph-16-01706" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>] functions. The solute transport and heat transfer were described with the form of convection-dispersion equation and the conduction equation, respectively. The finite-difference solution scheme was applied for both solving the partial differential equations of soil water flow, solute transport, and heat conductance. The modules of soil water flow and crop growth were adopted for the current study. A brief description of the SWAP-EPIC model is provided in this paper, while more detailed theory can be found in [
