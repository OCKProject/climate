 <xref rid="B44-ijerph-16-01706" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. In this study, the performances of the 23 GCMs were evaluated on the basis of the observed monthly precipitation and mean/maximum/minimum air temperatures during 1961â€“2000 from the 17 meteorological stations and the simulated monthly data from GCMs for the same period.
