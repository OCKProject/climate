 <xref rid="B3-ijerph-16-01706" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. The HRB is a typical inland river basin in the arid zone of Northwest China, which originates in the Qilian Mountain region and consists of three sections from south to north: the upstream area is from the Qilian Mountains to the Yingluoxia (outlets of the mountains), the midstream area runs from the Yingluoxia to Zhengyixia, and the downstream area occurs below the Zhengyixia and terminates in the Juyan Lakes (east and west branches, respectively). The study area has strong spatial heterogeneity with diverse ecosystems including an ice-snow zone, frozen soil, mountain forest, oasis, desert, and desert riparian forest [

 <xref rid="B34-ijerph-16-01706" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. The HRB is characterized by a continental climate. According to different regions, the average annual air temperature is from 2–3 °C in the upper HRB, from 6–8 °C in the middle HRB, and from 8 °C to 10 °C in the lower HRB. The mean annual precipitation is from 200–500 mm, from 120–200 mm, and below 50 mm in the upstream, midstream, and most downstream areas, respectively [
