<p class="p">As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01706-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>, the 
 <italic class="italic">RS</italic> values for the precipitation, T
 <sub class="sub">mean,</sub> T
 <sub class="sub">max</sub>, and T
 <sub class="sub">min</sub> showed significant differences in the 23 GCMs. The GCM showing the best simulation effect of precipitation was the CNRM-CM5 (
 <italic class="italic">RS</italic> = 7.15), while the GCMs displaying best performance of the T
 <sub class="sub">mean,</sub> T
 <sub class="sub">max</sub>, and T
 <sub class="sub">min</sub> were the CCSM4 (
 <italic class="italic">RS</italic> = 8.55), MPI-ESM-LR (
 <italic class="italic">RS</italic> = 6.33), and BCC-CSM1-1-M (
 <italic class="italic">RS</italic> = 6.93), respectively. Compared with significant differences of precipitation performances in 23 GCMs (
 <italic class="italic">RS</italic> values ranged from 2.99–7.15), GCM performances of air temperatures showed to be relatively consistent, of which the 
 <italic class="italic">RS</italic> values were all above 5.0 for the T
 <sub class="sub">mean</sub>, while the 
 <italic class="italic">RS</italic> values for the T
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> and T
 <sub class="sub">min</sub> ranged from 3.43–6.33 and from 3.32–6.93, respectively. In this study, the MPI-ESM-MR (
 <italic class="italic">RS</italic> = 8.28) was finally selected to project the future T
 <sub class="sub">mean</sub> instead of the CCSM4 with the highest 
 <italic class="italic">RS</italic> value (
 <italic class="italic">RS</italic> = 8.55) due to its lacunae in long-term time series of the T
 <sub class="sub">mean</sub>. To sum up, CNRM-CM5, MPI-ESM-MR, MPI-ESM-LR, and BCC-CSM1-1-M were used to project the future precipitation, T
 <sub class="sub">mean,</sub> T
 <sub class="sub">max</sub>, and T
 <sub class="sub">min</sub> in the HRB, respectively.
