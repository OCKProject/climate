<p class="p">Different from higher increases of the T
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> than those of the T
 <sub class="sub">min</sub> under the RCP 2.6 and RCP 4.5 scenarios, the increases of the T
 <sub class="sub">min</sub> at some stations were higher than those of the T
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> under the RCP8.5 scenario, including Yumen Town (1.76 °C), Jinta (1.84 °C), and Jiuquan (1.75 °C). Areas with relatively small increases of the T
 <sub class="sub">min</sub> included Jikede, Yeniugou, Yongchang, Gangcha, and Mengyuan. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01706-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>, the highest increase of the T
 <sub class="sub">min</sub> situated in the southwestern mountainous area. However, in contrast to the spatial variation patterns of the T
 <sub class="sub">mean</sub> and T
 <sub class="sub">max</sub>, T
 <sub class="sub">min</sub> rose the most in the middle reaches. Referring to 
 <xref rid="ijerph-16-01706-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>, compared with the reference period, the T
 <sub class="sub">min</sub> during the future period under RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 all increased by 1.08 °C, 1.18 °C, and 1.68 °C, respectively.
