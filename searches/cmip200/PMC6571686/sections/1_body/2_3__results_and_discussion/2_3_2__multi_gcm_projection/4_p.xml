<p class="p">As shown in

 <sub class="sub">max</sub> of all the stations in the HRB showed an upward trend with a considerable rise. The highest temperature rise was in the Qilian area, where the T

 <xref rid="ijerph-16-01706-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> indicated that the T
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> under the three RCP scenarios increased by 1.23 째C, 1.35 째C, and 1.55 째C, respectively, which was more remarkable than the increase of the mean annual air temperature.
