<p class="p">As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01706-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>, compared with the reference period, the T
 <sub class="sub">mean</sub> during the future period under RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 all showed an increasing tendency, which was more significant as the concentration of RCP increased, i.e., RCP8.5 &gt; RCP4.5 &gt; RCP2.6. The T
 <sub class="sub">mean</sub> increased more than 1 °C under both RCP4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios while, under the RCP2.6 scenario, the increase of the T
 <sub class="sub">mean</sub> exhibited a relative lower value (&lt;1 °C). From the regional perspective, the greatest temperature increase located in Ejin Banner, Jikede, Shandan, Yumen Town, and Qilian. Temperature increase was comparatively less in Gaotai, Yongchang, and Gangcha. The T
 <sub class="sub">mean</sub> in the southern mountainous areas of the HRB was relatively low, while the temperature in the northern desert was comparatively high, with the T
 <sub class="sub">mean</sub> increasing gradually from the southwest to the northeast. As shown in 
 <xref rid="ijerph-16-01706-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>, compared with the reference period, the annual T
 <sub class="sub">mean</sub> during the next 30 years increased by 0.84 °C, 1.14 °C, and 1.28 °C under the three scenarios, respectively, with the most significant temperature rise being in areas located in the lower reaches of the HRB, including Jikede, Ejin Banner, and Guaizihu.
