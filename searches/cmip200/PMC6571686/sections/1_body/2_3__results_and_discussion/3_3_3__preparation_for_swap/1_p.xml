<p class="p">The Gaotai and Ganzhou irrigated areas situated in the middle reaches of the HRB were selected as the typical oasis agricultural areas in this study for crop water productivity evaluation under climate change. As the national maize seed production base in these two areas, the water consumption of maize is of significant importance for water saving in agriculture. In this study, maize was chosen as the crop to be simulated in the SWAP-EPIC model and the actual irrigation scheduling used in the field experiment in 2012 was adopted. Under the three future climate scenarios, the irrigation schedule remained unchanged while the climate variables were changed to analyze impacts of climate change on the water productivity of maize in the oasis agricultural areas.</p>
