 <xref rid="ijerph-16-01706-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref> showed the inter-decadal maize yields under the three RCP scenarios in the Gaotai area. The mean annual maize yield simulated was 12,806 kg/ha from 2012–2015, while the mean inter-decadal maize yields under the three future climate scenarios simulated from 2021–2030 and from 2031–2040 were both lower than the historical simulation results, which caused the overall decrease of the maize yield in the future 30 years. Although there was a decrease of the maize yield in the future, which was compared with the yield in the historical period, the future inter-decadal maize yield in the Gaotai area under the scenarios of RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 gradually increased with time while, under the RCP4.5 scenario, the inter-decadal maize yield (12,204 kg/ha) in the early period was higher than that (11,924 kg/ha) in the middle period.
