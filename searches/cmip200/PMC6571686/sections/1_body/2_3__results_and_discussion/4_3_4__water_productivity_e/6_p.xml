 <xref rid="ijerph-16-01706-t006" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref> shows the inter-decadal CWC of maize in the Ganzhou area under the three future climate scenarios. Similar to the simulation results of the inter-decadal CWC of maize in the Gaotai area, the mean CWC of maize in Ganzhou was 686.3 mm from 2012â€“2015, and the inter-decadal mean CWC of maize under all future climate scenarios of RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 was lower than that of the reference period. The inter-decadal mean CWC of maize gradually increased with time under the RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 scenarios, while under the RCP4.5 scenario, the inter-decadal CWC of maize (559.5 mm) in the middle period was lower than that in the early and later periods.
