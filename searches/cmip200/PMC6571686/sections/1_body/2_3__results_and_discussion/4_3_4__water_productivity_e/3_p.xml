 <xref rid="ijerph-16-01706-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref> showed the inter-decadal CWC of maize under the three RCP scenarios in the Gaotai area. The CWC of maize from 2012â€“2015 was 677.7 mm, while under the RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 scenarios, the inter-decadal CWC was lower than the historical simulation results. Similar to the simulation results of the inter-decadal maize yield in Gaotai, the inter-decadal CWC of maize gradually increased with time under the RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 scenarios, while under the RCP4.5 scenario, the inter-decadal CWC of maize (556.4 mm) in the middle period was lower than that in the early and later periods. Inconsistency between decreased maize yield/CWC and projected increases in air temperatures might be attributed to the fluctuating decreases of precipitation under the three RCP scenarios (
