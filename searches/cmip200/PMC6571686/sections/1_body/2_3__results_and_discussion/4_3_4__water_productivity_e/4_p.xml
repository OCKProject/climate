 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01706-f008" class="xref">Figure 8</xref> shows changes of the mean annual maize yield and CWC under the three RCP scenarios in the Ganzhou area compared with simulation results from 2012–2015. Different from the increases of the mean annual maize yield with the rates of 2.51% and 2.3% under RCP4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios, the mean annual maize yield under the RCP2.6 scenario exhibited a decreasing trend. Similar with changing patterns of the CWC in the Gaotai area, the mean annual CWC in the Ganzhou area showed a declining trend under all three RCP scenarios with the highest decreasing rates of RCP4.5 (−16.27%) and the lowest decreasing rates of RCP8.5 (−15.32%).
