 <xref rid="ijerph-16-01706-t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>. The mean maize yield simulated in Ganzhou was 11,504 kg/ha from 2012–2015, and the inter-decadal maize yields under the three future climate scenarios gradually increased with time. During the early period (2021–2030) under the three RCP scenarios, the maize yield was lower than the historical simulation results, while the maize yields in the middle and later periods (2031–2041 and 2041–2050) were higher than the historical simulation results.
