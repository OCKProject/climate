<p class="p">The resulting atmospheric GHG concentrations closely mirror the results of CMIP5 runs (fig. S2) for the most part, although there is some divergence in high emissions (RCP 6 and RCP 8.5) scenarios where changes in ocean chemistry associated with acidification reduce the airborne fraction in a manner not captured by our emulator model. For this analysis, however, because we are looking at small perturbations in the net CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions of underlying RCP scenarios, the limitations of the simple atmospheric carbon cycle model used should be minimal. We did not explicitly consider feedbacks or interactions between carbon sequestration and other GHG emissions (methane and nitrous oxide, in particular). These fluxes were poorly constrained for most of the land uses considered here, and thus, this was beyond the scope of the current analysis.
