<p class="p">We used a climate model that has been used previously in the literature (

 </xref>) to evaluate the impact of emissions or emission reductions/C sequestration on future transient climate responses (fig. S1). The model takes a particular emission scenario for three major GHGs (CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>, and N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O) and converts these emissions into atmospheric concentrations, radiative forcing, and transient temperature response. This emulator model has the benefit of enabling us to consider many possible permutations of sequestration rates and effective sequestration years while matching the global mean surface temperature response found in more complex ESMs such as those included in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) featured in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 5th Assessment Report (IPCC AR5; fig. S1). As a single run of a coupled ESM would take 5 days, it would be prohibitively difficult to perform the 6800 separate combinations of sequestration rates and effective sequestration years examined in this paper.
