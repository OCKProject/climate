Reduction in warming associated with sequestration rates was calculated from the difference between the temperatures at a given point in time between the unperturbed and perturbed RCP scenario. We did not consider the potential effects of temperature change on SOC dynamics as this was beyond the scope of this study. These effects are poorly constrained, and different studies find both increases and decreases of the SOC stock with warming (
