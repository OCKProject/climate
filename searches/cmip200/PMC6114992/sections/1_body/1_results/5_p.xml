  <italic class="italic">12</italic>

If we assume that the maximum soil C sequestration potential is equivalent to the amount of C that has been lost from soils due to land use, then soils globally would have the capacity to store an additional 0.9 Pg C year

To determine the impact of effective sequestration years on a given soil C sequestration rate from any combination of management strategies, we assessed the effect of the number of effective sequestration years (from 1 to 85) on the year 2100 global mean surface temperatures for the range of SOC sequestration rates (0 to 2.0 Pg C year
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) previously considered (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>). In practice, SOC sequestration rates would likely exhibit a gradual decline over time, and the shape of this decline would likely vary by land use, climate, and soil type and is not well understood (
