<p class="p">The model shows that a global SOC sequestration rate of 0.68 Pg C year
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> from 2015 to 2100 would be required to yield a 0.1°C reduction in mean surface temperature in target year 2100 when coupled with an aggressive emission reduction scenario [Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 2.6; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>]. These results assumed a constant sequestration rate to the target year. The 0.68 Pg C year
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> global sequestration rate is at the low end of the ranges of published estimates, which vary from a low of 0.36 Pg C year
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> to a high of 1.56 Pg C year

 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. It is important to note that, while the model assumes constant annual rates of SOC sequestration at a global scale, it does not require constant rates at individual sites.
