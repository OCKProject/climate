<p class="p">In practice, rates of SOC sequestration are likely to decline over time at any one site as soils reach new equilibria (
 <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">20</italic>
 </xref>), but the time scale and shape of these declines are not well constrained by data and are likely to vary significantly among locations and management practices. To help bound this uncertainty, we model the effects of SOC sequestration on global surface temperature with and without consideration of effective sequestration years, defined as the number of years it would take to reach the maximum SOC stock (SOC max) at the current potential sequestration rate (see fig. S3). The SOC max is a concept proposed by Six 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. (
 <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">21</italic>
 </xref>) and is poorly constrained by data at both site and global scales. An SOC max provides a theoretical limit on the amount of SOC storage in soils. As opposed to applying an arbitrary SOC max at a fixed time period (for example, 20 or 50 years), we model effective sequestration years as a continuum of time periods required to reach an SOC max (from 0 to 85 years) for a range of SOC sequestration rates. The current potential sequestration rate was taken from values reported in the literature (table S1). Our analysis focuses specifically on the temperature response to SOC sequestration. SOC storage is sensitive to a suite of global change factors such as elevated atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration and changes in climate, among others (

  <italic class="italic">22</italic>
 </xref>, 
 <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">23</italic>
 </xref>). These factors will likely have additional, albeit poorly constrained, impacts on management-induced SOC sequestration (

  <italic class="italic">24</italic>
 </xref>). Our goal here is not to quantify the ecological controls on SOC storage and loss in agricultural ecosystems but to determine the magnitude of SOC sequestration needed at a global scale to meaningfully affect temperatures and to explore the sensitivity of atmospheric temperature change to a range of possible temporal limits to soil C sequestration (effective sequestration years).
