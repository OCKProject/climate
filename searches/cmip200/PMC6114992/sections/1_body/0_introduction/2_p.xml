<p class="p">Here, we use a climate model emulator to translate SOC sequestration from agricultural management into a range of potential global mean surface temperature changes over time, consistent with global-scale outputs from the latest generation of Earth system models (ESMs; see Materials and Methods and fig. S1). Much of the research to date on the potential of land useâ€“based SOC sequestration has focused on quantifying current sequestration rates with the implicit assumption that rates remain constant over time, often assuming a constrained time period of 20 to 50 years (

The potential for SOC sequestration to contribute to a portfolio of mitigation strategies aimed at reducing climate change depends not only on the rates soon after C sequestering practices are implemented but also on the time-integrated dynamics of those rates, that is, how quickly land-use changes can be adopted, how long they remain in effect, and how SOC stocks change over time (
