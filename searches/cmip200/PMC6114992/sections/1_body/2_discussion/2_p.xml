<p class="p">Management-based soil C sequestration strategies were significantly more effective at reducing global warming under RCP 2.6 due to the atmospheric saturation of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> in high emission scenarios (for example, in RCP 8.5). This result points to the value of combining aggressive emission reduction with C removal strategies for climate change mitigation. The management strategies we evaluated here are different from the measures assumed in the modeled RCP scenarios (

 </xref>) and therefore provide additional negative emissions if applied simultaneously with emission reductions. The RCP scenarios can be realized through many alternative energy, land-use, and land-cover pathways, but current IAMs largely rely on land-cover change (for example, afforestation) and C capture and storage technology combined with bioenergy (BECCS) to reach goals of reduced radiative forcing (

  <italic class="italic">50</italic>
 </xref>). In contrast, this study examined the effects of improving management practices on agricultural land currently in production. We note that future changes in the overall size of the agricultural land area will affect the area amenable to these practices and that heavy reliance on bioenergy could compete with some management activities on cropland or grazing land. This is one reason that we emphasize consideration of a large range of possible sequestration rates and time frames. Extensive adoption of land management strategies could moderately reduce the need for BECCS, which is considered extensively in most 1.5° and 2°C target scenarios (
