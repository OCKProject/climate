<p class="p">Our analysis also points to the importance of the long-term potential for SOC sequestration. The largely underappreciated scientific uncertainty of effective sequestration years greatly affected the climate change mitigation potential of land management strategies. A better understanding of the long-term regional potential of specific management applications for C sequestration, as well as the controls and limits on C sequestration, will facilitate better predictions of future land-atmosphere C cycle feedbacks and also inform the potential for long-term stabilization of C beyond the 2100 temperature target. As new strategies are identified for sequestering C through land management such as repurposing urban and rural nutrient and C waste streams (
