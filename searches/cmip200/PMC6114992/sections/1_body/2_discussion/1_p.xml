<p class="p">Our results show that existing management strategies on current agricultural lands have the potential to reduce global temperatures by the end of the century, sequestering as much as 1.78 Pg C year
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. This rate of sequestration could result in warming reductions of as much as 0.26°C in 2100 (assuming an effective sequestration period of at least 85 years). These model results are dependent on the effective sequestration years at a global scale and concurrent trends in emission reduction. The time horizon of SOC sequestration is poorly understood but is critical for determining the long-term viability of these approaches. In particular, we note that climate change is a millennial-scale phenomenon that stretches beyond the 2100 target. Therefore, the residence time of organic C in soils, which can affect the long-term efficacy of SOC sequestration (
