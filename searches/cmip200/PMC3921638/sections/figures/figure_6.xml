  <title class="title">Multi-decadal variability expressed in terms of Cramer's t-statistics in observation and climate simulations in terms of area averaged (D2, continental India) seasonal rainfall with running average from (a) multiple observations and their composite (b) climate simulations from CMIP5 and CMIP3 based on the climate models ability to simulate the observed seasonal trends and mean (both the seasonal and annual) rainfall (c) CMIP3 (24 models) simulations (d) CMIP5 (21 models) simulations.</title>
  <p class="p">The thick line represents respective composite. The percentage of climate simulations that simulated the phase of multi-decadal variability is shown in both CMIP3 and CMIP5, while the simulations simulate both phases are shown near to the sub-title.</p>
