  <title class="title">Seasonal (June-September) observed (composite of multiple observations) mean rainfall and the trends over different regions in the summer monsoon region are compared with the simulated mean and trends from CMIP3 and CMIP5 models.</title>
  <p class="p">D1–D4 is the rainfall average over continental India and D5 shows the rainfall over the continental India plus ocean. The region D2–D4 clearly shows the observed mean rainfall and the trends over continental India don't show much variation, as they indicate the core monsoon region.</p>
