  <title class="title">Distribution of the climate simulations from CMIP3 (blue dots) and CMIP5 (red dots) in the plane spanned by the difference (error) in simulated and observed correlation (x-axis) and the difference in simulated and observed seasonal mean rainfall (left y-axis) and trend (right y axis) during 1951â€“2005.</title>
  <p class="p">The values in the left y-axis are shown as percentage of their respective observed composite. The errors in simulated historical trends are shown as % of the observed trend on the right y-axis. The black rectangle defines the spread in observed values along the axis; the orange rectangle defines the acceptable range along each axis by including spread in the observation plus the significance of the correlation.</p>
