  <title class="title">Trends in the seasonal (June-September) and the annual rainfall over continental India (CIM: D2: 70-85E, 10-30N) and continental India plus ocean (D5: 60-95E, 10S-30N) from CMIP5 (left panels), CMIP3 (right panels) climate model simulations compared with the trends in the multiple observations (middle panel) for the period (1951–2005); the trends are expressed as % of respective standard deviation for the period.</title>
  <p class="p">For the observations the trend in the different composites (highlighted, yellow) represent average of all (green), high significance (P &lt; 0.01, orange) and low significance (P &lt; 0.05, purple) ensembles. The percentage of models that simulated significant negative trend as against the total number of significant trends (positive and negative) is shown in each panel; the numbers in the brackets show the % of the total simulations with negative trend (as observed) in the respective case. The blue, red and black lines indicate, respectively, significant (P &lt; 0.2) positive trend, significant (P &lt; 0.2) negative trend and insignificant (P &gt; 0.2) trends. The dash line indicates the observed composite trend and the grey band shows the dispersion (1 σ) in the observed trends.</p>
