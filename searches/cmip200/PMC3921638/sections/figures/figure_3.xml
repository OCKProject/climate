  <p class="p">(a) Distribution of historical (1951–2005) simulations in seasonal and annual rainfall over continental India (D2) for CMIP5 (red, uppercase) and CMIP3 (blue, lower case) in terms of the difference (simulation – observed composite) as percentage of the corresponding observed composite. The dispersion in the observations (green) is shown in terms of the difference (observation – observed composite) as percentage of the observed composite. The adopted acceptable uncertainty is defined by the difference (Δ) between the maximum and the minimum in the observed values, centered at the observed composite; the inner shaded box (pink) is defined by 1Δ, while the outer square (green) is defined by 2Δ. The inset table shows the number of simulations that fall in each category. (b) Inter-annual variability in Continental Indian Monsoon (CIM) rainfall from the composite observations and ensemble of simulations (normalized to the respective 1951–2005 mean). The linear trend for the respective case is given in the bracket.</p>
