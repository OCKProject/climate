<p class="p">In this study we use Cramer's test is to examine the stability of a long-term record in terms of comparison between the overall mean of an entire record and the mean of the certain part of the record (WMO 1966). The statistical significance of the moving mean as well as decadal averages was examined using the Cramer's test statistics as follows:

 </inline-formula> is the mean for the total number of years and 
 <italic class="italic">σ</italic> is the standard deviation of the series for the total number of years (N) under investigation; 
 <inline-formula id="m3" class="inline-formula">
  <inline-graphic id="d33e517" xlink:href="srep04071-m3.jpg" class="inline-graphic" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/>
 </inline-formula> is the mean for each successive n-year. The statistic t
 <sub class="sub">k</sub> is distributed as ‘Student's t’ with N-2 degrees of freedom. This test may be repeated for any desired number and choice of sub periods in the whole record. The time plot of the t-value gives the pictorial representation of variability.
