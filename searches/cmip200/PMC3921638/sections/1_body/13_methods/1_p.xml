 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10" class="xref">10</xref>. The climate model projections from CMIP5 (scenarios B1, A1B, A2) and CMIP5 (scenarios RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, RCP8.5) are used in this study. The climate model codes are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1" class="xref">Table S1</xref>. The observed daily gridded (1° × 1°) rainfall dataset is adopted from the India Meteorological Department (IMDG) for the period 1951–2004 over India

Monthly rainfall on a 2.5-degree global grid from 1979 to the present is adopted from Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) based on over 6,000 rain gauge stations, and satellite geostationary and low-orbit infrared, passive microwave, and sounding observations
