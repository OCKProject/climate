<p class="p">As noted earlier, quantification and assessment of reliability of any projection is a challenge as the projection cannot be immediately verified like a short-term forecast. This challenge is particularly greater for climate projections due to the presence of (non-linear) trends. In particular, variation of trends in different epochs due to low-frequency variability introduces additional uncertainties. However, it is reasonable and logical to expect that the model simulations reproduce current trends with sufficient accuracy; this argument can be further strengthened through examination of consistency between cross-epochal trends. For a quantitative measure of reliability of projection, we adopt accuracy in the simulation of the historical trends. We have adopted a hierarchical approach to identify reliability of trends, based on increasingly demanding metrics, than on a single parameter like absolute error. An objective here is to assess the reliability of the projections at regional scale relevant for application, specifically to CIM. To avoid any ambiguity due to the selection of geographical coverage as well as to ensure relevance of the results for application, we consider only continental Indian monsoon (CIM) rainfall (June-September); this also allows a robust analysis with multiple sets of observation (
