<p class="p">There have been several works on evaluation of CMIP3 projections in different contexts
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30" class="xref">30</xref>, and sometimes with limited number of models
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31" class="xref">31</xref>. It is generally noted that the confidence in the projections of rainfall is lower than that in temperature
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30" class="xref">30</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31" class="xref">31</xref>. The similarity in the projections of global temperature changes from CMIP3 and CMIP5 models was also noted
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16" class="xref">16</xref>. However, rarely the question of reliability of the projections (in terms of accuracy in simulating current trends) has been addressed; at the same time, as noted earlier quality of simulation of mean and variability does not imply accurate simulation of trends. We address this issue with a hierarchical evaluation. An equally important question addressed here is whether, and how much, progress has been achieved in CMIP5 in projecting regional systems like CIM; this question has not been unambiguously addressed due to arbitrary choice of monsoon domains in many studies. The results are expected to identify methodology and directions for more reliable, and applicable
