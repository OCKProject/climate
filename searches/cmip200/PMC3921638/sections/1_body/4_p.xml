<p class="p">An analysis of expected future pulse of the Indian monsoon climate based on observational and CMIP3 projections was used to claim
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16" class="xref">16</xref> that the Indian monsoon rainfall in the latter half of the 21th century may be very similar to the current monsoon in terms of amount. However, the analysis was based on only CMIP3 simulations; nor were trends, nor any other measure, considered to ascertain reliability (or confidence). It has been already noted that projected global temperature change in CMIP5 is remarkably similar to that from those from CMIP3
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17" class="xref">17</xref>; in spite of substantial effort in model development and improved computational capacity, there has been no significant change in the local model spread.
