<p class="p">An evaluation of the Indian summer monsoon rainfall for the period 1850 to 2100 in 20 CMIP5 models showed
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14" class="xref">14</xref> a consistent increase in summer monsoon mean rainfall; essentially all models were reported to simulate stronger seasonal mean rainfall in the future compared to the historic period under different RCP scenarios, with the highest increase under strongest warming scenario RCP8.5. However, a consensus among models does not necessarily imply reliability of the projections. Similarly, analysis of regional monsoonal rainfall and their changes in the 21st century under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios from 29 CMIP5 climate models showed
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7" class="xref">7</xref> that the global monsoon precipitation intensity and the global monsoon total precipitation are also projected to increase. However, as noted
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7" class="xref">7</xref>, the limited ability of the models to reproduce the current monsoon climate, along with the large scatter among the simulations, imply only low confidence in the projections.
