<p class="p">An evaluation of simulations of Asian summer monsoon from 25 CMIP5 and 22 CMIP3 simulations of the late twentieth Century was reported in terms of time-mean, climatological annual cycle, interannual variability, and intraseasonal variability
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10" class="xref">10</xref>. However, no comparative evaluation in terms of trends was reported. Besides, as noted earlier, the characteristics for CIM can be very different from those for a larger system like the Asian monsoon. Certain improvements, such as in simulation of seasonality, have been reported in CMIP5 over CMIP3
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" class="xref">15</xref>, with most CMIP5 models correctly simulating very low rainfall rates outside of the monsoon season.
