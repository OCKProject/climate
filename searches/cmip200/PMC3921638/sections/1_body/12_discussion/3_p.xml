<p class="p">We have refrained from assigning any definite cause(s) for the decrease in rainfall during 1951–1975 as there are many interacting complex processes as well as a spectrum of natural variability at different time periods. It could be argued, based on the similarity of trends during 1951–1975 and those during 1975–2005, that aerosol or anthropogenic sources may not have significant contribution to the declining trends in CIM in the current epoch; however, there is some evidence

However, definitive attribution is difficult as the precise amplitudes and the phases of the low-frequency variability are not known. The enhanced scope in the CMIP5 models may enable addressing a wider spectrum of applications
