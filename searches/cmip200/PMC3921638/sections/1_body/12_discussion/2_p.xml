<p class="p">A major aspect of hierarchical evaluation is based on validation of simulated trends against observed trends in CIM rainfall for assessing confidence in future-climate simulations. We should emphasize that such a validation of simulated trends certainly provides a necessary requirement; but not necessarily a sufficient condition. Analysis of climate indices shows that in both CMIP5 and CMIP3 certain common processes at large and regional scales show consistency with skill in simulation (

Similarly, other parameters in addition to phases of multi-decadal oscillation and multi-epoch trend can be included for enhanced confidence.
