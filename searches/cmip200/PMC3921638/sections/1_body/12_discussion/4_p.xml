<p class="p">The current analysis is based on simulations with a single initial condition from each model. However, use of multiple simulations with different initial conditions, may not change the basic conclusions, especially since the current simulations also use different initial conditions; however, this issue needs to be explored. As against the natural system, the correlations, trends etc in the simulations are a result of the model dynamics that is not necessarily identical across the models. Thus, each model will need independent analysis and improvement. Finally, our results suggest a metric (application) based evaluation of climate models rather than looking for a best model that performs well for all metrics. Quite clearly, a metric for CIM rainfall may not be adequate for comparing spatial patterns that are more useful for application; however, more elaborate comparison will require climate simulations of adequate skill. While these issues are definitely challenging, they need to be properly addressed given the importance of climate projections.</p>
