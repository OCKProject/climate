<p class="p">An accurate simulation of the observed trends is a primary indicator of reliability of projections for future climate. Our results show that no significant progress has been achieved in our ability to simulate basic quantities like observed seasonal mean and trend, and hence to project the regional climate system, namely CIM, with reasonable certainty. It is normally expected that an ensemble of simulations, statistically, would provide a more reliable result than any of the individual simulations; given that the (equal-weight) ensemble from either CMIP3 or CMIP5 does not provide a more accurate simulation, there is an urgent need for redesigning multi-model ensemble. Given that CMIP5 have poorer quality than the CMIP3 in simulating the observed features of CIM, a critical look at our strategy for model improvement is also required. A silver lining is the consistency across the large number of simulations in terms of association between simulations and climate indices. Such consistency provides an objective way of assessing reliability of climate projections based on physical and mechanistic understanding; such approaches are necessary to offset any effect of non-stationarity of observed trends in assessing projections. However, while the quality of the simulations in terms of various metrics might not have improved, the CMIP5 simulations can be argued to be based on a more comprehensive and refined knowledge base
