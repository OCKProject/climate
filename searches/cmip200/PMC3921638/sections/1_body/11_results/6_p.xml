<p class="p">To further examine the robustness and the consistency of the results, we have analyzed trends in different epochs. Multi-epochal analysis of trends for CMIP ensembles as well as the selected models shows (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2" class="xref">Table 2</xref>) that both CMIP composites and the selected models provide epochal trends consistent with the observed trends. Both CMIP ensembles (except for CMIP5 ensemble for 1951–1975) show only weak and often positive trends for all the three epochs against significant observed negative trends (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). In contrast, the ensembles of selected models show significant negative trends for each epoch (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Similarly, four selected models show generally significant negative trends for each epoch consistent with the corresponding observed trends. In particular, epoch-wise trends are consistent with the long-period (1951–2005) trends (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). This strengthens our argument that epochal trends provide a measure of reliability of simulation of future trends; however, epochal trends cannot be used readily as evaluation criteria due to various uncertainties.
