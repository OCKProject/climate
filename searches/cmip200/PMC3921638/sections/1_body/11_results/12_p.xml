<p class="p">The monsoon rainfall also exhibits prominent multi-decadal variability
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37" class="xref">37</xref>; thus epochal trends are modulated by the phase of the multi-decadal variability. The quality of simulations of multi-decadal variability can be thus another important measure of quality of the CMIP simulations. The multi-decadal climate variability in area averaged (Land only: 70-85E; 10-30N) seasonal rainfall for the period 1901–2005, represented as Cramer's t-statistic
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38" class="xref">38</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39" class="xref">39</xref> shows (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6" class="xref">Fig. 6</xref>) that both CMIP3 and CMIP5 simulations (selected and ensemble) exhibit multi-decadal variability with characteristics similar to those in composite observation. It also clarifies the hazards of trying to break up the inter decadal behavior with an arbitrary dividing date such as 1975 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3b</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6" class="xref">Fig. 6</xref>). The selected simulations show a much higher degree of coherence (similar phase) than the rest of the simulations; in particular, the all-simulation ensemble of CMIP3 does not exhibit the observed characteristics (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6" class="xref">Fig. 6</xref>); interestingly, the all-simulation ensemble of CMIP5 shows a decadal variability but with phases essentially opposite to those of observation or ensemble of selected CMIP5 models (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>). While 76% of CMIP5 simulations simulate positive phase of slow time-scale variability during 1920–1955 and 67% show negative phase for the period 1956–2000, only 62% of simulations show both phases (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6" class="xref">Fig. 6d</xref>). On the other hand, CMIP3 simulates ~50% of the simulations show the phases individually; it poorly simulates (25%) both the phases of slow variability (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6" class="xref">Fig. 6c</xref>). While the epochal trends may have various uncertainties such as due to low-frequency (decadal) variability, and cannot be used readily for model evaluation, it is interesting, and encouraging, that simulations that satisfy the other acceptability criteria also perform well in terms of simulation of low-frequency variability. In particular, the models selected based on hierarchical assessment, one each from CMIP5 (L) and CMIP3 (s), simulate both the phases and the amplitudes reasonably well, while others do not.
