<p class="p">Where σ is defined as the dispersion in observation is defined as the difference between maximum and minimum value divided by 2. A comparison of the trends of the continental India (CIM: D3, 70-85E, 5-30N, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2a</xref>) and CIM plus ocean (D5:60-94E, 10S-30N, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2b</xref>) for the period 1951–2005 shows that all the seven observations show significant negative trends for CIM seasonal rainfall (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2a</xref>, middle panels) but positive trends for the larger domains (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2b</xref>, middle panels). Thus the decreasing trend in the seasonal rainfall is highly regional effect, as also earlier noted
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" class="xref">15</xref>. These negative trends are well captured by some of the simulations in both the CMIP5 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2a</xref>, left panel) and CMIP3 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2a</xref>, right panels). The symbols A-U/a-x used to represent the individual CMIP3/CMIP5 climate model simulations as described in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1" class="xref">Table S1</xref>. However, while all-member ensemble shows show insignificant negative trends as observed, the CMIP3 ensembles show opposite trends (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2a</xref> right panels), essentially due to a few simulations with large positive trends. In terms of the larger domain, both CMIP5 and CMIP3 ensembles show positive trends as observed, but not significant as the observed trends. For the CMIP5 models, however, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2a</xref> (top left) shows that, out of the 21 models considered, only nine reproduce the negative trend as observed; only five of these trends (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2a</xref>, top left panel) are of statistical significance (P &lt; 0.2) and comparable to the observed trend (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2a</xref>, top middle, P &lt; 0.05). In particular, none of the CMIP5 ensembles (thick arrows, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2a</xref>) satisfies the criterion of even negative trend. The result is no different for the annual rainfall; thus, the lack of skill for CIM rainfall cannot be attributed to shifts in the seasonal rainfall in the simulations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2a</xref>, bottom left).
