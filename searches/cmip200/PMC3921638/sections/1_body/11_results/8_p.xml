<p class="p">Comparison of the large-scale indices (ENSO index and the LETG-SA) from the simulations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4a</xref>, brown and green bars, respectively) with the corresponding observed values (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4a</xref>, middle panel) shows that while many (16) of the CMIP3 simulations reproduce observed negative CC (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3a</xref>, top panel) at 99% significant level, only a few (10) CMIP5 simulations show this observed characteristic (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4a</xref>, bottom panel). In particular, the CMIP3 ensemble shows a negative ENSO-CIM index at more than 99% significance level; for the CMIP5 ensemble this significance is ~95% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4a</xref>, thick brown bars). With respect to LETG-SA, the CMIP3 ensemble produces a positive CC as observed, but with low significance; for CMIP5 ensemble, this CC is zero (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4a</xref>, thick green bars). Further, only CMIP3 ensemble shows LETG-SA index of the same sign and significance as that of the observed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4a</xref>). Thus the CMIP5 simulations have in general poorer quality than the CMIP3 simulations in reproducing the observed association between large-scale processes and CIM. Similar conclusions also hold for distribution of simulations for the regional process (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4b</xref>). In terms of the IOD index, eight of the CMIP3 models simulate values similar to the observed
