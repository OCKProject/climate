 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3" class="xref">Table 3</xref>) in terms of correlation coefficients (CC) between CIM rainfall and (a) sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies over NINO3.4 region (ENSO-CIM index), (b) Land equator thermal gradient over South Asia (LETG-SA index), (c) deep tropospheric thermal difference (DTTD index), (d) Land equator thermal gradient over India (LETG-IND index) and (e) difference in east-west SST difference (IOD index). The +ve/âˆ’ve index means the relationship between interannual variability of CIM rainfall and regional/large-scale climate indicators.
