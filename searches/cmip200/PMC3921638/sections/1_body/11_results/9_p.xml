<p class="p">As noted earlier, the acceptability of the simulation in terms of mean or variability and that with respect to trend needs to be considered separately. We next consider the difference between the observed and the simulated seasonal rainfall and difference between observed and simulated correlation coefficients (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>). Distribution of the simulations in this plane shows most of the CMIP5 simulations to have either positive or negative bias; however, the average bias is quite small (10% of the observed composite). In contrast, CMIP3 simulations show distinct negative bias (underestimation) in seasonal mean rainfall (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>, left panels); while this may be related to the basic design (forcings) of CMIP3 and CMIP5, a clear interpretation is not available. With respect to the linear trend in the observed CIM (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>, right panels) CMIP3 simulations (blue) are nearly equally distributed about the zero line, while the CMIP5 simulations show clear positive bias. In general, more CMIP3 simulations are found within the acceptability bands, with the CMIP3 ensemble closer to the observed ensemble than the CMIP5 ensemble (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>). One of the possible sources of error (difference) in simulations is the model's ability to simulate various regional and large-scale climate processes. A large spread exists in both Indian and Australian average monsoon rainfall and their interannual variability in CMIP3 and CMIP5

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>). With respect to regional processes, both CMIP5 and CMIP3 simulations show stronger than observed LETG-IND index with comparable IOD index (
