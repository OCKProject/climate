<p class="p">The assessment of the simulated trends is made further complex by the fact that the observed trend itself has a degree of uncertainty; different observed data sets show appreciable differences among them (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). The differences in the basic statistical quantities like the mean and the standard deviation in different observations are quite high (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). To avoid any bias in the evaluation, we have considered six data sets from different sources (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Further, a multi-epochal analysis (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>) was carried out to examine variation in trends due to low-frequency variability for three separate epochs: 1951–2005, 1951–1975 and 1976–2005. We have also considered an ensemble formed through an equal-weight averaging for both observations and simulations. The epochal trends for 1951–2005 and 1976–2005 as % of standard deviation of the respective period are of the same signs (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>); this suggests that success in simulation of trend in an earlier epoch is indicative of skill for future projection. It is worth noting that all the seven observations show similar (negative) trends (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Although the trend for 1951–2005 in GPCP is negative but significant only at 86% level; all other trends are negative and significant at more than 90%. In what follows, unless otherwise mentioned, we shall consider the composite observation for evaluation of the simulations. For gaining insight, we consider three (equal-weight average) ensembles based on the levels of the statistical significance of the trends: High significance (Probability, P &lt; 0.01), Low significance (P &lt; 0.05) and all-average observations. For model simulations, such as trends and correlation coefficients, we shall adopt a value P &lt; 0.2 as the acceptable level of significance in view of inherent uncertainties in simulations. The trends for three epochs had been used to examine and establish the consistency of the analysis; however, only long-term (1951–2005) trends are used to evaluate the CIM simulations.
