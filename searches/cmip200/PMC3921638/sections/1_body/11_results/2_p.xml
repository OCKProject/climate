 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" class="xref">15</xref>. To ensure robustness of our results, we have considered five domains that encompass relatively small case of CIM as well as larger domain that also includes parts of Indian Ocean (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>). As expected, there are small differences among the seasonal mean rainfall and the trends for different domains even in observations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>); however, the values are generally consistent. We note that for D5 (continental India plus ocean) the trends are opposite for 1951–2005 and 1951–1975; however, this could be a manifestation of low-frequency variability. For our discussion, it is important to note that both CMIP3 and CMIP5 (all) ensemble reproduce the current (1976–2005) trends within the margin of acceptability (
