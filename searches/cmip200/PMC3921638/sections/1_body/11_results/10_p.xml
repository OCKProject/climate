<p class="p">It is important to note that all the simulations that satisfy the condition of significant negative trend in the historical simulation of CIM rainfall also possess LETG-IND index similar to that in the observation (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3" class="xref">Table 3</xref>); no such consistent signal is seen for the other two regional indices DTTD (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3" class="xref">Table 3</xref>) and IOD (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4b</xref>). Indeed all the simulations that satisfy some acceptability criteria also show LETG-IND index close to observation (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1" class="xref">Table S2</xref>), although some models are found with weaker acceptability criteria (2Î”) in terms of annual and seasonal mean rainfall. In terms of large-scale indices, all the seven simulations that satisfy the criteria in terms of seasonal and annual mean as well as significant negative trend in the historical simulation of CIM rainfall show significant (99% in five cases, 95% in two cases) ENSO index as observed, while no consistent signal emerges for the LETG-SA index (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). It appears that successful simultaneous simulation of some indices is necessary for reproducing accurate trend in the historical data and acceptable annual and seasonal mean; overall, the importance of the land-ocean contrast is consistent with earlier results
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36" class="xref">36</xref>. However, while these may provide necessary conditions, they are clearly not sufficient. An important feature is that there is no simulation that shows significant negative trend in seasonal rainfall without simulating the LETG-IND index and ENSO index similar to the observed values (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3" class="xref">Table 3</xref>).
