<p class="p">In the next step of hierarchical assessment, we have considered the simulations with significant (P &lt; 0.2) negative trends in CIM rainfall (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3a</xref>) that fall in an acceptable error band in the seasonal and annual rainfall (within the dispersion in the observations). While all the ensembles are within or near the box of acceptability (with the observed ensemble at the center by definition), only a few simulations from either CMIP3 or CMIP5 are within the box; many simulations show as much as 60% difference with the observed values (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3a</xref>), although, the ensemble average of CMIP5 is closer to the observed composite than the CMIP3 composite (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3a</xref>). In terms of the spread around the observed values, the CMIP5 models show wider spread than the CMIP3 simulations. As per our hierarchical evaluation, nine (E,F,H,J,K,
 <bold class="bold">L</bold>,P,R,
 <bold class="bold">U</bold>) CMIP5 simulations and eight (h,i,j,k,l,o,s,u) CMIP3 simulations satisfy weaker twin criteria 
 <bold class="bold">(a)</bold> and 
 <bold class="bold">(b)</bold> however, there are only two CMIP5 simulation (L, U) that satisfy the twin criteria of simulating the acceptable range of observed trend and the seasonal/annual rainfall over the period 1951â€“2005; there are two CMIP3 simulations (h, s) that satisfy these criteria. In what follows, we shall focus on seasonal (CIM) rainfall. The area-averaged seasonal rainfall from the selected CMIP5 and CMIP3 ensembles shows decreasing trend as observed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3b</xref>); however, CMIP5 indicates a weaker trend while CMIP3 produces a stronger trend. It is interesting to note that in terms of absolute error in trends, CMIP5 and CMIP3 are comparable.
