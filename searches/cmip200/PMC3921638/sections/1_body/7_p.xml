<p class="p">Historical precipitation records over the monsoon regions around the globe reveal a decreasing trend in the global land monsoon precipitation

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28" class="xref">28</xref> over the last half of the century (1948–2003), with primary contributions from a weakening of the summer monsoon systems in the Northern Hemisphere (NH). When the oceanic monsoon rainfall is combined with the land monsoon, the global monsoon precipitation is found to have increased for the 1979–2008 epoch, mainly due to an increase in the NH summer monsoon precipitation
