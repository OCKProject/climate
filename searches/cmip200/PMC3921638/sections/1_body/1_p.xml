<p class="p">An important issue in our approach is to assess climate projections based on the accuracy of trends for the current climate. Many climate-modelling groups around the world have participated in the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5). Under CMIP5, a series of simulations including the twentieth century historical simulation and the twenty-first century climate projections with four different representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios were performed
