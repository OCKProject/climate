  <p class="p">Multimodel ensemble mean change in flow duration curves for the near (2010–2039, green) and end (2070–2099, red) period for the RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5. Changes were estimated for each CMIP5-GCM with respect to the historic reference (1971–2000) period and then ensemble mean was estimated. The shaded region shows intermodel variation estimated using one standard deviation for the near (cyan) and end (pink) period. The figure was developed using the Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) version 5.4.2 (
