   <bold class="bold">(A)</bold> Comparison of observed storage reservoir storage (red) (BCM) with the VIC model simulated reservoir storage (black) with the observed meteorological forcing and multimodel ensemble mean storage (green) simulated using the VIC model using downscaled and bias-corrected forcing for 10 CMIP5-GCMs for the period of 2002–2014. 
   <bold class="bold">(B)</bold> Comparison of flow duration curves obtained using the VIC model simulated streamflow with observed data (black) and downscaled and bias-corrected data from the GCM models (green) for the historic period (1971–2000). Shaded regions show intermodel variability for the historic (green) periods. The figure was developed using the Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) version 5.4.2 (
