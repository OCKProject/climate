We selected the 10 GCMs (GFDL-CM3, GFDL-ESM2G, GFDL-ESM2M, MIROC5, MIROC-ESM, MIROC-ESM-CHEM, NorESM1-M, CCSM4, CESM1-CAM5, and HadGEM2-AO) out of about 40 CMIP5 models. The daily data from GCMs were bias corrected for the 1951–2099 period [historic: 1951–2005 and future: 2006–2099 periods] using the methodology of Hempel
