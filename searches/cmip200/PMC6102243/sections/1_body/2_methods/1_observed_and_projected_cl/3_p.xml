<p id="Par19" class="p">Streamflow and DHP analysis for the future climate were carried out using the VIC simulated streamflow for the near (2010–2039), mid (2040–2069), and end (2070–2099) periods. Projected changes in the future climate were estimated against the historical reference period of 1971–2000. Since our assessment for the projected future climate is based on bias-corrected data from the CMIP5-GCMs, we first evaluated the effectiveness of the bias-corrected data against the observations. We find that all-India averaged seasonal cycle of the bias-corrected GCMs precipitation and temperature were well compared with the observed precipitation and temperature for the historic reference period (1971–2000) (Fig.
