<p id="Par27" class="p">The monthly storage of the reservoir was calculated using the monthly inflow and release, which was compared with the observed reservoir storage to ensure that storage follows the rule curve of each reservoir. Since we used the no irrigation demands case of the Hanasaki

 </sup>, the storage for each reservoir was higher than that from the observed rule curve of the reservoir. To meet the other requirements (industrial, residential, and irrigation water demands), surplus storage was deducted (for the other water demands), and the rule curve was followed (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2A</xref>). The developed hydropower (HP, kW) potential of a reservoir was then estimated based on the monthly release: HP = min(R
 <sub class="sub">m</sub> × h × g, IHC). Hydraulic head (h) was assumed to be linearly related to the reservoir storage, h = S/A, where S is the mean reservoir storage during the estimation time step, and A is the reservoir area. Also, A = C/H, where H is the height of the dam, which is also the maximum of h.
