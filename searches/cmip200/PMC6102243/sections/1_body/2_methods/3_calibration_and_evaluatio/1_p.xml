<p id="Par22" class="p">The observed streamflow data were obtained from the India Water Resources Information System (WRIS) and the Global River discharge database-SAGE. Simulated monthly streamflow from the VIC model was compared with the observed monthly streamflow at the gage location to evaluate the ability of the model (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>). Monthly streamflow was calibrated at the gage stations that are located upstream of the reservoirs (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>). Therefore, these stations are not substantially affected by abstraction

 </sup> (NSE) and correlation coefficient (r) between observed and simulated streamflow were used to evaluate the performance of the model (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S7</xref>). All the four basins showed NSE greater than 0.7 and correlation coefficient (r) greater than 0.85 during the calibration periods (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S7</xref>). The performance of the VIC model was satisfactory for the evaluation periods as well (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S7</xref>). The performance of hydrologic models during the observed period can reduce the uncertainty in climate change impacts assessment
