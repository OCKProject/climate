 </sup> showed approximately ±5% change in mean global hydropower production by 2080 s. There are uncertainties in the projections of annual hydropower production. For instance, global theoretical hydropower potential (THP), the maximum hydropower production under the ideal condition without any losses, is projected to increase moderately due to climate change
