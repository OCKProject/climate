 </sup>. Despite the profound implications of climate change on streamflow, the linkage between climate change and hydropower production in India remains unexplored. Here, we provide the first-ever assessment of climate change impacts on hydropower potential of the seven large hydropower projects with more than 300â€‰MW installed capacity in India. These reservoirs are of the national importance, and most of them fall among the top 10 hydropower projects in India.
