<p id="Par5" class="p">We performed the analysis on seven (Nathpa Jhakri, Bhakra Nangal, Srisailam, Nagarjuna Sagar, Hirakud, Sardar Sarovar, and Indira Sagar) large hydropower projects in India (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>, and Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>). These large reservoirs are located in four major Indian sub-continental basins: Indus, Krishna, Mahanadi, and Narmada (Tables 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>). Nathpa Jhakri and Bhakra Nangal reservoirs are located on Satluj River, which flows from the snow dominated upper part of the Indus basin (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Satluj River has the third largest drainage area in Himalaya and elevation in Satluj river varies from 400 to 7200 m. About 66% of the drainage area of Satluj River falls in China, and the rest is in India. At higher elevations in Satluj basin, snowfall occurs during December to March while summer (July to September) is monsoon dominated. Mean annual precipitation is 1.2 and 1.4 mm/day while mean annual air temperature in Nathpa Jhakri and Bhakra Nangal is −0.08 and 1.3 °C, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Mean annual glacier contribution at Bhakra dam on Satluj River is about 4.8%

 </sup>. The other five reservoirs are located in the monsoon-dominated climate in central-south India (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>, Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>). Mean annual precipitation in the five reservoirs located in central-south India varies from 2.1 to 3.50 mm/day while mean annual air temperature ranges from 25.4 to 26.0 °C (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). The total installed capacity of Srisailam, Nathpa Jhakri, Sardar Sarovar, Bhakra Nangal, Indira Sagar, Nagarjuna Sagar, and Hirakud are 1670, 1500, 1450, 1325, 1000, 816, and 307.5 MW, respectively.
