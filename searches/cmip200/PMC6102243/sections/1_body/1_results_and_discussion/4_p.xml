 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>). We find that most of the catchments (except Nathpa Jhakri and Bhakra Nangal) upstream of these large reservoirs experienced a significant (p-value &lt; 0.05) warming and a non-significant (p-value &gt; 0.05) decline in mean annual precipitation during the observed period (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>). For all the reservoirs, mean annual streamflow has declined from 1951 to 2007 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>, Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>). Consistent with the findings of Palazzi

 </sup>, we find a significant (p-value &lt; 0.05) decline in mean annual precipitation and a moderate increase (p-value &gt; 0.05) in mean annual temperature resulted in significant (p-value &lt; 0.05) reduction in streamflow at Nathpa Jhakri and Bhakra Nangal reservoirs (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>). Other five reservoirs show a moderate but not significant decline in mean annual streamflow during the period 1951–2007 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>, Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>). Overall, we find that all the large hydropower projects experienced a dry and warm climate that resulted in a decline in mean annual streamflow during the period of 1951–2007.
