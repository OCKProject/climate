 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). The VIC simulated snow cover captures observed monthly and seasonal variability (in MODIS based snow cover) reasonably well during the 2004–2007, however, underestimates the snow-covered area (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). For instance, the average snow-covered area from the VIC simulations and MODIS are 26.1% and 32.9%, respectively for 2004–2007. We attribute this underestimation of the snow covered area to the quality of meteorological forcing. The density of gage stations in the Himalayan region is less, which can cause uncertainty in observations of temperature and precipitation

Overall, the performance of the VIC model to simulate streamflow, snow cover, reservoir storage, and flow duration curves provides a basis for the assessment of DHP under the projected future climate for these major reservoirs.
