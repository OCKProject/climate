<p id="Par15" class="p">We find that the two reservoirs (Nathpa Jhakri and Bhakra Nangal) located in Northern India are projected to become precipitation dominated under the future climate. Changes in snow storage result in a projected decline in streamflow and DHP in May-June when most of the streamflow comes from snowmelt. Nathpa Jhakri and Bhakra Nangal reservoirs are projected to experience much higher warming (more than 6.25 °C) in comparison to the other reservoirs located in the monsoon-dominated climate. Significant warming results in a decline in snow storage, causing a reduction in streamflow in May-June, which is consistent with the findings of the previous studies

 </sup>. The reservoirs located in central and southern India are projected to experience an increase in streamflow and DHP, which is mainly because of an increase in the monsoon season precipitation under the projected future climate
