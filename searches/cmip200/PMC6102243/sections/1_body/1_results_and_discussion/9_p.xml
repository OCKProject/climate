 </sup>, and projected warming plays a secondary role. We find that snow cover and snow depth is projected to decline under the projected future climate in the catchment of Nathpa Jhakri and Bhakra Nangal (Figs 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S7</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S8</xref>). The projected decline in snow depth and snow cover will result in reduced snow water equivalent and early snowmelt (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). Moreover, snowfall is projected to reduce substantially during the winter season by the end of the 21

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S9</xref>) while rainfall is projected to increase during the monsoon season (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S10</xref>). The projected decline in snowfall and snowmelt is consistent with the changes during the observed period. Bhutiyani

 </sup> reported that in Satluj River basin, the contribution of glacier and snowmelt has declined during 1922–2004. A comparison between snow and rain suggests a more substantial increase in the monsoon season rainfall in contrast to the reduction in the amount of snow, which results in an overall increase in streamflow in the basin (Table
