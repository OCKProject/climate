 </sup> by comparing the observed and the VIC model simulated seasonal variation in reservoir storage (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2A</xref>). The VIC model was calibrated and evaluated for monthly streamflow (see methods for details). The VIC model simulated reservoir storage compares well against the observed reservoir storage. The VIC simulated reservoir storage for the historic (1971–2000) period from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5)-GCMs is in a good agreement with the observed storage, which indicates the effectiveness of the bias-correction method (Fig.
