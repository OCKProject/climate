<p id="Par14" class="p">Finally, we estimated DHP using the VIC model simulated streamflow and other parameters for the reservoirs (see methods for details). DHP projections are in general similar to streamflow projections showing a projected increase under warming climate (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). However, DHP is projected to decline in May-June for Bhakra Nangal and Nathpa Jhakri reservoirs mainly due to the projected decline in streamflow in summer (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S5</xref>). This projected decline in streamflow during May-June can be attributed to a decrease in snow water equivalent and snowmelt in May-June under warming climate (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). Multimodel ensemble mean projected changes in DHP are 0.68 ± 6.4%, 0.22 ± 6.90%, 2.41 ± 4.64%, 3.90 ± 6.62%, 0.42 ± 4.00%, 0.99 ± 5.86%, and 2.87 ± 12.45% for Nathpa Jhakri, Bhakra Nangal, Srisailam, Nagarjuna Sagar, Hirakud, Sardar Sarovar, and Indira Sagar, respectively in the near term under RCP 2.6 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S11</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S5</xref>). Under RCP 8.5, DHP is projected to increase for all the reservoirs and throughout the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S11</xref>, and Table
