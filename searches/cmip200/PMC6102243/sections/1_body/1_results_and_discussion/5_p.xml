<p id="Par9" class="p">Year-to-year variability, estimated using the coefficient of variation (CV) of streamflow, ranges between 0.30 and 0.65 for all the reservoirs with higher values for Srisailam and Nagarjuna Sagar (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3a</xref>). We analyzed composite anomalies of streamflow (%) for the top five dry, and wet years from 1951 to 2007 (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref>). Streamflow during the monsoon season for the five driest years (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref>) on the record (1951–2007) shows a significant deficit (more than 40%) indicating that prolonged droughts have a significant influence on streamflow and hydropower production (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3b</xref>). Similarly, during the top five wet years (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref>), the monsoon season streamflow was higher than 60% of its long-term mean for most of the reservoirs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3c</xref>). Our results highlight the potential role of observed climate variability and climate extremes (dry and wet years) on streamflow and hydropower production.
