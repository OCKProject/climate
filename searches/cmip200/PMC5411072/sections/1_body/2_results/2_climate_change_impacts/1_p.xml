<p class="p">The PDFs and CDFs of the simulated yield changes are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0176766.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>. All PDFs of yield changes shift more negatively, and the negative tail widens from SJZ to YY. In general, the mean projected decreases in maize yield ranged from 7% at SJZ to 18% at YY. The highest probability at all sites is a yield change in the –20% to 0% interval. However, the probabilities of yield change in the –40% to –20% and –20% to 0% intervals are approximately the same at YY and ZK. All CDFs showed that the probability of maize yield decrease was more than 70%.
