 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0176766.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>. Interestingly, the results suggest increased grain weight but a significant decrease in grain number during grain development. The projection for grain weight increased by 5% (SJZ) ~ 11% (YY), with the probability of 73% (SJZ) ~ 86% (DZ) in the period 2010–2039. The reduction of grain number was large, with the percentages relative to the historical value of 11% (SJZ) ~ 20% (YY). The CDFs point to a probable decrease in maize grain number, ranging from 83% at SJZ to 94% at ZK in the period 2010–2039. Therefore, the large decreases in maize yield were related to the decreases in grain number caused by supra-optimal temperatures around flowering.
