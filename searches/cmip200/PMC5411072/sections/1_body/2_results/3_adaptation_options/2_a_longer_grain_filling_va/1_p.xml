<p class="p">The results of using a synthetic variety with an enhanced grain-filling period are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0176766.g006" class="xref">Fig 6</xref>. The peak of the PDFs indicated that the variety had beneficial impacts on yield increases, which ranged from 7% at SJZ to 10% at YY. Compared with 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0176766.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>, yield change with intervals of –60% ~ –40% were absent. The CDFs suggested that maize yield would increase, with a probability of 66% (DZ) ~ 78% (ZK).
