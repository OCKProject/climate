 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0176766.g005" class="xref">Fig 5</xref>. The mean of the PDFs shift more to the positive side, indicating the relatively large possibility of yield increases. Comparing the PDFs, we can see that the dispersions of yield changes were relatively stable. The maize yield would be increased by 6% (DZ) ~ 10% (ZZ), with an S.D. range of 12% (DZ) ~ 17% (ZZ). The yield change in the 0% to 20% interval has the maximum probability at all stations. The CDFs showed that the maize yield would increase with a probability of 65% (YY) ~ 73% (DZ).
