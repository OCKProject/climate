 <italic class="italic">Xundan29</italic> based on the different study sites. The simulated dates of flowering and maturity were close to the observed values. Grain yield was reasonably well predicted. Overall, more than 70% of the variation in the measured phenology and grain yield was explained by the model. The RMSE of simulated flowering and maturity dates was 1 and 2 days, respectively, with average error of 3% for the flowering date and 2% for the maturity date. The RMSE of simulated maize yields was 0.6â€“0.8 t ha
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>, with errors generally less than 10%.
