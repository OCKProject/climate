<p class="p">Outputs from 8 GCMs under the RCP4.5 scenario archived by CMIP5 were used in the present study: BCC-CSM1-1 (China), CCSM4 (USA), CSIRO-MK3-6-0 (Australia), EC-EARTH (Europe), GFDL-ESM2G (USA), IPSL-CM5A-MR (France), MRI-CGCM3 (Japan), and NorESM1-M (Norway). Detailed information on forcing data can be found on the CMIP5 website (
