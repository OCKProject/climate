 <xref rid="pone.0176766.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> summarizes the increases of maximum and minimum temperature during 2010–2039, with reference to the maize-growing season (June-September) during 1976–2005. The mean maximum temperature generally increased from 0.4°C to 1.2°C under RCP4.5 during the period 2010–2039 at all sites relative to 1976–2005. The increases in mean minimum temperature were greater under the future scenarios than those of the mean maximum temperature at all sites, which were 0.7–1.4°C under RCP4.5.
