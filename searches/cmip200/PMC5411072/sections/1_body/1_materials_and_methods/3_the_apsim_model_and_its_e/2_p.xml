<p class="p">Prior to its use, using a trial-and-error method, APSIM-Maize was calibrated based on measured flowering, maturity and maize yield at all sites in 2008 to determine the parameters for the variety 
 <italic class="italic">Xundan29</italic>. The parameters included thermal time required from emergence to end of the juvenile stage (143째Cd), thermal time required from flowering to maturity (850째Cd), photoperiod slope (18째Ch
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>), potential grain numbers per head (600), grain-filling rate (11 mg of grain per day), and maximum temperature above which grain number is reduced (36째C). The calibrated model was then evaluated using experimental data from 2009. The coefficient of determination (
