<p class="p">All the simulations were run by the APSIM model and the outputs of 8 GCMs for climate change period 2010–2039 and compared with the corresponding simulation under baseline climate conditions (1976–2005). To provide an ensemble effect of climate change on maize yield changes under 8 GCMs, probability density functions (PDFs) and cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) were used to describe their probability distributions.</p>
