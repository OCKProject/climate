<p class="p">The other synthetic maize variety, with an enhanced grain-filling period, was represented by enhancing the coefficient of thermal time required from flowering to maturity used by the model. For the variety 
 <italic class="italic">Xundan29</italic>, the coefficient of thermal time required from flowering to maturity is 850°Cd. To simulate the possible effect of the required thermal time, we assumed that this value would be increased to 950°Cd.
