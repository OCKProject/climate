<p class="p">One simple genotypic adaptation to the future climate explored in the study can be obtained through enhanced thermal time requirements during the grain-filling period, mimicking later maturing varieties. It should be noted that in this study, the benefit to maize of using later-maturing varieties did not consider wheat production in the wheat-maize cropping system in the NCP. Actually, “Double-Delay” technology considers the yield advantages of the whole cropping system, rather than individual crops, and attributed a significant benefit to maize and a yield reduction in wheat [
 <xref rid="pone.0176766.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Therefore, without considering corresponding measures for wheat, the increase in yield of maize by using later-maturing varieties might not offset the yield loss of wheat in future climate change scenarios.
