<p class="p">Several important issues could not be addressed in our study. For instance, a single crop model was used for the investigations, which would be plagued with uncertainty [

 <xref rid="pone.0176766.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>], although the APSIM has proven reliable in the studies. To enhance a more general understanding on assessments of climate change impacts, crop models based on different structures or physiological processes should be included in further work. The use of multiple emission scenarios should also be investigated to cope with uncertainty in simulating crop yield.
