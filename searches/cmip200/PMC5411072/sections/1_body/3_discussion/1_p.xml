<p class="p">In the present study, we assessed the impacts of climate change on maize yield and yield components in NCP while accounting for climate uncertainty. Like many previous studies [

 <xref rid="pone.0176766.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>], a decline in maize yield was found in our study. Furthermore, a large decrease in grain number relative to the stabilized grain weight decreased maize yield under the future climate scenarios in our study. Maize grain number is very sensitive to environmental stresses, such as high temperature around flowering, and strongly associated with final yield [
