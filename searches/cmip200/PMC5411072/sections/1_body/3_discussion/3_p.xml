<p class="p">The other genotypic adaptation to increased heat stress can be obtained through improved tolerance of crop pollen viability, e.g., formation of the grain number, to high temperature. Although this study carried out a rough analysis by increasing the threshold for identifying the occurrence of heat stress on grain number from 36 to 37°C, a modelling approach might prove a useful tool to evaluate ex-ante innovative combinations of genes and their interest for future climates to guide breeding approaches [

 <xref rid="pone.0176766.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>] showed that using a rice variety with a temperature tolerance threshold for spikelet fertility of 38.5°C rather than 36.5°C could be an effective adaptation strategy in India. Extreme heat is likely to become more frequent with climate warming, and the negative impact of heat stress during the reproductive period has been identified as a major threat to yield in many parts of world [
