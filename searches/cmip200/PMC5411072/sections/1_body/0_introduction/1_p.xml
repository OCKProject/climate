Efforts to identify suitable varieties with the characteristics of increasing crop yield would be important to the development of sustainable agriculture for a future climate. Furthermore, projections of future climate change are inherently uncertain, given the different characteristics of GCMs, and this must also be considered when evaluating climate change impacts [
