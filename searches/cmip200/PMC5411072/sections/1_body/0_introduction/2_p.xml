<p class="p">The North China Plain (NCP) is the largest summer maize production area in China (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0176766.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>). Maize experiences a hot summer growing season and heat stress, particularly during reproduction, which could dramatically decrease yields in the NCP [

 <xref rid="pone.0176766.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. Much experimental evidence has demonstrated the relationship between high temperatures in the period centered on flowering and reduced grain number, with significant negative impacts on grain yield [

 <xref rid="pone.0176766.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. However, the adoption of varieties with improved high-temperature tolerance of pollen viability, e.g., formation of grain number, which is the determining factor in maize yield [
 <xref rid="pone.0176766.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>], has occurred much more slowly. Furthermore, “Double-Delay” technology on wheat-maize cropping systems in the NCP has been proven to be a valid planned adaptation strategy to climate warming in recent years [

 <xref rid="pone.0176766.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. The delayed sowing of wheat allows a longer duration of maize growth (longer grain filling period) or accommodation of later-maturing maize varieties. Improved understand of whether using a later-maturing maize variety could contribute to an increase in crop yield is essential to the development of an adaptation strategy against future climate warming.
