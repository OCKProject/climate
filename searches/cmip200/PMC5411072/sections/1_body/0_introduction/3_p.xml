<p class="p">In this context, we use synthetic maize varieties characterized by improved high-temperature tolerance of grain number formation and enhanced thermal time requirements during the grain-filling period in the APSIM model to investigate the potential impact of genotypic adaptation to future climate scenarios. To account for the uncertainty of climate projections, the APSIM model was linked with the outputs of 8 GCMs under the RCP4.5 scenarios.</p>
