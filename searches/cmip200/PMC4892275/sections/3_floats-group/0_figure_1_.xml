  <p class="p">Observed and simulated time series of the anomalies in annual and global mean surface temperature. All anomalies are differences from the 1961 to 1990 time-mean of each individual time series. The reference period 1961–1990 is indicated by yellow shading; vertical dashed grey lines represent times of major volcanic eruptions. (
   <italic class="italic">a</italic>) Single simulations for CMIP5 models (thin lines); multi-model mean (thick red line); different observations (thick black lines). Inset: the global mean surface temperature for the reference period 1961–1990, for each individual model (colours), the CMIP5 multi-model mean (thick red), and the observations. (
   <italic class="italic">b</italic>) Single simulations from available EMIC simulations (thin lines). Observational data are the same as in (
   <italic class="italic">a</italic>). All EMIC simulations ended in 2005 and use the CMIP5 historical forcing scenario. Inset: Same as in (
   <italic class="italic">a</italic>) but for the EMICs (adapted from Flato
