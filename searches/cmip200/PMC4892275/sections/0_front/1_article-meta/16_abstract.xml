 <p class="p">Given their increasing relevance for society, I suggest that the climate science community itself does not treat the development of error-free 
  <italic class="italic">ab initio</italic> models of the climate system with sufficient urgency. With increasing levels of difficulty, I discuss a number of proposals for speeding up such development. Firstly, I believe that climate science should make better use of the pool of post-PhD talent in mathematics and physics, for developing next-generation climate models. Secondly, I believe there is more scope for the development of modelling systems which link weather and climate prediction more seamlessly. Finally, here in Europe, I call for a new European Programme on Extreme Computing and Climate to advance our ability to simulate climate extremes, and understand the drivers of such extremes. A key goal for such a programme is the development of a 1â€‰km global climate system model to run on the first exascale supercomputers in the early 2020s.
