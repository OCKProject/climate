<p class="p">The most important resource needed to move climate science forward in the twenty-first century is human talent. Developing reliable climate models is not a matter of following some recipe book, it is about finding efficient ways of approximating an (effectively) infinite-dimensional nonlinear system to give approximate but reliable estimates of the future. This process requires imaginative and highly numerate scientists. The urgent need for such talent was brought to light in a recent News article in Nature, entitled ‘Climatologists to physicists: your planet needs you’ [
 <xref rid="RSPA20150772C11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. The article raised the question: How to spark enthusiasm for the field of climate science in budding researchers who might otherwise choose, say, astrophysics or cosmology for their focus of research. The article finished with a quote from a fluid-dynamics researcher from the University of Cambridge: ‘Most physics students would rather study with someone like Stephen Hawking, who is a member of our faculty’.
