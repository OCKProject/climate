<p class="p">Instead, I believe climate science should be targeting this substantial pool of post-PhD talent. In my experience, such talented scientists are as likely to be challenged by some of the formidable mathematical software engineering problems facing the development of ultra-high resolution climate models, as they might be in doing diagnostic analysis on climate data. That is to say, suitably trained, such talent may well be able to fill some of the current shortages that many climate centres have in software engineering. However, in order for these people to be competitive in the climate science job market, they need to spend a year or two learning the basics of climate and computer science. Because they are bright (you have to be very bright indeed to complete a PhD in number theory), they will pick up these basics extremely quickly and will be able to return investment in such retraining in no time at all.</p>
