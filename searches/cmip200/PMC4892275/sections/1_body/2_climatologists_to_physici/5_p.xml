<p class="p">I was lucky that at the time the Meteorological Office had a policy of taking on new graduates without any requirement for a background in weather or climate science. After a period at the Meteorological Office and a much longer period at the European Centre for medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), I am now back in academia. And back in academia, I have begun to realize that there is a considerable pool of PhDs and postdocs, not only in astrophysics and cosmology, but also in high-energy physics, number theory, quantum foundations and other ‘abstruse’ areas of science, who, having achieved their childhood ambitions of doing research in fundamental physics and mathematics, are keen to turn their skills to climate science. They want to save the planet and ask me: How can I make the change to your field?</p>
