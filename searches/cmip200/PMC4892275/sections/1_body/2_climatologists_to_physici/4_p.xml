<p class="p">What changed? In part, there was a nagging feeling, which increased with time, that I was not helping society in the slightest by spending large fractions of each day of the week working on abstruse problems that were not only irrelevant to society, but largely unexplainable to the person on the street. Also, I had a growing feeling that the major challenge facing my subject, formulating a theory of quantum gravity, was not going to be solved in the near future (and especially by me). And there was a realization that the mathematics and physics I was learning was relevant in other fields. For example, as part of my PhD work I had begun to study the Principle of Maximum Entropy Production as a technique to understand Hawking Evaporation: the quantum process whereby black holes radiate energy to the outside world. The epiphany which led me into the field of climate science was when geophysicist Raymond Hide, whom I had met by chance during the last year of my PhD, told me of recent work by climatologist Paltridge [
