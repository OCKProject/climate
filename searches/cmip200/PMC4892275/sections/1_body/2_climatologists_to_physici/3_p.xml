<p class="p">This topic resonates with me because my own PhD was in general relativity theory. My desire to do a PhD in this field was already formed at school, and by the time I was an undergraduate I was completely obsessed with the subject. I cannot imagine anyone being able to deflect me into the field of climate science at that stage of my career. And yet 3 years after my undergraduate degree I was so deflected.</p>
