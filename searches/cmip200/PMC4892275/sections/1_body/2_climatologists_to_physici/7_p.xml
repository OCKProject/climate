<p class="p">So, while agreeing wholeheartedly that climate science needs more mathematicians and physicists, I do not think it is realistic to imagine we can somehow persuade our brightest young scientists not to pursue their dream of quantizing gravity or proving (or disproving) the Riemann Hypothesis, just for the sake of the planet. Indeed I would not even want to try to dissuade them. Like finding the Higgs boson or gravitational waves, I believe strongly that these are important goals for humankindâ€”though less urgent than understanding climate change.</p>
