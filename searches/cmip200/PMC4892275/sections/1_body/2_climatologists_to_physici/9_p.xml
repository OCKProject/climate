<p class="p">In these days, where we are all living longer, and where the rules about retirement are being torn up, it makes no sense to take the view that we are largely typecast for the rest of our research lives by the research we do for our PhDs. So, in concluding this section, I call on the National Meteorological Services, the Research Councils (national and international) and the National Academies to jointly fund such retraining schemesâ€”open to PhDs in the fields of physics and mathematics, who wish to refocus their efforts to improve our understanding of the climate system. The cost/benefit ratio is surely minimally small.</p>
