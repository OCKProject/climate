<p class="p">However, probe below the surface and it can be seen that thinking about weather and climate forecasting as essential separate activities is not as scientifically meaningful as it might seem. Indeed, I would claim that trying to think about them as separate activities is actually hindering the development of climate science. Not least, weather prediction provides clear-cut metrics of model performance and it should therefore be used in the plethora of techniques needed to help develop a model which can pass the climate Turing test. Below I give two illustrations of this.</p>
