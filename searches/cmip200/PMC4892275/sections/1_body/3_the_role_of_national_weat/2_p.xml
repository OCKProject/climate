<p class="p">In parallel with activities on multi-decadal and centennial climate prediction, the National Meteorological Services (and international institutes such as the ECMWF cf. §5) provide society with forecast products on much shorter timescales—typically from hours to a season or two ahead. What distinguishes such ‘weather forecasts’ from the longer timescale ‘climate projections’? Weather forecasts are essentially initial-value problems: given a sufficiently accurate estimate of the state of the (ocean/atmosphere/land surface) climate system at some initial time

 <sub class="sub">1</sub>. By contrast, climate projections do not depend strongly on the initial state: here one attempts to estimate how the statistics of weather—essentially the geometry of the climate attractor in state space—are affected by some assumed level of carbon emissions into the atmosphere.
