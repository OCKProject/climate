<p class="p">An ability to estimate regional climate change will also be impacted if the climate model cannot simulate such blocking events well. This is relevant for a number of climate-related studies. For example, if the number of long-lived blocking anticyclones were to increase as CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentrations rise, then the number of winter days when demand for electricity is high, yet the wind is not blowing (nor the sun shining due to the pervasive low-level stratus that often accompanies winter blocks), then the chances of (non-nuclear) renewables alone providing sufficient power supply will be called into question. Also, if the number of blocking anticyclones increases, then it may be necessary to increase reservoir capacity as demand for water will not be easily met by rainfall from cyclonic weather systems. Finally, since droughts and heat waves tend to be associated with long-lived summertime blocks, a model which cannot simulate long-lived blocking well cannot be used to determine the extent to which a particular long-lived drought/heat-wave event can be attributed to anthropogenic climate change.
