<p class="p">The word ‘reliability’ needs to be unpacked. These days, weather forecasts are based on ensembles of integrations, made by varying the initial conditions and model equations consistent with uncertainty in these elements [
 <xref rid="RSPA20150772C18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. An ensemble forecast provides probabilistic predictions of weather events which either occur or do not occur in reality. For example, in the coming season, the seasonal-mean temperature for London will either be above or below average (relative to some suitably defined average). A seasonal forecast may predict that the probability of above-average temperature for London is 65%. What does it mean to say that this is a reliable prediction? If we take a subsample of all the seasonal forecasts where the probability of above-average temperatures lies say in the range 60–70%, then we would expect the observed frequency of occurrence of above-average temperature for this subsample of forecasts to also lie in the range 60–70%. Generalizing this condition to apply to all probability ranges defines a reliable forecast system. Note that reliability is not the same as skill. An unskilful but reliable ensemble forecast should always predict climatological probabilities.
