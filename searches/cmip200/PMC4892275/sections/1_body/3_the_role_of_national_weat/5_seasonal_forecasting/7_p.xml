<p class="p">As such, in a seamless forecast system, where essentially the same model is used in seasonal and longer timescale climate prediction, a measure of the unreliability of seasonal forecasts provides useful (yet incomplete) information to assess the reliability of longer timescale climate forecasts. From the perspective of a climate-change institute, this seasonal forecast information can be obtained ‘cost free’. In particular, a necessary (but not sufficient) condition that longer timescale probabilistic climate forecasts are reliable is that probabilistic seasonal forecasts made with the same model should be reliable. As such, the empirical correction used to make a probabilistic seasonal forecast system more reliable, can also be used to make regional probabilistic climate-change projections more reliable, particularly for quantities like precipitation [
