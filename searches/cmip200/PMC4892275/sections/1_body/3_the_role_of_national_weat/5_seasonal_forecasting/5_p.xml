<p class="p">In an unreliable forecast system, the forecast probability of an event will not be well calibrated against the observed frequency of the event. For example, a model may be overconfident in the likelihood of warm winter temperatures simply, because it is unable to simulate long-lived blocks. An empirical calibration of the forecast probabilities can partially take account of these model errors and make the forecast probabilities somewhat more reliable. However, no quasi-linear empirical calibration scheme can do an entirely satisfactory job, simply because one is dealing with a highly nonlinear system.</p>
