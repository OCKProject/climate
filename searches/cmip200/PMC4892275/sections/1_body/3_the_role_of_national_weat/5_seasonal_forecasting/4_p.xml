<p class="p">Because models have sizeable systematic errors on seasonal timescales, seasonal forecasts can themselves be unreliable [
 <xref rid="RSPA20150772C19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. For example, warmer than average summer temperatures, and colder than average winter temperatures in London are often associated with the occurrence of long-lived blocking anticyclones. However, the climatology of contemporary climate models often shows a deficiency in the simulated frequency of blocking anticyclones over Europe [
