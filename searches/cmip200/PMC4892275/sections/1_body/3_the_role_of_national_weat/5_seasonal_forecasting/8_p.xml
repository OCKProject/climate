<p class="p">However, the argument for joining together seasonal and long-term climate forecasting is more than it helps in assessing the reliability of climate projections. The primary bottleneck progressing climate science is lack of (human and computational) resources needed to improve our models. There is so much synergy between the seasonal and longer climate timescale in terms of basic circulation dynamics that the more scientists from these two areas can work closely together, the more the effective resource brought to the table. Research that reduces climate systematic errors on the seasonal timescale—for example, through the use of high-resolution ocean models—is of immediate relevance to the longer climate timescale.</p>
