<p class="p">I want to conclude this section with a very specific recommendation. One of the leading multi-model seasonal forecast systems in the world is the EUROSIP system comprising models from ECMWF, the Met Office, Météo-France and the US National Weather Service (information available from the ECMWF web site). This multi-model forecast system arose out of an EU Framework Programme research project (DEMETER) on seasonal climate prediction. The DEMETER project [
 <xref rid="RSPA20150772C23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>] demonstrated the advantage of a multi-model ensemble system over any one model system. In the near term, I would advocate the development of the EUROSIP system to provide information about regional climate change, for climate adaptation on multi-decadal timescales. To deny society the value of such a system because EUROSIP is designed primarily so solve an initial-value problem, and not a forced climate-change problem, would in my view be short-sighted.
