<p class="p">The contemporaneous observations will lead to a change in the estimated state of the climate system over that based on older observations and propagated forward in time by the model. This change is referred to as the ‘analysis increment’. One hopes that these analysis increments are not biased in any particular way. However, if the model’s representation of physical processes is erroneous, then the analysis increments will be biased relative to observations. Over the relatively short timescales over which observational information is propagated forward relative to observations in a data assimilation system (typically 6 h), biases in one locality will not have had significant time to propagate to a different locality. Hence studying model errors using a data assimilation system provides a powerful way to isolate errors to specific physical processes. In particular then, by focusing on the development of model error over short timescales, one can minimize the problem of compensation of errors, which, as discussed above, bedevils the diagnosis of model output on longer climate timescales. This technique was introduced by Klinker &amp; Sardeshmukh [
