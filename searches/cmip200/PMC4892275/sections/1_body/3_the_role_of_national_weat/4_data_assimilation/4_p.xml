<p class="p">Of course, there are many processes in the climate system that will act on timescales that are much too slow to be diagnosable in data assimilation mode. However, as discussed above, the crucial feedbacks that will determine whether anthropogenic climate change is going to be calamitous or not are associated with clouds, and cloud processes captured by the analysis increment diagnostic. As an example, Rodwell &amp; Palmer [
 <xref rid="RSPA20150772C16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>] showed that certain convective cloud parametrizations whose use in climate models gave rise to particularly large climate sensitivities could be ruled out, because the fit of the analysis increments to contemporaneous observations was particularly poor in regions of strong convection.
