<p class="p">In order to make accurate estimates of the initial state of the climate system, one clearly needs good quality observations. However, observations are neither of perfect quality, nor, at any particular time, do they cover all parts of the globe. For example, the ability to infer vertical temperature profiles in the atmosphere from satellite-sensed outgoing infrared radiances is strongly compromised by cloud cover. Hence, the best estimates of some initial state combine information from contemporaneous observations with those from earlier times, propagated forward using the equations of motion, i.e. using the weather forecast model. The general framework which allows this is known as data assimilation [
