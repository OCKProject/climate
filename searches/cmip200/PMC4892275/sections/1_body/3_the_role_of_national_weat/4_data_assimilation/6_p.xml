<p class="p">In practice, this means that climate institutes should be working closely with weather prediction centres, so that the models are closely linked to one another. In this way, information about biases in analysis increments can be used to inform developments in climate model development—especially when the latter can be performed at higher resolution than is possible now. This process of unifying weather and climate prediction systems is generally referred to as ‘seamless’ or unified prediction [
