<p class="p">Properly used, data assimilation can be a vital tool for understanding the sources of model error, and hence for improving models. It therefore is essential, in my view, for climate institutes to have an integrated data assimilation system in order to be able to make use of this technique for improving modelsâ€”and for improving representations of the hydrological cycle in particular. However, this is not straightforward: given the many different sources of observational data, both 
 <italic class="italic">in situ</italic>and remotely sensed, data assimilation code is immensely complex and running the code occupies a significant fraction of the computer time needed to make a weather forecast.
