<p class="p">What may not be obvious from a casual look at 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSPA20150772F1" class="xref">figure 1</xref>
 <italic class="italic">a</italic>, is that the global mean temperature anomaly for a particular model and a particular year, is the difference between simulated temperature for that year and the 1961–1990 time-mean global mean temperature 
 <italic class="italic">for that particular model</italic>. What this means in practice, is that the time-mean systematic error for each model has been subtracted 
 <italic class="italic">a posteriori</italic> in the time series shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSPA20150772F1" class="xref">figure 1</xref>
 <italic class="italic">a</italic>. How large are these systematic errors compared with the observed 
 <italic class="italic">ca</italic> 0.75°C trend in twentieth century global mean temperature? This can be gauged by studying the inset on the right-hand side of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSPA20150772F1" class="xref">figure 1</xref>
 <italic class="italic">a</italic>. It shows the actual 1961–1990 mean temperature for all the individual models in °C. It can be seen that the range of estimates of 1961–1990 temperature is well over 2°C.
