<p class="p">It must be emphasized here that I am not in any way criticizing the scientists who do spend much of their time developing climate models. However, considering the number of scientist hours spend developing and evaluating the CMIP5 generation of models, either we do not have sufficient resources to make progress, or we do not make best use of the resources we do have. Personally, I feel the answer is actually both!</p>
