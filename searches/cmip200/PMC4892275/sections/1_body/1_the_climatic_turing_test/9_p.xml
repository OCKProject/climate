<p class="p">Given calamitous scenarios at one end of the spectrum of possibilities, and more benign scenarios at the other end, surely climate scientists should be doing everything that science and technology allows to try to reduce uncertainty about future climate. This uncertainty cannot be reduced to zero: there will be uncertainty due to natural variability and scenario uncertainty, and it is completely unrealistic to imagine that model uncertainty will ever be reduced to zero. Nevertheless, to date, development of comprehensive 
 <italic class="italic">ab initio</italic> climate models have not helped reduce uncertainties in global warmingâ€”the AR5 range is little different to that from estimates made in the 1970s with much simpler models. It seems unlikely that we will be able reduce uncertainty in projections of global warming while model systematic errors are as large as the signals we wish to simulate. Put another way, it seems to me that a necessary condition for substantially reducing uncertainty about future climate is to develop a climate model which passes the climatic Turing test, at least on timescales of a few decades from some observed starting condition.
