<p class="p">As is well known, the risk of dangerous climate change arises from feedbacks associated primarily with the hydrological cycle as CO

 <xref rid="RSPA20150772C5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. If cloud feedbacks in particular turn out to be strongly positive, then climate change could pose an essentially existential threat to large sections of society, unless they can migrate to cooler parts of the planet. (Given the potential for severe conflict arising from mass migration, this option also poses life-threatening risks.) By contrast, if cloud feedbacks turn out to be largely negative—for example, associated with mesoscale organization of convective cloud systems in a warming climate [
 <xref rid="RSPA20150772C6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]—then the urgency to decarbonize economies by mid-century is reduced, particularly in the developing world, and perhaps more resources can be given to the question of how, with population levels increasing around the world, communities can become more resilient to weather extremes (both natural and human induced).
