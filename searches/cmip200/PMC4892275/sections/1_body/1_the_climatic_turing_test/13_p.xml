  <p class="p">It is found that there is virtually no improvement in all these measures [of tropical circulation] from the CMIP3 ensemble to the CMIP5 ensemble models. â€¦. No progress can be identified in the sub-ensembles of five best models from CMIP3 to CMIP5 even though more models participated in CMIP5; the systematic errors of excessive precipitation and overestimated SST in southeastern Pacific are even worse in the CMIP5 models.</p>
