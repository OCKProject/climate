<p class="p">I think the climate community worldwide does not give enough priority to developing a model which passes the climatic Turing test. We make do with our imperfect models, typically subtracting out the systematic errors against observations when estimating the impact of climate change. Journal referees recognize that this is the best we can do given the current generation of models, and so scientific careers can flourish without having to address the more fundamental question: Why is it so easy to tell the difference between model output and the real world?</p>
