<p class="p">Some might disagree and argue instead that our models will improve steadily to the desired level by continuing with the 
 <italic class="italic">status quo</italic>where models are developed on an institutional basis, with incremental levels of funding. This might well be so, but what if these steady improvements occur on timescales so slow as to be irrelevant to the needs of the current and next generation? Will climate modelling science have failed in its duty to society?
