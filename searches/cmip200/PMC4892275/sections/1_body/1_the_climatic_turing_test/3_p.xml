The individual model simulations show some scatter among themselves, consistent with the fact that no two models in the CMIP5 multi-model ensemble are identical, and that some variation can be expected in any case by virtue of the chaotic nature of the climate system. By and large, the observations lie within the ensemble of simulations—though the observations lie near the bottom of the ensemble towards the end of the period, consistent with the CMIP5 models having difficulty simulating the strong tropical trade-wind regime associated with the so-called global warming ‘hiatus’.
