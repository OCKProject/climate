<p class="p">Of course, it is far from easy to simulate global mean temperature from first principles, depending as it does on cloud cover, and hence the hydrological cycle. (It is of course possible to tune a model to have the right surface temperature. Whether the fact that this has not happened is due to scrupulous honesty on the modellers’ part, or whether the models have been tuned to get some other aspect of the simulated climate correct, such as radiative balance, is a moot point.) In any case, the difficulty in simulating the hydrological cycle accurately becomes yet more apparent when comparing a simulated field like rainfall with observations. As noted above, CMIP5 models show substantial large-scale systematic errors in the tropics associated with an excessive equatorial Pacific cold tongue and the so-called ‘double Intertropical Convergence Zone’ [
