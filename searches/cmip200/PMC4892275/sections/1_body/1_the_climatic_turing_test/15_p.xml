<p class="p">These matters become even more important if we focus on the regional climate response to increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. A crucial aspect of such response is in climate extremes: for example, persistent circulation anomalies which can bring drought and extreme heat for some regions and seasons, and extreme flooding for other regions and seasons. This makes it clear that estimates of future climate change require us to understand the impact of atmospheric CO

 <xref rid="RSPA20150772C10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Systematic errors in the strength of troposphere/stratosphere gradients degrade our ability to represent persistent anomalies in jet streams, and systematic errors in tropical circulation fields degrades the teleconnections between the tropics and the extratropics. This makes it extremely difficult to diagnose accurately the real climate drivers of extreme climate anomalies.
