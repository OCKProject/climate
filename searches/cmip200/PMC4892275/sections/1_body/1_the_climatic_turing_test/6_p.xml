<p class="p">One could perhaps take the view that we should focus attention on those models whose global mean systematic temperature error is relatively small, and discount all others. However, all climate modellers know that to do this would be naive: the models with small systematic error in surface temperature have significant errors in other global fields at surface or higher levels in the atmosphere, implying that the occurrence of small surface temperature error can, and generally does, arise from a partial compensation of errors in the representation of the many physical processes operating in the climate system. This problem of compensation of errors is one of the factors that make climate model development so difficult, and I will return to it in ยง4.</p>
