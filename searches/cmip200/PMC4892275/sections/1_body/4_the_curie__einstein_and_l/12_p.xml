<p class="p">Whether all of this needs to be ‘new money’ can be debated, which in turn raises a key question. Research council funding (national and international) for projects is often predicated on having a clear ‘path to impact’. There is a tendency for this to favour projects where partnerships with impact communities are developed within the projects. By contrast, a project to develop a global cloud-resolved climate model may be unable to develop clear partnerships with impact communities for many years—in any case, exascale computing is unlikely to arrive until 2023 or thereabouts and so the fruits of a global cloud-resolved model would not be ready to harvest until then. Indeed, worse than this, insisting prematurely on partnerships with impact communities could be detrimental to such a project, because it would take resources away from the critical goal—the development of one or more climate system models that will be able to serve the impact community (and society more generally) better than any current climate model is able. I would hope that Research Councils will be able to contribute significantly to a strong international programme to develop global cloud-resolved climate models, recognizing that the path to impact would be something that could not happen in the early phases of the project—but in the long run would be almost completely self-apparent.</p>
