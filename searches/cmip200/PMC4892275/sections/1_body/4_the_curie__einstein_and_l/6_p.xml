<p class="p">Of course, if the nations of the world each had infinite resources, there would be nothing wrong with such a strategy. But we do not live in such a world. Indeed, as models get more and more complex—encompassing not only higher and higher resolution, but more and more of the Earth System, and in ensemble rather than deterministic mode—the human and computing resources needed to develop and run these models at the institute level is becoming more and more of a challenge. And these days, a credible climate model is not just a set of modules for the different components of the Earth System, it is a piece of code that attempts to run as efficiently as possible on the many hundreds of thousands of individual processors that comprise a modern supercomputer. Increasingly, climate modellers have to be aware of the hardware that their models run on. And ‘running’ the model is only half the story: writing the output and developing the tools that can efficiently analyse this output is becoming increasingly hard. Because of this, the need for pooling human and computing resources has never been stronger.</p>
