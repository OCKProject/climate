<p class="p">Such a programme will feed directly into the work of the national meteorological and oceanographic services, as they advise government about future climate. The programme will also allow climate scientists who strive for a greater understanding of the drivers of extreme climate, to pursue their science. For example, it will be important that any future cloud-resolved model can be configured in idealized Earth-like configurations (e.g. the so-called aqua-planet). The relationship with academics would be expected to mirror that happening in the high-energy physics community.</p>
