<p class="p">I also reject the idea that we necessarily need a large ensemble of quasi-independent models to generate credible estimates of forecast uncertainty. Crucially, I do not see a climate model as a deterministic piece of computer code. Yes, the equations of motion are deterministic, but this does not mean that computational representations of these equations should be deterministic. I have written about these extensively elsewhere (e.g. [
 <xref rid="RSPA20150772C27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]), and do not intend to spend much space repeating the arguments here. Suffice it to say, that if we close the computational equations with deterministic parametrization formulae, we are doing damage to the scaling symmetries that the underlying partial differential equations respect. It is better to think of these closure equations in terms of random draws from some underlying probability distribution functions, constrained by the grid-scale information. That is to say, a model with inherent stochasticity in its closure schemes is a better representation of the underlying equations than one where the parametrization is a deterministic bulk formula entirely slaved to the grid-scale flow and predicated on some putative—but often non-existent—large ensemble of sub-grid processes.
