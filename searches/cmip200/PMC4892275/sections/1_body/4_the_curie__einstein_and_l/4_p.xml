<p class="p">The publication of this letter did not directly lead to the founding of an international bureau of meteorology. However, 50 years later, such a bureau was established: the ECMWF [
 <xref rid="RSPA20150772C26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>] an international meteorological organization based in Reading UK, and funded by 34 member states. Almost since the first day it produced an operational forecast, ECMWF has been 
 <italic class="italic">the</italic> world leading organization for medium-range weather forecasts (out to about two weeks ahead). ECMWF provides a work environment that can attract some of the best scientists from around Europe, has a sense and singularity of purpose and has clear ways to measure success. These ingredients have made ECMWF the envy of meteorological services on other continents and is an outstanding example of what can be achieved if we pool human and computing resources. (Of course, the existence of ECMWF does not in any way reduce the need for national meteorological services, which disseminate ECMWF products nationally, provide and train staff for ECMWF, and add a higher level of detail from regional high-resolution meteorological models run locally, than is possible from the direct global model output.) This success has completely vindicated Curie, Einstein and Lorentzâ€™s vision for such an organization.
