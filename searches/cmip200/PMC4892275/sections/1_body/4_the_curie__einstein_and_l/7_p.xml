<p class="p">I am also not convinced by the argument that having multiple quasi-independent models is necessary to engender competition and hence progress. Having worked for many years at ECMWF, I do not believe that rivalry with other weather forecast centres was the primary reason why the ECMWF scientists strove to produce yet better models. Rather, they wanted to improve on the current ECMWF model. They knew what the shortcomings of the current model were, and they were motivated to produce a new version of the model where these shortcomings were reduced and where the forecast skill scores were improved. This is probably true elsewhere.</p>
