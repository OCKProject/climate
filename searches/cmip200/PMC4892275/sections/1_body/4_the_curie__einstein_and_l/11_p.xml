<p class="p">Of course, converging on a single ‘world model’, even if it were stochastic, is unrealistic. Maybe the nations of the world could group together according to their geographical location—thus reducing the number of climate models to roughly one per continent. However, this may be politically naive—some countries get on less well with their neighbours than with distant countries. Perhaps a better analogy is with the groupings by which that the world’s airlines organize themselves. The reason why a particular airline belongs to the One World alliance rather than the Star alliance may be arcane. However, the reasons notwithstanding, we can take advantage of these groupings when trying to make our travel plans as uncomplicated as possible. Similarly, the reasons why individual climate institutes make alliances with others are their own affairs, if such alliances lead to a rationalization of climate modelling. So how many such alliances do we need? I would say as many as possible, given sustained funding for each of around $100 million per year.</p>
