<p class="p">Stochastic parametrization has become a well-established technique in numerical weather prediction. The reasons are not so much theoretical—a respect of scaling symmetries and so on—but rather that without such stochasticity, ensemble weather forecast systems are generically underdispersive, especially in the tropics where the impact of sub-grid parametrization is large. Stochastic parametrization is not so well established in climate prediction—where researchers prefer to trust estimates of uncertainty produced by (e.g. CMIP) multi-model ensembles. The development of more seamless prediction systems, exploiting synergies between weather and climate prediction, may see stochastic parametrization techniques becoming more established in the climate arena. When this happens, I believe the case for large multi-climate model ensembles will be weakened considerably.</p>
