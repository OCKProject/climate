<p class="p">Stochastic parametrization provides an inbuilt representation of model uncertainty. Is a single model with stochastic parametrization better than a multi-model ensemble? This was studied by Weisheimer

 <xref rid="RSPA20150772C28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>] using monthly and seasonal timescale forecasts. Results overall favoured the single model with stochastic parametrization, though for surface temperature on the seasonal timescale, the multi-model ensemble still had the edge. New stochastic representations of unresolved processes in land surface and oceanic models may swing the pendulum in favour of stochastic parametrization in the coming years.
