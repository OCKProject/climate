<p class="p">And yet we have not achieved such international collaboration in the field of climate prediction. Why is this? Perhaps the most vocal argument is that having an ensemble of quasi-independent nationally developed climate models around the globe is a good thing: it engenders a sense of competition between different institutes and this competitive spirit ensures progress. Moreover, by not ‘putting all our eggs in one basket’ this ensemble of models provides robust estimates of uncertainty in our predictions—surely also a good thing. I do not accept these arguments for a number of reasons.</p>
