<p class="p">Of course, climate science is not static, and one expects these model errors to reduce as the models improve (through higher resolution and better sub-grid parametrizations). However, given the urgency of the climate-change issue, a key question is whether this is happening quickly enough. As discussed in ยง2, despite the vast number of scientist hours spent developing and testing climate models, the improvement in climate models over the last few years has been very modest (indeed, according to some accounts, non-existent). As a result, I myself am convinced that we need urgently to find ways of accelerating developments in the science of climate modelling.</p>
