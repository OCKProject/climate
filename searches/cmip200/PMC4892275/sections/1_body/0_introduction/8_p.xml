<p class="p">Much of the discussion in this paper is predicated on the notion that to first order we do know the equations we wish to solve—it is just that we do not yet have the resources to solve these equations with the accuracy that we would like, and from which society can benefit. Some may argue that this is very much a physicist’s perspective, and that the relevant equations for evolution of biological processes are far from known. I would actually agree with this. For this reason, my focus in this paper is on the importance of simulation and prediction on multi-decadal, rather than multi-century or longer timescales (where biological processes do dominate). Of course, this is not to imply that biological processes are unimportant on these shorter timescales. However, on these shorter timescales they are generally of secondary importance to those associated with the physical hydrological cycle.</p>
