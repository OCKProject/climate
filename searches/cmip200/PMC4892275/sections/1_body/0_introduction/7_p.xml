<p class="p">In §§3–5, I will suggest three courses of action that we, the science community, need to take. In §3, I draw attention to a largely untapped pool of mathematical talent that should be recruited into climate science. Modest investment by Research Councils could be transformative in realizing this talent. In §4, I will make the case for a much stronger synergy between weather and climate prediction. It may come as a surprise to an outsider that a strong synergy does not already exist. However, for a number of reasons, not necessarily scientific, the synergy is often not nearly as strong as it should be. Finally, in §5, I want to discuss the establishment of an international meteorological prediction institute; a concept which, it may astonish many readers to learn, Albert Einstein himself advocated back in the 1920s.</p>
