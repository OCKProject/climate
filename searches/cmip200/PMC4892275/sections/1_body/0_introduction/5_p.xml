<p class="p">In the view of their relevance in solving urgent real-world problems, it is a matter of concern that climate models continue to exhibit pervasive and systematic errors when compared with observations (see ยง2). These errors can be as large as the signals predicted to arise from anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Because the climate system is profoundly nonlinear, these errors cannot be simply scaled away, or reliably subtracted out
