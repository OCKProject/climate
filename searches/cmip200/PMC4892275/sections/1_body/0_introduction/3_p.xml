<p class="p">A key reason for choosing this topic is that I do not think we take this problem nearly seriously enough. By ‘we’ I do not mean society in general, or indeed the governments that fund research on climate science. Rather, I mean the climate science community. This may seem an extraordinary statement to make given the millions of scientist hours spent developing climate models, running them on large supercomputers, and writing up results in the peer-reviewed literature and for IPCC assessment reports (which themselves consume enormous amounts of time). I therefore need to explain what I mean by this assertion.</p>
