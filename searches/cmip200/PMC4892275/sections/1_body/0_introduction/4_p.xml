<p class="p">Earth’s climate is a nonlinear system 
 <italic class="italic">par excellence</italic>. Nowhere is this more manifest than in the dynamics and thermodynamics of the hydrological cycle. Comprehensive climate models represent our best attempt to simulate our changing climate. They do this by attempting to solve 
 <italic class="italic">ab initio</italic> the relevant nonlinear laws of physics. These models/simulators play an increasingly important role (i) in providing the science input to global policy on carbon emissions; (ii) in determining the types of infrastructure investments that will have to be made regionally to adapt to climate change; (iii) in assessing whether there is a safe ‘Plan B’ to cool the planet, based, for example, on spraying SO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> into the stratosphere (leading to a layer of sulfate aerosol there); (iv) in attributing observed extreme weather events to anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases and (v) in extending weather prediction into the seasonal and perhaps even decadal timescales, hence, for example, being able to anticipate specific long-term droughts.
