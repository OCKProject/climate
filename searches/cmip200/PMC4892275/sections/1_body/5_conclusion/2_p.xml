<p class="p">At the 2015 Paris Climate Conference, leaders from 194 countries of the world unanimously acknowledged the serious threat posed by anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases; surely, there can no longer be any serious doubt about the reality of this threat. Item 7c of Article 7 of the Paris Climate Agreement (Item 7c of Article 7) recommends: ‘Strengthening scientific knowledge on climate, including research, systematic observation of the climate system and early warning systems, in a manner that informs climate services and supports decision making’. I myself would put it more strongly: Climate science must now step up a gear to provide reliable estimates of the climate of the coming decades, including climate extremes, on both global and regional scales, which are as sharp as possible. But we cannot do this without a step change in our modelling capabilities, and my view is that this will not be achieved without a more collaborative approach to climate model development. However, climate scientists must first come together and decide, independent of the politics of international collaboration and the politics of climate change, whether the scientific case for a more collaborative approach to climate model development can be made. If the climate research community can speak with one voice—as it does, for example, in the IPCC assessment reports—then the job is half done.</p>
