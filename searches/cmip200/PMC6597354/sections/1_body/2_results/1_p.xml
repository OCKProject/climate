<p id="P20" class="p">The distribution of WHO European Region cities with respect to population and socioeconomic development (per capita GDP) is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>. Against the global distribution, European cities do not include the very largest cities ("mega-cities") but otherwise have a similar distribution to that of the global sample (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Fig. 2.A</xref>). Only Istanbul, Moscow, London and Saint Petersburg have city populations of 5 million or more inhabitants, excluding wider metropolitan areas. The sample includes ten cities with populations below 50 000.
