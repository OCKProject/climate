<p id="P28" class="p">Given the limited number of cities and uncertainties over consistency of data definitions, the results of regressions of PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> on city characteristics should be interpreted cautiously as indicative only of general patterns of association. However, in models with mutual adjustment for per capita income, city (metropolitan) population and the number of cities within 500 km, there was clear evidence that both per capita income and city size were determinants of air pollution levels, while the number of cities within 500 km was not. Using, for simplicity, linear terms for each variable (in models with the other variables fitted as natural cubic splines), the adjusted changes in PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> levels (Î¼g.m
 <sup class="sup">-3</sup>) were: -5.10 (95% CI: -7.89, -2.31) for each US$ 10 000 increase in per capita GDP, 1.20 (0.23, 2.16) for each million increase in population, and -0.36 (-0.98, 0.26) for each additional 100 cities within 500 km.
