 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Fig. 4.D</xref> illustrates the importance of these three determinants of air quality. For each city, the air pollution concentration,predicted from a regression model that takes account of each variable fitted as natural cubic splines, is joined by a vertical arrow to the observed level. Cities in which the observed level is greater than predicted are shown with upward pointing arrows, while those where the observed level is below predicted are shown by downward arrows. For example, London has broadly the level of air pollution expected for its income, size and the number of cities within 500 km, while Stockholm appears to perform better than expected. These differences between observed and predicted air pollution may reflect the relative importance of local sources of pollution. These comparisons should be interpreted with some caution, however, as they depend on many factors including the accuracy of the input variables, especially estimates of per capita income.
