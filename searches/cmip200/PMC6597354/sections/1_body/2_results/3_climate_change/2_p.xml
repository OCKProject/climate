<p id="P23" class="p">In global terms, the SHUE cities of the European Region have some of the highest predicted temperature increases for the hottest month, with the mean projection for most cities being in excess of 2 °C by mid-century. By 2100, in the cities of Arad, Bressanone, Bucharest, Kateríni, Lyon, Mezotúr, Montpellier, Simferopol, Sofia, Subotica, Vercelli and Zagreb, the temperature increase in average daily mean temperature for the hottest month exceeds 7 °C (data not shown). Although RCP8.5 is a "high-end" projection, the result sindicate a very substantial shift in the temperature distribution by 2100 that, without effective adaptation measures, would likely lead to frequent exposure to temperatures well beyond the upper limits of current distributions, resulting in a substantial burden on mortality/morbidity and limitations to physical activity(
