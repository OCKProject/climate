<p id="P33" class="p">More detailed analyses will be reported in subsequent workas the database is developed. However,even from the relatively limited analyses presented here, it is possible to infer that the WHO European Region is likely to face substantial threat from unabated climate change, with some of the highest potential temperature increases under RCP8.5 of any cities in the database. The levels of temperature increase for the hottest month, if realised, would be very damaging, underlining the need for action to put in place adaptation responses and to accelerate steps for radical reduction in greenhouse gasemissions. Analyses of temperatureâ€“mortality relationships published elsewhere (
 <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>) suggest that urban populations are partly adapted to the temperature distributions to which they are currently exposed, and hence large rises in temperature suggest the potential for very large population health impact, assuming no further adaptation. Most of the cities with the highest projected temperature increases are in the middle- to high-income part of the income distribution (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Fig. 3.B</xref>), which may be important for their capacity to adapt should mitigation efforts fail to limit temperature rises over this century. However, the magnitude of the potential threat emphasizes the urgency for mitigation action. While RCP8.5 may be considered unlikely following the Paris Agreement, there is still doubt about the extent to which the agreement will be implemented and we show the projections here for illustrative purposes.
