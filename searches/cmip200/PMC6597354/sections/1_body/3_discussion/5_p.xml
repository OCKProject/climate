<p id="P36" class="p">The key limitations of attempting to assemble and analyse city-level data relate to the quality of the data itself because of uncertainties overcompleteness and comparability between cities. There are also limitations on the availability of data. Some metrics can only be obtained from population surveys that are often unavailable. In general, there are reasonable data available for larger, developed cities that are often collected by city administrations, whereas smaller cities and those in less wealthy countries have less data. There is particular advantage, therefore, in attempting to source data from globally monitored and modelled datasets. We also note that the GeoNames dataset from which cities were selected provides global coverage of cities but areas in Western Europe may have greater coverage than Eurasia (
