<p id="P32" class="p">The SHUE project is a "proof of concept" study aimed at developing a resource for the analysis of a representative set of cities to support policy formulation on healthy and sustainable urban development. It draws on existing data resources and aims to integrate and analyse them in ways that help to examine questions of principle about strategies for urban development. The analyses presented here, derived from the database, should be interpreted as a "data-driven" and "hypothesis-generating" process rather than as "hypothesis-testing": the data on which they are based is generally not sufficiently detailed or of documented quality, using standardized definitions to permit definitive interpretations of cause-and-effect relationships. Nor should they be used to evaluate the performance of any individual city. Nonetheless, by examining broad patterns of association across multiple cities of varying sizes and incomes, insights may be obtained about the mechanisms involved and the challenges and opportunities for promoting improved urban environments and health.</p>
