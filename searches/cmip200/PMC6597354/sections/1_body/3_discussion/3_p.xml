<p id="P34" class="p">Climate change mitigation is likely also to have beneficial effect in helping to reduce ambient particle concentrations, which remain above desirable levels for all but a handful of SHUE cities within the European Region. All cities, including those with the lowest levels, would benefit from further reduction in PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub>, which would likely follow from the transition towards a low carbon economy (
 <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>). Important determinants include socioeconomic development, which explains some of the gradients in ambient concentrations across the region, and city size. While for higher income cities, which generally have better emission controls, ambient levels were somewhat correlated with the number of cities within 500 km; this correlation was not seen once adjustment was made for income and metropolitan population. Such a relationship is probable because of the long-range transport of polluted air masses, but the absence of clear relationship here may in part reflect the simplicity of the marker and the influence of other confounding factors.
