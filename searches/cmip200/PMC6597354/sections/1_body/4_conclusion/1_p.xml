There are multiple databases relating to city characteristics, but the unique contribution of the SHUE project is to assemble data and methods of analysis that have bearing on questions of both health and sustainability. Realising the potential of the database for the research and policy communities will be greater the more it is used. The current priority is to work with potential users to explore the degree to which city-to-city comparisons and modelling can best help support policy development in pursuit of health and sustainability goals.</p>
