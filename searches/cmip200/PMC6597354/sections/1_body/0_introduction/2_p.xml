<p id="P6" class="p">The Sustainable Healthy Urban Environments (SHUE) project is an initiative to support policy development in areas relating to these environmental and health challenges and opportunities. Its aim is to test the feasibility and methods of assembling data about the characteristics of a globally distributed sample of cities, and the populations within them, for comparative analyses, and to use such data to assess how policies may contribute to sustainable urban development and human health. Its specific objectives are to: understand the reasons for city-to-city differences in measures of sustainable development and health-related exposures and behaviours; assess the potential to improve population health through strategies for achieving greater environmental sustainability and resilience to evolving environmental threats; and identify possible policies and interventions whose impacts on health and sustainability may be subject to future evaluation studies.</p>
