<p id="P19" class="p">Data, from the most recent years of available data for each city, was analysed by simple tabulation and graphical methods to examine the uni-variate and bivariate distribution of environmental characteristics across cities. Where there was no data for a given city, the city was excluded from that part of the analysis. We show data for all global cities in the database, with those for the WHO European Region highlighted to set the European data in the global context. For air pollution, we also present an analysis of the determinants of variation in city-level PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> concentrations to illustrate the degree to which levels for individual cities appear to be higher or lower than those of comparable cities. This analysis was based on a multiple regression model in which PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> concentrations were modelled as a function of three key determinants: the level of socioeconomic development (per capita GDP), city size (population of the wider metropolitan area), and the number of cities within 500 km of the index city. The relationship with each parameter was fitted using natural cubic splines of the relevant variable, implemented using Stataâ€™s 
 <italic class="italic">mkspline</italic> function with three internal knots. All analyses were carried out in Stata v14 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA).
