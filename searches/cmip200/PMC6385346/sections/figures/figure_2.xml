  <p class="p">CMIP5 ensemble mean considerably underestimates absolute increase of GPP for a doubling of pre-industrial atmospheric CO
   <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration (2 × CO
   <sub class="sub">2</sub>). 
   <bold class="bold">a</bold> Observations (black) and CMIP5 historical simulations (colors) of the first principal component of annual mean atmospheric CO
   <sub class="sub">2</sub> and annual growing degree days above 0 °C (ω) versus the annual LAI
   <sub class="sub">max</sub>. All quantities are area weighted and spatially averaged for NHL (60°N–90°N). 
   <bold class="bold">b</bold> Bar chart showing the corresponding slopes of the best linear fits, where the gray bar at the top indicates the standard error. Linear trends are derived for the period 1982–2016 for observations and 1971–2005 for model simulations, maximizing the overlap and sample size. 
   <bold class="bold">c</bold> Linear relationship between the sensitivity of annual LAI
   <sub class="sub">max</sub> to ω (
   <italic class="italic">x</italic> axis) and the absolute increase of high-latitude GPP at 2 × CO
   <sub class="sub">2</sub>. Each model is represented by an individually colored marker with error bars indicating one standard deviation (
   <italic class="italic">y</italic> axis) and standard error (
   <italic class="italic">x</italic> axis). The black solid line shows observed sensitivity, where the gray shading indicates the respective standard error. The blue line shows the best linear fit across the CMIP5 ensemble including the 68% confidence interval estimated by bootstrapping (blue shading; Methods). The intersection of the blue and black line gives the Emergent Constraint on ∆GPP at 2 × CO
   <sub class="sub">2</sub> (dashed black line). 
   <bold class="bold">d</bold> Probability density functions resulting from Emergent Constraint (blue) and CMIP5 ensemble mean estimates (red, assuming Gaussian distribution). Details in Methods
