  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">30</xref>
 </sup> and general enhancement of GPP, the CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration is increasingly tugged downward relative to the steady increasing trend. At both stations, the drawdown slope decreased over a period of 30 years (ALT: −1.04 ± 0.18 ppm month

 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and BRW: −0.68 ± 0.12 ppm month
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> 30 yr
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3c</xref>; Methods). The models also show a decreasing slope but disagree on the magnitude (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3c</xref>). Again, we note that the MIROC-ESM best reproduces the observed change in drawdown slope at both stations. Likewise, HadGEM2-ES considerably overestimates and CESM1-BGC underestimates the decline of the drawdown slope. According to the hypothesized EC approach (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>), this is rooted in MIROC-ESM correctly capturing the sensitivity of an observable (LAI
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b</xref> or BRW and ALT drawdown slope in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3c</xref>) to CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration. Consequently, this agreement in changes in CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> drawdown slope between long-term measurements and the closest-to-observations model in terms of greening sensitivity provides further support for the EC estimate of ΔGPP at 2 × CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and suggests that the multi-model mean is a large underestimate.
