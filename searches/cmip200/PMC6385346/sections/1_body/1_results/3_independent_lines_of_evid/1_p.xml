<p id="Par9" class="p">First, the seasonal cycle of CO

 </sup>. Analyses of long-term measurements at NHL stations, Point Barrow (BRW, Alaska) and Alert Nunavut (ALT, Canada), reveal that this seasonal cycle has changed over time, dominated by a decreasing trend in the annual CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> minimum (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a, b</xref>). Nearly all of this change can be attributed to the land, as the trend in the abutting Arctic Ocean flux is ~15 times smaller (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3d</xref>; Methods). This strengthening of the seasonal swings of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration relates to photosynthesis rather than respiration changes

 </sup> and thus features changes in GPP. So, if the EC estimate is closer to the true value of ΔGPP at 2 × CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, then, models matching the EC estimate (e.g., MIROC-ESM) must also better simulate the changing CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> seasonal cycle measured at the NHL stations, in comparison to models that over- (e.g., HadGEM2-ES) or underestimate (e.g., CESM1-BGC). Indeed, the MIROC-ESM best reproduces the average observed seasonal cycle, and critically, the change in summertime minimum over time at both stations, in comparison to the other models (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a, b</xref>). None of the models reproduce the observed phase of the seasonal cycle, which suggests a recurring problem among models in their representation of vegetation phenology

 </sup>. Nevertheless, the model that projects ΔGPP matching the LAI
 <sub class="sub">max</sub>-based EC estimate is also the one that best captures the changes in observed seasonal cycle suggesting that the EC estimate, rather than the corresponding multi-model mean, best represents the true value of ΔGPP at 2 × CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. Thus, the multi-model mean is a large underestimate.
