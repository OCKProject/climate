 </sup>. To avoid redundancy from co-linearity between the two driver variables, but retain their underlying time-trend and interannual variability (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>), we use the dominant mode from a principal component analysis (PCA) of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and GDD0 as the proxy driver (denoted ω) in subsequent analysis (Methods). Expressed in this compact form, greenness level (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref>) as well as greening sensitivity to ω (hereafter greening sensitivity, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b</xref>) span a wide range across the multi-model ensemble. All models with low greenness levels (LAI
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> &lt; 0.75 m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>) tend to simulate low greening sensitivities (&lt; 0.015 m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> LAI
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> per 1 unit ω), relative to observations. These models (NorESM1-ME, CESM1-BGC, and CanESM2) lack a representation of dynamic vegetation, i.e., do not allow plant functional type shifts in response to changing simulated climate, and/or show overly strong nitrogen limitations on plant growth and thus fail to capture GPP enhancement and its re-investment in green leaf area (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>). The other four models behave randomly—some reproduce observed greenness levels (LAI
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> ~1.7 m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>) but not the greening sensitivities (~0.045 m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> LAI
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> per 1 unit ω) and the others vice versa. Whether this is because these four models in common lack carbon–nitrogen interactions, or are missing some other key processes, is not known

 </sup>, but the end result is a large range in model simulated greening sensitivity (hereafter LAI
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> sensitivity), during the historical period (0.022–0.075 m
