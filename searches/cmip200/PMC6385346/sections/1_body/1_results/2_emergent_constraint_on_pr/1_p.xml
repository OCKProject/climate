<p id="Par8" class="p">What is known, however, is the strong linear relationship between modeled contemporaneous changes in LAI
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> and GPP arising from the combined radiative and physiological effects of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> enrichment in the range 1 × CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> to 2 × CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (Supplementary Figs. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref>). As a result, models with low LAI
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> sensitivity (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b</xref>) project lower ΔGPP for a given increment of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration, and vice versa. Thus, the large variation in modeled historical LAI
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> sensitivities (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b</xref>) linearly maps to variation in ΔGPP at 2 × CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2c</xref>; 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.98, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.0001), with the consequence that the uncertainty of the multi-model mean ΔGPP is large enough to undermine its value—e.g., 2.1 ± 1.91 Pg C yr
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> for 2 × CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> in NHL. This linear relation in inter-model variation between ΔGPP at 2 × CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and historical LAI
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> sensitivities allows using the observed sensitivity as an EC on GPP estimation at 2 × CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. Moreover, the probability contours about the best linear fit together with the uncertainty of observed sensitivity (blue and gray shadings in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2c</xref>) allow a robust characterization of the constrained estimate

 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> for 2 × CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> in NHL (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2d</xref>). This EC estimate is 60% larger than the multi-model mean value. Wenzel et al.

 </sup> reported a similar result for NHL (37 ± 9% versus 20–25% for relative GPP increase at 2 × CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) and a somewhat smaller number for the extra-tropical vegetation in the northern hemisphere, both for the physiological effect only (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">4</xref> shows that the radiative and physiological effects each contribute about half of the total GPP enhancement). Together, these results indicate that most models are largely underestimating photosynthetic carbon fixation, which is in contrast to previous studies

 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. Below, we provide three independent lines of evidence, i.e., not using LAI
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> but atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> measurements, to buttress our EC estimate.
