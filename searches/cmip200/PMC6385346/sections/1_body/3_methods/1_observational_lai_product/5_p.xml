The sensor-platforms are regularly adjusted to maintain precise orbits. All algorithms, including the LAI algorithm, are physics-based, well-tested and currently producing the sixth generation data sets. The results, not shown here for brevity, illustrate global scale greening, across all latitudinal zones and broad vegetation classes. Zhang et al.
