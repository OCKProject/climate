<p id="Par16" class="p">For both, observational and CMIP5 data, LAI is defined as the one-sided green leaf area per unit ground area in broadleaf canopies and as one-half the green needle surface area in needleleaf canopies. It is expressed in units of m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> green leaf area per m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> ground area. In this study, we use the annual maximum value of LAI, LAI
 <sub class="sub">max</sub>, to quantify the greenness level of a surface. LAI
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> is less influenced by cloudiness and noise; accordingly, it is most useful in investigations of long-term greening and browning trends. The drawback of LAI
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> is the saturation effect at high LAI values

 <sub class="sub">max</sub> values typically in the range of 2â€“3.
