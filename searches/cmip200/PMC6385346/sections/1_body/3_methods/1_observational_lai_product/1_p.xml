 </sup>. It was generated using an artificial neural network (ANN) and the latest version (third generation) of the Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies group (GIMMS) Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data (NDVI3g). The latter has been corrected for sensor degradation, intersensor differences, cloud cover, solar zenith angle, viewing angle effects due to satellite drift, Rayleigh scattering, and stratospheric volcanic aerosols
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">36</xref>
 </sup>. The ANN model was trained with overlapping data of NDVI3g and Collection 6 Terra MODIS LAI product

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">38</xref>
 </sup>, and then applied to the full NDVI3g time series to generate the LAI3gV1 data set. This data set provides global and year-round LAI observations at 15-day (bi-monthly) temporal resolution and 1/12 degree spatial resolution from July 1981 to December 2016. Currently, it is the only data set that spans this long period.
