<p id="Par35" class="p">For the BRW record, the 30 years of continuous overlap with the CMIP5 historical simulations were used to calculate the drawdown slopes (1974â€“2005). Due to the shorter overlap in the ALT record, 30 years of data from 1985 (start of measuring campaign) to 2015 were used for comparison with models. This is legitimate, because the CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration rate of increment for both periods are just about the same. Model time series are obtained from the near-surface CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration using the grid box in close proximity to each site. All yearly time series are slightly smoothed with a 2-year moving window. Changes are calculated from 5-year averages at the beginning and end of the record. Here, we only present a low-end, high-end and the closest-to-observation model from the greening EC analysis, because Wenzel et al.
