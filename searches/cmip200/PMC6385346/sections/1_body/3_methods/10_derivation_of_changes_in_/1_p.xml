 </sup> showed that NHL CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> drawdown mostly happens in June and July. ESMs, however, disagree on the phase, mainly due to a premature start of the growing season (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a, b</xref>). As a consequence, the CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> drawdown in models peaks earlier in the season. To obtain comparability for changes in CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> drawdown strength, we calculate the first derivative of the CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration time series for the observational sites and each model individually. The annual minimum of the derivative in each time series reflects the months where the increase in photosynthetic CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fixation is strongest (CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> drawdown slope). This procedure does not require a detrending of the atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> signal.
