<p id="Par27" class="p">The global temperature fields from the reanalysis and model data are cropped to the northern high latitudinal band and averaged in space. The resulting one-dimensional time-series is converted to GDD above 0 °C by multiplying the days of each month with the respective monthly mean estimate if it is above 0 °C. Thus, we not only capture the warming signal, but also the prolongation of the growing season.</p>
