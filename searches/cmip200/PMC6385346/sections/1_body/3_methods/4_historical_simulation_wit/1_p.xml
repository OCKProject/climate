<p id="Par24" class="p">MPI-ESM-HR is the coupled high-resolution setup of the latest version of the Max-Planck-Institute Earth System Model MPI-ESM1.2, which is the baseline for the upcoming Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). Here, the atmospheric component ECHAM6.3 has 95 vertical levels and twice the horizontal resolution (~100 km) than the CMIP5 version. The ocean component MPIOM is set up on a tripolar grid at nominal 0.4° horizontal resolution (TP04) and 40 vertical levels. MPI-ESM1.2 includes the latest versions of the land and ocean carbon cycle modules, comprising the ocean biogeochemistry model HAMOCC and the land surface scheme JSBACH. The forcing components for the historical simulation are chosen from CMIP5 (Methods) as at the time the simulations were conducted CMIP6 forcing was not available
