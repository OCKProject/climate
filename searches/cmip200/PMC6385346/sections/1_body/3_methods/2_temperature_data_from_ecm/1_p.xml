The global temperature fields were retrieved at a resolution of 0.5° × 0.5° for monthly mean estimates derived from daily means. Other reanalysis products with similar specifications (NCEP/NCAR reanalysis, University of Delaware Air Temperature &amp; Precipitation, and GHCN/CAMS reanalysis product) were also investigated. The differences among the various products were found to be minor.
