<p id="Par37" class="p">We require the use of a fully coupled ESM to separate between land and ocean in terms of the sign, magnitude, and seasonal cycle of the respective net carbon exchange fluxes with the atmosphere. We have access to a spatially-high resolved historical run (10 realizations) of the MPI-ESM which has the ability to reproduce seasonality in the Arctic Ocean (Methods). The terrestrial carbon pools have not been brought into equilibrium due to computational limitations in these high-resolution simulations. Thus, we use simulations from the same model but at low spatial resolution (3 realizations), the CMIP5 esmHistorical simulation, to address land carbon exchange fluxes (Methods).</p>
