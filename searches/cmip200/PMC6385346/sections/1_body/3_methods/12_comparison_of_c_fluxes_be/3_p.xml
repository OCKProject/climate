<p id="Par39" class="p">During the months from May to September (may-to-sep) when photosynthetic CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> drawdown is happening, the change in land sink is about 0.4 Pg C on an annual basis. Especially between May and July, the CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration is rapidly declining, i.e., photosynthesis prevails CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> release processes. Thus, nearly the entire increase of 0.4 Pg C can be attributed to increasing NPP. The EC analysis shows that the MPI-ESM model is rather close to observations but generally underestimating greening sensitivity and thus also the GPP enhancement. These results are not provided as further proof of the EC estimate, although they are not contradictory, they are provided to compare the strength of NHL land and Arctic Ocean carbon sinks and why the ocean component can be neglected.
