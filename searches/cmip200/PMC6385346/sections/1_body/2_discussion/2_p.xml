<p id="Par13" class="p">Although the Arctic represents only a small fraction of the terrestrial biosphere, the rapid climatic changes in NHL and uncertainties associated with the net carbon balance emphasize the need for further detailed analysis. The tendency for GPP underestimation in NHL by models reported here is also seen at the global scale (Supplementary Fig.Â
