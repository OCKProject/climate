 <p id="Par2" class="p">The terrestrial biosphere absorbs a large fraction of emitted CO
  <sub class="sub">2</sub>, and thus, plays a critical role in climate change projections. Here, the authors use satellite leaf area and in-situ CO
  <sub class="sub">2</sub> measurements to show that most Earth system models largely underestimate photosynthetic carbon fixation in high latitudes.
