 <p id="Par1" class="p">Most Earth system models agree that land will continue to store carbon due to the physiological effects of rising CO
  <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration and climatic changes favoring plant growth in temperature-limited regions. But they largely disagree on the amount of carbon uptake. The historical CO
  <sub class="sub">2</sub> increase has resulted in enhanced photosynthetic carbon fixation (Gross Primary Production, GPP), as can be evidenced from atmospheric CO
  <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration and satellite leaf area index measurements. Here, we use leaf area sensitivity to ambient CO
  <sub class="sub">2</sub> from the past 36 years of satellite measurements to obtain an Emergent Constraint (EC) estimate of GPP enhancement in the northern high latitudes at two-times the pre-industrial CO
  <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration (3.4 ± 0.2 Pg C yr
  <sup class="sup">−1</sup>). We derive three independent comparable estimates from CO
  <sub class="sub">2</sub> measurements and atmospheric inversions. Our EC estimate is 60% larger than the conventionally used multi-model average (44% higher at the global scale). This suggests that most models largely underestimate photosynthetic carbon fixation and therefore likely overestimate future atmospheric CO
  <sub class="sub">2</sub> abundance and ensuing climate change, though not proportionately.
