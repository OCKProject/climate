Results from the Real-5 GCMs are plotted in thin colored lines, while the Other GCMs are outlined in gray. Thick curves represent the ensemble averages of the Real-5 GCMs (red), the Other 11 GCMs (green) and the full ensemble of 16 GCMs (blue). Thick black curve delineates the annual total (
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>), AR-related (
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>) and non-AR (
   <bold class="bold">c</bold>) precipitation, which is based on observed precipitation data. Trends and their significance are quantified in Table
