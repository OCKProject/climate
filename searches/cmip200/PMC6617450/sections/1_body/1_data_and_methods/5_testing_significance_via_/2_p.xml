<p id="Par40" class="p">We applied a similar approach to testing whether the ensemble average trend in total precipitation projected by the Real-5 GCMs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4a</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S5</xref>) were significant with respect to a distribution of such trends as projected by 2000 randomly selected 5-member ensembles, i.e. bootstrapped distribution. The Real-5 trend corresponded to the 96
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> percentile of the bootstrapped distribution of trends, prompting us to conclude that it was not significant in a two-tailed test with 95% confidence. Specifically, although significant as trends go, we cannot confidently rule out the possibility that it could have resulted from random sampling of GCMs.
