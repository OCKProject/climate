<p id="Par37" class="p">The models with the most realistic climatologies with respect to AR day frequency and AR precipitation contribution to the annual total are those with the highest spatial correlation and lowest RMSE (lower right corner of Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>, panels a and b, respectively). We highlight the most realistic five models (Real-5) in Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>. CNRM-CM5 produces an AR climatology similar to the SIO-R1 reference dataset. These are: CNRM-CM5, CanESM2, ACCESS1-0, ACCESS1-3 and GFDL-CM3. CanESM2, ACCESS1-0 and ACCESS1-3 underestimate AR day frequency, while GFDL-CM3 overestimates AR day frequency during the historical period (see Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref> in the Supplementary materials). The Real-5 ensemble average AR climatology shows the best agreement (red asterisks on Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1a,b</xref>) with the observed climatology. It is noteworthy that the Real-5 GCMs were also independently selected for California Water resources planning
