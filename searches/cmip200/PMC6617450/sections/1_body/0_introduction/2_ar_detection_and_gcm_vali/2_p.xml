<p id="Par7" class="p">Projected changes are mainly quantified as differences between the second half of the 20th century (1951–2000 water years: 
 <italic class="italic">historical period</italic>) and that of the 21st (2051–2100: 
 <italic class="italic">future period</italic>), although changes occurring by and in the

The years referred to here encompass the AR year along the West Coast (from July 1 to June 30). These are numbered consistently with Water Years, i.e. an AR landfalling in November of year
