<p id="Par9" class="p">The exercise of model validation with respect to the realism of simulated AR activity (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>) allowed us to constrain the range of GCM projections considered. For example, Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref> shows that, while projected increase in West Coast AR event frequency ranges from 4–35% across all models, the range for the Real-5 models narrows to 19–26% (a statistically significant result, see Section 5e). Therefore, unless otherwise stated, the results presented below concentrate on the most realistic models by averaging across the Real-5 models highlighted in Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>.
