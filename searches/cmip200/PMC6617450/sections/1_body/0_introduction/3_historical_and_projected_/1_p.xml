 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>). Some GCMs are unrealistically dry, but most are wet, some severely overestimating AR activity, i.e. event maximum intensity (Fig.

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2a</xref>) and duration (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2b</xref>). The Real-5 GCMs are well in line with observed AR activity. No consistent historical trends are clearly evident in the models’ AR intensity, frequency and duration time series overall (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>). The observed AR activity (represented by the SIO R1 catalog
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>
 </sup>), however, has declined over the West Coast, significantly with respect to duration, during the historical period. This is likely due to natural decadal variability and may explain the lack of increasing trends in observed intense precipitation in the West

 </sup>. The models’ internal variability, which largely determines trends during the historical period, is obviously not expected to be in phase with that observed and can result in trends of different sign in different model runs

 </sup>. The observed negative trend is consistent with 6 of the 16 GCM historical realizations (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>). During the current half-century (2001–2050), the forced response begins to dominate and AR activity in GCMs begins to clearly trend up. When the GCMs are averaged annually, which filters natural variability, the ensemble average trends emerge as significant in all variables in the Real-5, Other, and Full Ensembles. AR activity ramps up and continues to rise until the end of the century significantly in all GCMs. For AR landfalls along the California coast (rather than the entire West Coast; Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>), trend significance (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref>) is limited by the larger natural variability associated with the shorter coastline and consequently a smaller sample of ARs landfalling there. Nevertheless, upward trends begin to clearly emerge as significant during the current half-century and continue to intensify in coming decades.
