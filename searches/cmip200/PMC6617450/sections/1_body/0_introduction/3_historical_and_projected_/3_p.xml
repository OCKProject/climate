 </sup>. Global warming manifests as a general bolstering of this climatological AR seasonality, making landfalls more frequent and intense at the peak of the AR season as well as broadening the season, particularly forward in time, i.e. deeper into winter (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref>), even as the frequency of precipitation from other more common storms (mainly frontal cyclones) decreases, particularly in the shoulder seasons and in California

 </sup>. Along with enhanced frequency and intensity of AR landfalls, the duration of ARs is also projected to increase (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref>). This is not surprising given the increase in AR intensity combined with use of fixed IVT (&gt;250 kg/m/s) and integrated water vapor (IWV) thresholds to define ARs
