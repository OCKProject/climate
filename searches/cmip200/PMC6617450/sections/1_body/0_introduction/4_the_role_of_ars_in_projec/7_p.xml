<p id="Par17" class="p">In summary, in the West, and particularly along the West Coast, AR contributions to total precipitation are increasing (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2d</xref>). The more intense AR-related precipitation drives up average precipitation intensity (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S5</xref>), particularly on the WSW- and South-facing slopes of coastal topography, while all precipitation frequency is decreasing (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S6</xref>, top row) and the frequency of AR-related precipitation contributions is increasing (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S6</xref>, bottom row). In other words, ARs are responsible for the projected increase in total precipitation, specifically over California (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S7</xref>). This is in spite of decreasing precipitation frequency there (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S6</xref>, top row), which results in greater interannual precipitation volatility (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>) as more of the annual total is accumulated from a decreasing sample of intensifying, and increasingly AR-related, precipitation events. These results clarify the meteorological mechanisms behind previous results on projected increasing precipitation volatility in California

 </sup>. Interestingly, the Real-5 GCMs tend to project a wetter future over California (Figs 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S6</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S7</xref>), and although this is significant and noteworthy given that the full ensemble of 16 GCMs is vague on the sign of the overall trend (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4a</xref>, Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S5</xref>), this result is likely to have arisen due to random sampling of GCMs (see Section 5e). Also noteworthy is the greater decrease in non-AR-related precipitation projected for California in the 
 <italic class="italic">Other</italic> models compared to that in the Real-5 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4c</xref>, Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S5</xref>). The stronger increasing trends in AR-related precipitation and a weaker decreasing trend in non-AR-related precipitation combine to increase the total precipitation in California, according to the Real-5 GCMs as compared to the rest of the full ensemble of 16 GCMs examined here (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S5</xref>). Again, though, we cannot be confident in this significant trend in total annual precipitation given the bootstrapped likelihood of similar trends due to random sampling of GCMs.
