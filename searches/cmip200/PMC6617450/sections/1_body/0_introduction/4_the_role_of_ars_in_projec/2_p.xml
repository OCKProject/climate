<p id="Par12" class="p">In the Chehalis River basin (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref>), the projected increase in the frequency of dry days (&lt;0.1 mm), drizzle (0.1 mm &lt;=p &lt; 10th %-ile) and low-intensity precipitation (between the 10th and 20th %-iles) is mostly explained by changes in the frequency of non-AR events. The projected decrease in the frequency of medium-intensity precipitation (between 30
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> and 90
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> %-iles) is mostly accounted for by strong declines in non-AR events, while ARs are projected to partially counteract this decrease, i.e. contribute more medium intensity precipitation. As far as heavy (between the 90
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> and 99th %-iles) and extreme (&gt;99
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> %-ile) precipitation, frequency of days in these categories increases due to ARs. In fact, AR contributions increase in all precipitation bins, with the increases becoming greater at higher intensities, while non-AR precipitation contribution is projected to become more frequent in the drizzle and other low-intensity precipitation categories, and decreasing at higher intensities.
