<p class="p">In addition, from a farm herd point of view, even if individual cow milk yields could benefit from heat abatements as estimated here, other factors that may be related to climate change, including change in spatio-temporal insect infestation patterns and change in feed crops availability and quality [

Heat stress has a significant adverse impact on the physiologic functions of dry cows, and milk production could benefit from dry period cooling [

Therefore, to enhance the effects of heat abatement at the farm level, dairy producers should consider addressing heat stress impacts not only for lactating cows, but also at other stages of production (calf, heifer, and dry cow). Adoption of heat abatement at all stages of production could alter the cost-benefit ratios estimated in this study.
