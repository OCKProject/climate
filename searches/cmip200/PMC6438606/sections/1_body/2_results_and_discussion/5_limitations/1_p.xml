<p class="p">Expert knowledge suggests that extended heat stress events have lasting impacts on cow welfare, and by extension, a greater impact on productivity. In one particular study conducted under controlled conditions in Brazil, Ferrazza et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0214665.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>] estimated that cows exposed to THIs greater than 75 had consistently lower dry matter intake (DMI) after a period of 3 days. On average across the U.S., the average number of consecutive days during which mean daily THI stays above the threshold THI (70) is expected to rise from 7 in late-20
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> century to 13 in late-21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century, under the higher scenario. If we speculate that the number of consecutive days with THI above 75 will increase as well, adverse effects on DMI of dairy cows, and consequently on milk production, would clearly be expected. In this study, we assumed that heat abatement implementation reduced the daily degree of THI experienced by dairy cows. However, if the resultant daily THI stays above 75 for more than a 3-day period as suggested by the Ferrazza et al., there could be long-term lasting impacts on milk production, hence on the balance between costs and benefits.
