<p class="p">As expected, the severity of milk production losses is likely to decrease across all regions with the implementation of subsequently stronger levels of heat abatement throughout the 21

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0214665.g005" class="xref">Fig 5</xref>) that enable reductions in mean daily THI (especially daily maximum THI) and HSF. Reductions in mean daily THI will potentially lessen the impacts of heat stress on lactating dairy cows, allowing them to better utilize the energy they obtain from feeds, thus improving feeding efficiency [

 <xref rid="pone.0214665.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>], as cows are expected to spend less time dissipating heat (increased water consumption, increased breathing rate). On average, under Moderate, High, and Intense heat abatements, annual milk production per cow is expected to increase by 3%, 4%, and 6% during early-21

 <xref rid="pone.0214665.ref075" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>]. If this increasing trend holds, the higher producing cows may become more sensitive to heat stress. Therefore, stronger heat abatement appears necessary in the future to maintain dairy cows in physiologically thermoneutral states.
