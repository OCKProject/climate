<p class="p">Results demonstrated that all four heat abatements may provide significant heat stress relief, hence lowering milk production losses per cow in all regions. Ultimately, Intense heat abatement would yield the largest milk production across all regions. However, Intense heat abatement would be more expensive to implement, and may not return much greater milk production than High heat abatement. This is particularly true for some regions (Northeast and Upper Midwest) in early-21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century, as differences in milk production loss per cow between the two heat abatements were generally insignificant (

 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century again between High and Intense heat abatements at some locations in the Northeast (Montpelier, VT and State College, PA) and Upper Midwest (Lansing, MI), and between Moderate and High heat abatements in the Northwest (Tillamook, OR). In Phoenix (Southwest region), significant effects on milk production were estimated only under High and Intense heat abatement. In late-21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century, heat abatements stronger than Minimal were not effective at Tillamook, OR, and Intense heat abatement was not much more effective than High heat abatement.
