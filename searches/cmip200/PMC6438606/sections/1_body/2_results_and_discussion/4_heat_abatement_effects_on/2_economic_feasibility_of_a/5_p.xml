<p class="p">Cost-benefit ratio sensitivity analyses showed that annual profits could be positively affected by cost differentials between naturally and mechanically ventilated barns, fan installation and operation costs, discount rates, and inversely affected by milk prices (

Of the 9 variables we explored in the sensitivity analyses, barn cost differences had by far the largest influence on annual profits. Therefore, for dairy producers, lowering capital costs of mechanically ventilated barns would be critical to determining the economic viability of heat abatement implementation at the farm level.
