<p class="p">Mean milk production losses under early-21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century weather conditions in the Northeast, Upper Midwest, Northern Rockies, and Northwest regions were at first relatively low under Minimal heat abatement (&lt;400 kg/cow/year, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0214665.g005" class="xref">Fig 5</xref>), and there was not incentive for heat abatement. Therefore, the implementation of heat abatement was not economically supported regardless of the abatement level (cost-benefit ratio &gt;1, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0214665.g006" class="xref">Fig 6</xref>). In the Southeast and South regions where mean milk production losses under Minimal abatement approached 1,500 kg/cow/year, the cost-benefit ratios were &lt;1 under the Moderate, High, and Intense heat abatements, yielding $60±30 /cow/year, $150±50 /cow/year, and $160±60 /cow/year in profit for the Southeast, and $30±10 /cow/year, $110±20 /cow/year, and $190±30 /cow/year in profit for the South, respectively. Cost-benefit ratios &lt;1 were also estimated for the Ohio Valley under High and Intense heat abatements (estimated annual profits were $60±30 /cow for each) and for the Southwest region under Intense heat abatements (estimated annual profit was $200±170 /cow). The estimated mean annual profit for the Southwest region under High heat abatement was $40±40 /cow, but the mean cost-benefit ratio was weighted toward more than one by the ratio determined for Richfield, UT. Similarly, the West region would experience annual profits under High and Intense heat abatements ($20±30 /cow and $60±70 /cow, respectively) although the mean cost-benefit ratios indicated otherwise due to elevated ratios for Elko, NV. Compared to the other locations in their respective regions, Richfield, UT and Elko, NV experienced lower maximum and minimum THI (75.2±0.1 to 76.0±0.1 and 44.1±0.1 to 45.1±0.1, respectively,
