<p class="p">During mid-21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century, mean base milk production losses (under Minimal heat abatement) were relatively high in the Southeast, Ohio Valley, and South regions (&gt;1000 kg/cow/year), and significant production increases were projected under Moderate, High, and Intense heat abatements, making abatement implementation economically feasible at these three levels. Between the three heat abatements, these regions could receive annually $50±10 /cow to $270±70 /cow, $10±10 /cow to $90±40 /cow, and $30±10 /cow to $290±30 /cow in profit, respectively. High and Intense heat abatements were also economical options for the Northeast, Upper Midwest, Northern Rockies, Southwest, and West regions, as the average milk production increases at these levels were significant enough to compensate for their costs of implementation. Across these regions, the estimated annual profits ranged from $10±10 /cow to $70±40 /cow and $0±10 /cow to $330±200 /cow for the High and Intense heat abatements, respectively. However, High heat abatement appeared to deliver the largest annual profits in the Northeast and Upper regions ($10±10 /cow/year for High abatement vs. $0±20 /cow/year for Intense abatement). All the regions except Southeast and West experienced profitability under High and Intense heat abatements during late-21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century (estimated annual profits were $20±20 /cow to $160±20 /cow and $90±10 /cow to $590±250 /cow for High and Intense heat abatements, respectively). The Southeast and West regions experienced profitability under the Moderate heat abatement, with annual profits amounting to $10±10 /cow. The lack of profit under Moderate heat abatement indicated that milk losses under late-21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century weather conditions would not be amenable to beneficial milk production across most regions in the U.S. if at least High heat abatement is not implemented (except Southeast and West regions). Ultimately, Intense heat abatement would deliver the largest profits.
