<p class="p">Overall, basic trends indicated that higher levels of heat abatement (High and Intense) are expected to become increasingly cost-effective later in the century for all regions, under the higher scenario, even the northerly locales that seem to be buffered against heat stress in the early- and mid-21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century. As the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century progresses, dairy producers will likely need to switch to stronger heat abatement to mitigate the effects of heat stress on milk production, especially in late-21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century. The Northeast, Upper Midwest, and Northern Rockies would not benefit from heat abatement until mid-21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century, during which implementing High heat abatement would be most cost-effective. The Northwest region would benefit from Intense heat abatement only during late-21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century.
