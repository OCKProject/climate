<p class="p">Heat abatements generally lowered the impacts of increasing heat stress and returned greater milk production across the U.S. regions during the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century, under the RCP 8.5 scenario. Their economic feasibility was generally supported, nonetheless some regions showed no expectation of profits during some periods of the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century. Profits in this paper were the marginal net returns related to the implementation of Moderate, High, and Intense heat abatements relative to the Minimal heat abatement (base scenario), and did not refer to the earnings of the entire milk production activity.
