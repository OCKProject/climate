<p class="p">Overall, variability in late-20
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> century heat stress across the 9 U.S. regions was driven by variability in THI and HSF. HSF also accounted for most of the differences in heat stress between locations in the West and East regions, which was mainly due to humidity. Humidity was also an important heat stress driver in the Southeast region as compared to the other regions (high temperature, high humidity). In addition to geographical heat stress variability, larger THI ranges in the North suggested that cows experienced varying degrees of heat stress, giving them periodic opportunities to cool off and thereby lower adverse impacts on milk production [
