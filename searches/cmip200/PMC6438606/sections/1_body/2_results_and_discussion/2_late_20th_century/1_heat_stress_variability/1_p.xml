 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0214665.s003" class="xref">S3A and S3B Fig</xref>) in accordance with the July mean minimum and mean maximum THI trend described by St-Pierre et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0214665.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. In the northern U.S. (Northwest, Northern Rockies, Upper Midwest, Northeast), mean daily minimum and maximum THI varied between 38.1±0.1 to 50.1±0.1 and 72.4±0.1 to 76.1±0.1, respectively, whereas in the southern U.S. (West, Southwest, South, Ohio Valley, Southeast) mean daily minimum and maximum THI varied between 39.2±0.1 to 63.7±0.0 and 74.1±0.1 to 81.3±0.1. On average, the southern U.S. experienced smaller THI ranges (&lt;27) as compared to the northern U.S. (up to 37) (

In the northern regions, HSF varied between 1 and 54 day/year (mean = 22 day/year; 27 day/year in the Northeast region vs. 5 day/year in the Northwest region) whereas the southern U.S. experienced HSF between 3 and 209 day/year (mean = 86 day/year; 140 day/year in the Southeast region vs. 66 day/year in the Southwest region).
