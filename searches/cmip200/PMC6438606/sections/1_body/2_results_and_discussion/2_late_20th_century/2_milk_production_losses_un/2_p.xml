<p class="p">According to the National Animal Health Monitoring System (NAHMS) [
 <xref rid="pone.0214665.ref074" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>], 83% and 42% of all dairy operations in the U.S. used covered structures and shading, respectively, for lactating cows, with greater use of covered structures in the East than in the West during Summer (80% vs. 75%). Concurrently, 76% and 20% of all lactating cow operations in the U.S. used fans and tunnel ventilation for cooling, respectively, with a larger proportion used in the East. Notably, 25% of dairy operations in the U.S. cool their lactating cows with sprinklers or misters, with the largest use of these systems in the western U.S. [
 <xref rid="pone.0214665.ref074" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>]. Indeed, the percentage of U.S. dairy operations using covered structures and shading was not restricted to Minimal heat abatement, but most likely applied to the other heat abatements (Moderate, High, and Intense). As such, we speculated that a small percentage of dairy cow operations in the U.S. exclusively used Minimal heat abatement, and that even if milk production losses under Minimal heat abatement were regionally large (as noted in the Southern regions), average milk production losses at the national scale would be tempered.
