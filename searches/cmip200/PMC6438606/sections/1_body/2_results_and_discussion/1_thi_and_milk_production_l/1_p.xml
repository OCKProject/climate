<p class="p">To evaluate our THI estimation method, we compared the average minimum and maximum THI in July from 1950 to 2000 to values from St-Pierre et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0214665.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>], who estimated average minimum and maximum THI in July over a much longer period from 1871 to 2001. Mean July minimum and maximum THI estimates were generally within 14% and 7%, respectively, of values reported by St-Pierre et al. [

 <xref rid="pone.0214665.ref073" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>]) might have contributed to deviations in estimated THI. Our historic estimates of milk production loss per cow (1950 to 1999) generally correlated well with those from Mauger et al. [

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0214665.s002" class="xref">S2C Fig</xref>) and St-Pierre et al. [

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0214665.s002" class="xref">S2D Fig</xref>). Small discrepancies likely resulted from spatial scale differences. While St-Pierre et al. used observed historical state-level weather data, Mauger et al. used gridded data, and this study used site-specific simulated weather data with variable spacing (distance between points). Differences in averaging periods between this study and St-Pierre et al (50 years in this study vs. 130 years in St-Pierre et al.) may have also contributed to discrepancies.
