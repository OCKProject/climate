<p class="p">Dairy cows are expected to experience increased discomfort throughout the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century, under the RCP 8.5 scenario, as heat stress increases over time in response to rising temperatures. Average annual THI is generally expected to increase at faster rates in the northern regions as compared to southern regions (0.82 /decade in the North and 0.52 /decade in the South, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0214665.g003" class="xref">Fig 3A</xref>). Mean annual minimum THI is generally expected to increase faster than mean annual maximum THI between 2000 and 2100, and the rapid increase of minimum THI will expectedly lead to a reduction of the diurnal THI range, which again suggests that opportunities for cows to cool off after a daily period of heat stress will likely diminish. Overall, annual HSF (
