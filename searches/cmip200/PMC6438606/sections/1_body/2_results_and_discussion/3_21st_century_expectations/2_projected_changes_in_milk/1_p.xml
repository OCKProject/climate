<p class="p">U.S. milk production loss under Minimal heat abatement is projected to increase throughout the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century, under the RCP8.5 scenario, at a mean rate of 174Â±7 kg/cow/decade (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0214665.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>), with the fastest increase in the Southeast region (284 kg/cow/decade) and the slowest increase in the Northwest region (79 kg/cow/decade). These increases in milk production losses are in line with previous studies by Key and Sneering [
 <xref rid="pone.0214665.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>] and Mauger et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0214665.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>], which collectively highlight the Southeast region as the most vulnerable to heat stress impacts. According to data reported by the U.S. Department of Agriculture-National Agriculture Statistics Service [
 <xref rid="pone.0214665.ref075" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>], the average dairy cow produced 9,670 kg/year of milk between 2008 and 2014 across the U.S. Using this mean milk production for extrapolation, U.S. mean annual milk production per cow would decline by 11.6% on average (1.2% to 40.8% depending on the location) by mid-21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century, and by 20.8% on average (4.6% to 60.2%) by late-21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century, due to heat stress. Notably, this ignores potential changes in adaptation due to genetic and management improvements. Larger dairy cattle breeds with high milk production will be disproportionately affected by heat stress with greater milk losses [
 <xref rid="pone.0214665.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Our study estimated milk losses from 550 to 650 kg dairy cattle which is smaller than a large Holstein (&gt; 750 kg). High milk producing cows are more susceptible to heat stress than lower yielding breeds of dairy cattle [
 <xref rid="pone.0214665.ref076" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>]. Predicted future losses are therefore conservative if dairy cattle weight for the U.S. increases with the expansion of confinement strategies [
 <xref rid="pone.0214665.ref077" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">77</xref>], along with an increase in milk yield. Projected milk production losses could amount to large income losses for dairy producers. Certainly, there is a strong incentive to implement heat stress abatement measures throughout the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century that will support the U.S. dairy industry as climate change progresses. The projected losses in milk production per cow in the Southwest and West regions are of particular concern as these regions recently (2000 to 2016) expanded their milk production by 0.8% and 6.7%, respectively [
 <xref rid="pone.0214665.ref078" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>], and further expansions are expected in the coming decades.
