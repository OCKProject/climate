<p class="p">Findings from the study showed that annual mean THI, a key indicator of dairy cow heat stress, increased nationally, with the fastest rates of increase in the northern U.S. Heat stress frequency (number of days with mean THI&gt;70) also increased, especially in the West, Northeast, and Southeast regions. Annual milk production loss per cow were greatest in the West, Southwest, South, and Southeast regions, making these regions the most vulnerable to climate change for dairy production. Therefore, stronger heat abatement methods are needed across the southern U.S. early in the century, with increasingly intense heat abatement involving air cooling needed in most regions toward the end of the 21
