<p class="p">Examining heat abatement strategies in response to climate change, as was done in this study, advances our understanding of climate adaptation strategies for different dairy regions in the U.S., as well as their cost-effectiveness. In light of the need for High, and in some cases, Intense heat abatement in late-21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century, future studies of this sort should consider the full animal lifecycle effects of adopting such intense heat abatement, especially strategies that involve energy-intensive solutions like indoor air conditioning. Future studies could also consider investigating the economic effectiveness of new housing-based cooling technologies (e.g. heat exchanger beds) in association with herd management techniques (crowding avoidance, reduced time in hot holding locations), and diet and genetic manipulation, which may contribute further benefit in heat abatement.
