<p class="p">This study illustrates the use of deterministic models along with downscaled climate projections in assessing the impacts of heat stress abatement on milk production at local and regional scales. Under the RCP 8.5, downscaled projections of nine CMIP5 global climate models were used to estimate annual milk production loss per cow across nine climatic regions of the U.S., as well as to evaluate the technical and economic effectiveness of four subsequently stronger heat abatement strategies–Minimal, Moderate, High, and Intense–throughout the 21
