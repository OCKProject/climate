<p class="p">We performed all analyses in the R environment [
 <xref rid="pone.0214665.ref070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>] using the Agricolae package [
 <xref rid="pone.0214665.ref071" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>]. Total annual milk production loss per cow was calculated for each combination of location, GCM, and abatement level. We calculated annual heat stress frequency (HSF) as the annual count of days with mean THI (daily average of maximum and minimum THI) &gt; 70, for each combination of location and GCM. Coefficients of determination (R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) and percent biases (PBIAS) [
 <xref rid="pone.0214665.ref072" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>] were used to compare the THI and milk production loss estimates to calculated values reported in the literature. We used a one-way ANOVA followed by a post-hoc Tukeyâ€™s Honest Significant Difference test to compare milk production losses between abatement levels by time-frame at each location and within each climatic region. Although the analytical methods used in this study appeared straight forward and deterministic, GCMs projections have inherent uncertainties. As such, we used nine different models to account for these uncertainties, and therefore we feel that the use of ANOVA to differentiate between summaries was justified.
