<p class="p">To conduct an economic comparison of the heat abatement methods, we estimated the marginal milk production present income (benefits) and the present costs of implementation of each heat abatement (costs). The marginal milk production income was the revenue from the additional milk produced using a heat abatement method above the base production from Minimal heat abatement. We used the 1998–2000 market year average milk price of $0.31 /kg [

A heat abatement was considered economical if the cost-benefit ratio was equal to or less than 1. We assessed the sensitivity of the cost-benefit ratios to the different costs involved in their calculation. We also assessed the effects of milk price on the cost-benefit ratios.
