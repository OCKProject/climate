 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0214665.g001" class="xref">Fig 1B</xref>). We selected three periods in the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century [early (2015 to 2034), mid (2045 to 2064), and late (2081 to 2100)] and included one period in the 20
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> century (1981 to 2000) to serve as a benchmark for projected changes. Future milk production losses per cow from heat stress were estimated using site-specific climate projections and four levels of housing heat abatement. An economic analysis of housing-based heat abatements was completed using cost-benefit ratios.
