<p class="p">We used the method developed by Key and Sneering [
 <xref rid="pone.0214665.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>] to project daily dew point temperatures for the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century, assuming that daily dew point temperature can be approximated by daily minimum temperature and that the contemporary difference between monthly minimum temperature and monthly dew point temperature is conserved in the future. Using the projected daily mean temperature and dew point temperature, we projected daily mean relative humidity using the Clausius-Clapeyron approximation for saturation vapor pressure and the assumption of a fixed enthalpy of vaporization [
 <xref rid="pone.0214665.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. Details of daily mean dew point temperature and relative humidity projections for the 21

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0214665.s015" class="xref">S1 File</xref>. To evaluate the accuracy of the daily dew point temperature predictions, we compared the predictions to values reported by PRISM for the historical periods 2000 to 2010 [
 <xref rid="pone.0214665.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>], and found that predicted monthly and daily dew point temperature matched well with the observations (
