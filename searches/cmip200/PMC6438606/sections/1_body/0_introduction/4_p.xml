<p class="p">Currently, there is limited economic information to support dairy producers in decision making regarding heat abatement in a changing climate. A comprehensive cost-benefit analysis of dairy heat abatement strategies in the U.S. over this century will help dairy producers know the cost-efficacy of heat abatement to sustain production. Accordingly, our objectives were to examine potential heat stress variation and to evaluate the effectiveness of housing-based heat abatements to reduce milk production losses under a changing climate. This analysis was conducted for selected locations within nine climatic regions in the U.S. Understanding the local and regional effectiveness of different heat abatements enabled an assessment of their economic feasibility and determined the most effective strategies for the long term. Findings from this analysis will contribute to ongoing efforts by USDA-ARSâ€™s Dairy Agroecosystems Working Group (DAWG), which seeks to address the national grand challenge of advancing our knowledge of U.S. dairy adaptation strategies in a rapidly changing climate [
