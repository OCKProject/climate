<p class="p">Several studies in the past 40 years have discussed methods to abate dairy heat stress under current or future climate conditions [

 <xref rid="pone.0214665.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>] introduced the technical and economic implications of different housing-related abatement methods. They found that some form of abatement in addition to the simple use of mechanical ventilation is necessary for the U.S. dairy industry to prevent economic losses. However, their analysis was based on past climate data, starting from the beginning of the 20
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> century, and did not account for the climate variability expected in the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century. Additionally, St-Pierre et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0214665.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>] explored the opportunity cost of heat abatement at the state level and did not analyze the economic feasibility of different levels of heat abatement.
