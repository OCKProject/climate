<p class="p">Previous climate change studies highlighting the role of heat stress on dairy production have focused on direct impacts (climate change vs. heat stress, climate change vs. animal health, climate change vs. animal growth and / or production, etc.) rather than the mitigating potential of heat abatement strategies. Initial studies explored the impacts of climate change on the temperature humidity index (THI) [

Results from these studies suggest that the additional heat stress caused by global warming could increase milk production losses for the average U.S. dairy farm from 0.6% in 2010 to 1.4% in 2030 and may reach more than 2% in some states [
