<p class="p">In Model A, the external variables include only climate forcing, temperature and rainfall, as the influencing factors to the vector's development, vital rates and environmental carrying capacity for larvae, assuming ideal situation for fecundity rate. Model B expands Model A through two terms: the fecundity rate and the environmental carrying capacity for larvae. A human blood meal factor is included in the fecundity rate to account for the blood meals needed for the mosquito's reproduction. A larval site density is included in the environmental carrying capacity for larvae to account for human contributions to the larval (breeding) sites. The larval site density involves two factors: human population density and GDPpc (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" class="xref">Figure S1B</xref> and Equation 1B), to simulate the human creation of extra larval breeding sites.
