<p class="p">All the mosquitoes' vital rates (birth, death, and transition) depend on temperature and/or precipitation (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>). In addition, the egg-to-larva hatching fraction depends on the larval population and environmental carrying capacity, due to competition for survival (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>). The whole lifecycle from egg to adult takes one to a few weeks on average, depending on temperature and precipitation (
