<p class="p">Statistical modeling has been used to estimate vector presence, for example, from Kraemer et al. (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>) and Santos and Meneses (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>). Among environmental and climatic covariates, climatic conditions were the most important predictors of vector presence in this model, ahead of the vegetation parameter (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>). In contrast, urbanization accounted only for 2% of the variance, which is difficult to reconcile in light of large-scale domestication of 
 <italic class="italic">A. aegypti</italic> and adaptation to urban settings (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>). A possible explanation is that statistical niche models suffer from under-reporting and collection bias, inherent in even the most comprehensive global vector surveillance repository. Moreover, data on vector abundance are largely unavailable. Niche modeling is also affected, albeit indirectly, by socio-economic (e.g., land use) and public health factors (e.g., vector control activities), which in turn affect the presence/absence of
