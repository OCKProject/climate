<p class="p">However, most prior researches in this field have not dynamically adjusted the parameters in space and time, to reflect naturally occurring changes in weather and climate. Instead they have retained constant parameters throughout (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>), fixed seasonal variation (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>), or considered mainly temperature with limited or no rainfall (

 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>). Previous mathematical models have all focused on vector population dynamic for one or two specific areas only (

Our recent work has demonstrated that process-based mathematical modeling is a very good tool to study the vector infestation of new areas through its growth rate. We have shown how the climate change may affect the future infestation of
