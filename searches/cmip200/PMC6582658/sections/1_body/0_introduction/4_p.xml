<p class="p">In contrast, mathematical modeling has been used to predict vector population dynamics based on documented biological processes (rather than vector presence/absence data), the vector's lifecycle, breeding and survival rates, and the influence of external drivers for vector development (

 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>). This vector development mechanism can be parametrized with empirical data from the laboratory or field. Such a mathematical model can be built on collectively gathered empirical evidence to estimate vector proliferation, and then combined with climatic, environmental, and socio-economic factors. By applying such a dynamic system to estimation of vector development and demography, the vector population can be described in spatio-temporal terms.
