<p class="p">In this study we use the same process-based mathematical model to estimate the global distribution and abundance of 
 <italic class="italic">A. aegypti</italic>, in response to climatic variables and socio-economic factors. We validate this model against global vector presence data. Then we project the global distribution, the potential abundance, and the vector density from the past to the future, taking into account either climate as a sole factor or climate and socio-economic factors together. Future climate scenarios are used to project the potential vector abundance to the end of the twenty-first century.
