<p class="p">Although the original vector model has been validated in Campinas, Brazil against vector field data and dengue transmission data over a few decades (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>), the vector field data is always limited and dengue transmission is indirect. Certain assumptions must be taken into account, especially for all the rainfall-dependent parameters, such as carrying capacity, hatching fraction, and mortality rates for underwater stages. In addition, without an egg stage, the fraction of eggs laid were assumed to transfer to the larval population instantaneously, which is unlikely. However, our time span for abundance estimation was at least 6 months after the introduction of the female adults. The transition of eggs to larvae has already occurred to a large extent, if breeding sites were available. According to an egg modeling study by Yang et al. (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>), the eggs of 
 <italic class="italic">A. aegypti</italic> have shown very complicated biological traits in hatching; indeed, eight compartments were used to model hatching alone. Therefore, it is doubtful that a four-stage model including eggs will enhance the results over the three-compartment model used here.
