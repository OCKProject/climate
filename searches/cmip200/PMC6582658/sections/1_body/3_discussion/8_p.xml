<p class="p">Nonetheless, as with all modeling approaches, this study has limitations as well. Two such are the absence of capturing how irrigation, which is used to compensate for low rain levels, can exacerbate vector reproduction, and the use of air conditioning, which can lower vector survival and reproduction. These factors describing local variation are not included in this study on global vector population, although they are important to include for modeling a specific local area, as was done in some prior studies. For example, human-contributed semi-permanent water containers were included in the mathematical modeling for dengue transmission in San Juan, PR (
