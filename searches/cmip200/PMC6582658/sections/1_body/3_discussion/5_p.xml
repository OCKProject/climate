<p class="p">Our study complements the statistical estimates based on presence/absence occurrence data collected from limited monitoring sources (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>). The most comprehensive available source for global distribution of

 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>) for the period 1960â€“2014. All the models show generally similar regions but larger areas of vector presence than the vector surveillance data, especially in Africa and South Asia. This is reasonable, since the occurrence data can easily underestimate many areas of developing countries due to the underreporting of vector presence by deficient surveillance systems. There are considerable gaps in such vector surveillance. The eastern part of South America (e.g., Brazil) and the southern USA show more vector presence data, which may be due to a well-functioning surveillance system in response to frequent dengue or other epidemics, which our model captured. In addition, our model suggests more areas in Africa and Asia that, like Brazil, have even higher vector abundance but were not present in the occurrence data, possibly due to underreporting (
