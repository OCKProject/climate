<p class="p">Our study illustrates not only the global distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">A. aegypti</italic>, but also the relative abundance, both geographically and temporally. Not surprisingly, seasons with the highest vector abundance are summer and fall, and the lowest are spring and winter. Over the past 110 years, the potential for vector abundance based on climate alone is estimated to have increased with about 9.5%. The largest increase (8.2%) has occurred since 1990, which indicates that a possible tipping point was reached in the global abundance of 
 <italic class="italic">A. aegypti</italic>. In the future, as climate is projected to warm further, the potential for global distribution and abundance is also predicted to increase following the temperature trend closely, up to a 20% increase under a low emission future or a 30% increase under a high-emission future resulting in potential substantial changes in the abundance across the globe. Illustrating the effect of climate mitigation, the increase tapers off slowly after 2040 under the low carbon emission scenario, in agreement with the Paris Climate accord, and after 2070 under a high carbon emission scenario.
