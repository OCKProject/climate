<p class="p">This study would have benefited more from vector population data to validate the model estimates, parameters, and to test for other possible relationships between model parameters, such as breeding site and climate/socio-economic variables. However, only very limited vector data from field measurement exist describing larval dynamics on a relative scale. Yang et al. set a fixed number of breeding sites of 1,000,000 for larva carrying capacity of

 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>). Due to a lack of vector population data to validate our model, except for limited vector presence areas, the values in vector abundance may be viewed as a relative measure of potential abundance driven by the factor incorporated in the models, rather than an absolute number.
