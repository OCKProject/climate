<p class="p">The statistical model estimates of global presence of 
 <italic class="italic">A. aegypti</italic> from Kraemer et al. (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>) are very similar to the result from our climate-driven model (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" class="xref">Figure S5A</xref> for comparison). Both used natural environmental factors, with climate as the dominant factor. However, in light of the dispersion of 
 <italic class="italic">Aedes</italic> vectors to new areas through global trade (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>), and the creation of urban breeding sites owing to rapid urbanization and economic development (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>), it is important to include human population and socio-economic factors when estimating the realized occurrence and abundance of the vector.
