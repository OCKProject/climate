<p class="p">This study uses a process-based mathematical vector model based on the lifecycle of 
 <italic class="italic">A. aegypti</italic> to delineate the global distribution of vector potential abundance in space and time. We present two models: Model A postdicts and predicts potential abundance based on climate as the only driving force, and is built on an existing validated model structure (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>) with improvements in model parametrization; Model B tests the sensitivity of the realized abundance of the vector to multiple driving forces consisting of both climate and socio-economic parameters, to account for human and economic influences on vector abundance. Using both models, we estimate vector population dynamics globally and present the change over the last and the current century.
