<p class="p">Our mathematical model tested the sensitivity of the climate-driven potential abundance to the realized global vector population distribution, based on human population and GDPpc. Information on human population was also included in the recent statistical model of global distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">A. aegypti</italic> (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>). We found the socio-economic sensitivity to the abundance to be large, which was also confirmed in the prior study, where it increased the probability of this vector's presence in areas of larger human population such as the coastal areas of the USA, eastern and southern Africa, and southern Asia.
