<p class="p">Based on Model B, we estimated the global 
 <italic class="italic">A. aegypti</italic> annual abundance averaged over two periods, 1951–1970 and 1996–2015, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>. This analysis considers the change in climate, population and GDPpc. Over the 45-year time span, the vector density increased. The area with higher population density of 
 <italic class="italic">A. aegypti</italic> is postdicted to spread from coastal areas toward more continental areas, following patterns of economic activity and higher human population density.
