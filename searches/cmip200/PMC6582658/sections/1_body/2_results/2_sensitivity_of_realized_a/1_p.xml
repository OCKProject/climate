<p class="p">In a second model, using multiple drivers (Model B) we estimated the global distribution of vector population per area due to both climatic and socio-economic influences. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">Figure 5</xref> shows a comparison of different driving forces for the global abundance of female adult 
 <italic class="italic">A. aegypti</italic>, averaged over the past decade. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">Figure 5A</xref> we use only climate as the driving force for vector abundance (per breeding site) using a linear scale. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">Figure 5B</xref> (linear scale) and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">Figure 5C</xref> (log scale) (2006â€“2015) we use climate, human population, and GDPpc as the driving forces. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">Figure 5C</xref> overlays also the occurrence data (
