<p class="p">In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">Figure 5B</xref>, similar to 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">Figure 5A</xref>, the highest vector abundance is observed around the equator, in tropical areas. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">Figure 5B</xref> highlights the more densely populated vector areas with the linear color scale used, and thus emphasizes human influence on vector abundance in urban settings, such as Asia and Africa. The log scale in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">Figure 5C</xref> better illustrates the vector presence areas with low vector density, such as Australia, North Africa, and America. It compares better with the reported occurrence data, the black dots as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">Figure 5C</xref>. The difference between 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">Figures 5A,B</xref> is clearly shown in North Australia and the Amazon area of Brazil, where human population is low but the natural environment is suitable for this vector to flourish.
