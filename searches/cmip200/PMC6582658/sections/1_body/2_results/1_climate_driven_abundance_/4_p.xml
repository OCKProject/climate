<p class="p">Under RCP2.6, compared to under RCP8.5 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Figures 3A,B</xref>) there is a stark contrast in the potential abundance of the vector. The low-emission scenario pathway, RCP2.6, indicates positive changes in Asia such as in China, and central and West Africa, and Latin America, but reductions in India and Australia. The high-emission scenario, RCP8.5, shows big increased potential in Southeast Asia, China, Japan, East Australia, and Africa (with the exception of the Sahel area). In the Americas, the change is the greatest in highly populated areas of Brazil, Mexico and the US, with drops in the abundance potential in central South America, north Africa, southwest Asia, and North Australia.
