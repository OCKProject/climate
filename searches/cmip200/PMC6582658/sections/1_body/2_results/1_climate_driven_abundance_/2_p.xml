<p class="p">Next, we compare the potential for global distribution and abundance of 
 <italic class="italic">A. aegypti</italic> over the past century. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Figure 2</xref> shows the yearly averaged abundance (total female adults per larval site) over the three decades at the beginning of the last century (1902–1931; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Figure 2A</xref>) and at the turn of this century (1987–2016; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Figure 2B</xref>), and the difference between the two (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Figure 2C</xref>). Changes are observed along the tropical belt, and increased potential for abundance (red) is postdicted in Central and South America, especially in Mexico, Cuba, Venezuela and parts of Brazil (north, northeast, southeast coastal states from Rio de Janeiro, San Paulo to Rio Grande do Sul); in central Africa around the Uganda and Kenya area; in South Asia including Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, and the Philippines. Decreased potential for vector abundance is postdicted in only a few areas (green), including scattered small areas in the west and east part of South America, in north Africa, and in a smaller strip from Nepal to the west coast of Myanmar.
