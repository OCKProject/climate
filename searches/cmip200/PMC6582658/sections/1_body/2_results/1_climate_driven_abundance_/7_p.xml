<p class="p">Under the highest carbon emission scenario of RCP8.5, the change in the potential of vector abundance rises another 20% by the 2070s and then slightly decreases. The total change in vector abundance over the two centuries is more than 30%, and the temperature rise is about 5.8°C (1910–2070). The average increase per degree in this scenario is 5.0%. This is less than that under RCP2.6, due to saturation from temperatures that will be over the optimal value for vector development and survival. Therefore, two different future trajectories in the potential of vector abundance are observed under two carbon emission scenarios, with an average of 6.1% increase per degree. The potential abundance follows closely the temperature change for the same period with a correlation coefficient of 0.99 under RCP2.6 and 0.89 under RCP8.5.</p>
