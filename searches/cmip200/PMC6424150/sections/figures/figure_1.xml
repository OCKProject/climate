  <p class="p">Correlation coefficients between ERSST and hindcast indices of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) from 1961 to 2010 in decadal hindcasts made with 
   <bold class="bold">a</bold> CCSM4, 
   <bold class="bold">b</bold> CM2.1, 
   <bold class="bold">c</bold> HadCM3, and 
   <bold class="bold">d</bold> MIROC5 ESMs, and 
   <bold class="bold">e</bold> MME. Color bars show average correlation coefficients at lead times from 0–3 to 6–9 years, calculated with various combinations of averaged ensemble members. Vertical black lines show the range of coefficients for individual combinations of members. Color bar legend is shown. Self denotes correlation coefficients at lead times from 0–3 to 6–9 years, calculated between each ensemble member and the average of the remaining ensemble members for each model
