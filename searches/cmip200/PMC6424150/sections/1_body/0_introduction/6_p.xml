<p id="Par7" class="p">Based on the foregoing rationale, the ability of the CM2.1, HadCM3, MIROC5, and CCSM4 ESMs in CMIP5 to simulate major attributes of the PDO, the TAG variability, and the WPWP variability was described in Mehta et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">2017</xref>). The ability of these four ESMs to hindcast the three DCV phenomena is addressed in the present paper. The scientific objectives of this study are: (1) to assess deterministic and probabilistic skills of these ESMs to hindcast the phases and magnitudes of the three DCV indices; (2) to assess transition probabilities of phases of the PDO, TAG, and WPWP indices, individually as well as in combinations of indices, and compare them with transition probabilities of observed indices; (3) to understand the roles of volcanic eruptions and internal oceanâ€“atmosphere variability in predictability of phase transitions of DCV indices; and (4) to assess the impacts, if any, of initialization on hindcast skill.
