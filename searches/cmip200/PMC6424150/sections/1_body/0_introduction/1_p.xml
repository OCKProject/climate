 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" class="xref">2008</xref>), and their impacts on global climate are attracting increasing attention in predictability and prediction studies because of their impacts on water resources, agriculture, hydro-electricity generation, inland water-borne commerce, and fish and crustacean stocks and captures (Mehta 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">2017</xref>). Analyses of associations between SST indices of these three natural DCV phenomena; and decadal–multidecadal variability of global precipitation, temperatures, and the Palmer Drought Severity Index show that approximately 60–90% variance in these three hydro-meteorological variables on land is explained by the PDO, the TAG SST variability, and the WPWP SST variability (Mehta
