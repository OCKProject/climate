<p id="Par6" class="p">Another reason to evolve different approaches for decadal climate prediction is that, unlike in weather prediction, variations/changes in external or boundary forcings such as solar emissions, volcanic and anthropogenic aerosols, anthropogenic greenhouse gases, and land use—land cover also influence/impact climate at the multiyear to decadal timescales. Since decadal predictions using dynamical models are made as a mixed initial—boundary value problem, contributions of both model initialization and external/boundary forcings in decadal prediction skill should be evaluated. Therefore, comparison of initialized predictions with uninitialized simulations with the same ESMs is very important.</p>
