<p id="Par8" class="p">These four ESMs were selected for both studies because it is important to assess simulation and hindcast skills of the same ESMs in the same experimental framework. The modeling groups who have developed these four ESMs conducted CMIP5 simulation and hindcast/forecast experiments with generally the same model configurations. Also, decadal hindcast/forecast experiments with these four ESMs were run in CMIP5 in the ensemble mode with up to 10 members in each ensemble.</p>
