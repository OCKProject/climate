 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">2011a</xref>): (1) relatively short time series of instrument-based global ocean observations, especially sub-surface observations, for understanding, model initialization, and comparison with prediction; (2) an insufficient understanding of fundamental physics of DCV; (3) an insufficient theoretical understanding of possible behaviors of geographically-varying, complex and non-linear dynamical systems with mixed initial and boundary values; (4) global climate models displaying less than satisfactory skill in simulating climate in general and DCV in particular; and (5) insufficient guidance from stakeholders and policymakers as to which DCV-related climate, weather, and impacts information would be useful for applications to societal impacts of DCV if predicted. In spite of these problems, however, there have been many encouraging decadal prediction studies with global earth system models (ESMs). In these pioneering studies, ESMs were initialized from observed data, and natural and anthropogenic changes in aerosol optical depth (AOD) were prescribed from observations-based estimates (or scenarios). Smith et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">2007</xref>) showed that skillful decadal prediction of global-average temperature may be possible. Keenlyside et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">2008</xref>) and Pohlmann et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">2009</xref>) showed that skillful prediction of decadal, North Atlantic SSTs may be possible. Building on these studies, Yang et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" class="xref">2012</xref>) found that an inter-hemispheric, multidecadal SST pattern in the Atlantic may be predictable 4 to 10Â years in advance. Meehl et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">2014</xref>) have described results from hitherto published CMIP5 and other decadal hindcasting experiments, so only major results pertaining to predictability of indices of decadal SST variability are reviewed here.
