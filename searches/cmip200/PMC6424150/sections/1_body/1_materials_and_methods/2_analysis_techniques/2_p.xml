<p id="Par13" class="p">For each individual hindcast run of each ESM, a monthly SST anomaly was defined as the departure from its corresponding monthly SST climatology. It is well recognized that ESMs suffer mean biases that are significantly lead-time dependent. To avoid such model drift, the model monthly SST climatology was constructed for each lead time. The hindcast monthly SST anomalies were then derived by subtracting the monthly SST climatology with the same lead time as the hindcast SST.</p>
