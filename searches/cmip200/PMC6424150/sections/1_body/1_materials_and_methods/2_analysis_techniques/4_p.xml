<p id="Par15" class="p">We also estimated the dependence of hindcast skill on the number of ensemble members averaged at various lead times and compared this estimate with an ESM’s ability to predict its own ensemble-average at the same lead times. The former can be called the signal skill and the latter can be called the noise skill. The signal skill’s evolution with respect to the number of ensemble members averaged indicates when (in terms of number of members) the signal skill saturates and a comparison of the two types of skills can be used as an indicator of model performance. In all deterministic skill estimates, following Kim et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">2012</xref>), we used 4-year running windows of observed and hindcast indices to increase the number of samples in each correlation estimates. The t-test (Press et al.
