<p id="Par12" class="p">We calculated the PDO index from each decadal hindcast experiment by projecting hindcast SSTs from each ESM on the PDO patterns isolated from simulation runs with that ESM (Mehta et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">2017</xref>) to quantify the evolution of the PDO patterns during each 10-year hindcast period. The assumption was that the basic character of the PDO patterns is generally the same in simulation and hindcast experiments conducted with a particular ESM. The TAG and WPWP indices were calculated directly from the hindcast SSTs. These SST indices were calculated by averaging SST anomalies in the WPWP region (20°S to 20°N, 90°E to 180°) for the WPWP index, and in the tropical North (5° to 20°N, 30° to 60°W) and South (0° to 20°S, 30°W to 10°E) Atlantic to calculate the difference between the two to define the TAG index. As mentioned in Mehta et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">2017</xref>), the WPWP SST index has a substantial warming trend. The present analyses were conducted both with and without the warming trend.
