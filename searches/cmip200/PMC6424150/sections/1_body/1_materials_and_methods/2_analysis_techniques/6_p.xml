<p id="Par17" class="p">In another estimate of probabilistic skill estimate, we calculated probabilities of transition of a DCV index from one phase to another phase (for example, from positive phase PDO
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> to negative phase PDO
 <sup class="sup">−</sup>) by counting the number of times each phase transition occurred in a given seasonal or annual index time series and then by expressing the number as a percentage of the total number of data points in the index time series. The same approach was followed in calculating transition probabilities of simultaneous phases of more than one DCV phenomena [for example, from the (PDO
 <sup class="sup">+</sup>, TAG
 <sup class="sup">+</sup>) combination to the (PDO
 <sup class="sup">+</sup>, TAG
 <sup class="sup">−</sup>) combination]. For the purpose of assessing hindcast skill of magnitudes of DCV indices, following the definitions of Niño3.4 phases [see, for example, Trenberth (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">1997</xref>)], we defined three states of each index—largest negative value to − ½ times standard deviation (negative), − ½ times standard deviation to + ½ times standard deviation (neutral), and greater than +½ times standard deviation (positive). All index time series were normalized by subtracting the long-term average annual cycle and dividing by standard deviation of the time series.
