 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">2016</xref>) used the ROC as a probabilistic indicator of skill of CMIP5 models to discriminate between El Niño and La Niña events. The ROC score is relatively independent of forecast initialization; that is, forecast probability and observed relative frequency are independent. Any two forecasts having the same probability ratios, regardless of magnitude, will result in the same ROC score, so the score represents the potential rather than actual predictability. Forecasts having good discriminative ability will show high ROC scores regardless of whether or not probability values are well calibrated. In this paper, the ROC score is shown as the area under the ROC curve (AUC) which is a physical representation of the comparison between the hit rate and false-alarm rate of a set of probabilistic forecasts. The AUC represents the discrimination skill of a set of forecasts with scores above 0.5 indicating potential discrimination skill and a score of 1.0 indicating perfect potential discrimination skill.
