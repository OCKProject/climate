 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">2016</xref>). The skill estimates were calculated with the ensemble-average data as well as data from individual ensemble members from each ESM, and also data from the MME. The individual member skill estimates were used to mark ranges of spread around the skill of ensemble-average hindcasts.
