<p id="Par9" class="p">Two sets of core decadal prediction experiments were conducted under CMIP5 (Taylor et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">2012</xref>). The first set was a series of 10-year hindcasts starting approximately in 1960, 1970, 1980, 1990, and 2000. The second was a series of 30-year hindcasts starting in 1960, 1980, and 2005, the last a combined hindcast-forecast. In both sets, AODs (including those due to volcanic eruptions) and solar radiation were prescribed from past observations. Each experiment had a minimum ensemble size of three members. These experiments were somewhat idealistic and exploratory, especially in view of the well-known difficulty of predicting volcanic eruptions.
