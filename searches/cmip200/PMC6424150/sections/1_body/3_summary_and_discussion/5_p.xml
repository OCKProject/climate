<p id="Par70" class="p">Although it is (almost) impossible to predict volcanic eruptions of any explosivity, it is instructive that AOD changes associated with major volcanic eruptions were included in the CMIP5 hindcast experiments. As the results show, the four ESMs and the MME appear to respond accurately to varying degrees to the eruption-associated AOD changes, and the hindcasts of the PDO and WPWP indices show phase transitions and subsequent evolutions of the DCV indices comparable to those in observed indices for several months to several years in some cases. Therefore, these hindcast results give encouragement for the use of these and other ESMs for multi-year prediction initialized soon after a major volcanic eruption occurs. Volcanic AOD changes appear to cause damped oscillations in the DCV indices in some cases over several years, which might extend predictability of these indices beyond the immediate effects of AOD changes. These impacts of eruption-associated AOD changes on DCV indices imply that volcanic eruptions can influence global atmospheric dynamics and climate not only directly via interactions between ejected material in the atmosphere and short- and long-wave radiations, but also via influencing DCV phenomenaâ€™s impacts on global climate.</p>
