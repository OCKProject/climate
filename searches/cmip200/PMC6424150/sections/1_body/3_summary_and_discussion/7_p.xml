<p id="Par72" class="p">Also enigmatic are the differences in behaviors of this group of ESMs in simulation and prediction modes. Simulations of the three DCV phenomena with the same ESMs and the MME (Mehta et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">2017</xref>) show that while these ESMs simulate the PDO’s attributes (spatial pattern, annual cycle, and variability timescales) reasonably well, the ESMs only simulate the annual cycle and variability timescales of the WPWP SST variability reasonably well and the WPWP’s spatial pattern is very poorly simulated by the ESMs and the MME. In the case of the TAG SST variability, simulation results show that while the spatial pattern simulation by the ESMs and the MME is approximately correct, the annual cycle and variability timescales are simulated very poorly. As results presented in this paper show, however, the WPWP index has the best deterministic and probabilistic hindcast skills, only MIROC5 shows reasonably high hindcast skills of the PDO index, and all of the ESMs show poor TAG hindcast skills. These differences between simulations and predictions of the same phenomenon by the same ESMs have serious implications not only for the prediction of impacts of these phenomena on global climate and society, but also about the simulation and prediction/projection of future climate change and its impacts. This is especially true about the WPWP since it is the largest heat source for driving global atmospheric circulations. Despite these problems, as the encouraging results in this and other cited papers indicate, the day may not be very far in the future when some aspects of DCV information are skillfully predicted and routinely used in agriculture and water resource managements, and other societal sectors.
