<p id="Par61" class="p">We estimated deterministic and probabilistic hindcast skills of the PDO, the TAG SST variability, and the WPWP SST variability in ensembles of decadal hindcasts made with the CCSM4, CM2.1, HadCM3, and MIROC5 ESMs—and the MME formed from these ESM hindcasts—from 1961 to 2010. We also estimated positive and negative phase occurrence rates, phase transition probabilities, and one-year and two-year phase predictability. We then conducted case studies of individual, sustained phase transitions in the ensembles of decadal hindcasts in order to attribute the transitions to volcanic eruptions or internal ocean–atmosphere variability. We found that:</p>
