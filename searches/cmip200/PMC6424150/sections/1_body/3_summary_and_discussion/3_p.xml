<p id="Par68" class="p">Before these results are discussed further, it must be mentioned that there are several shortcomings of these ESMs and decadal hindcast/forecast experiments conducted with them as mentioned in Sect.Â 
 <xref rid="Sec1" ref-type="sec" class="xref">1.2</xref>. Additionally, the four ESMs selected for the present study were initialized with different techniques. In spite of these and other shortcomings such as the inclusion of future volcanic eruptions in decadal hindcasts, the results of the analyses presented in this paper shed considerable light on prospects for future predictions of DCV indices and their usability for impacts prediction.
