<p id="Par71" class="p">This surprising ability of this group of ESMs to hindcast an observed DCV index better than their ability to hindcast their own index at various lead times is truly enigmatic and further research is necessary to understand causes and implications of such model behavior. Such enigmatic behavior of signal and noise skills for the TAG index, and non-response of TAG hindcasts to major volcanic eruptions are consistent with a similar behavior of a global atmospheric model to predict the North Atlantic Oscillation index in response to observed SSTs (Mehta et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">2000</xref>), indicating that there is something fundamentally incorrect about the Atlantic regionâ€™s responses to internal and external forcings in atmosphere-alone and coupled Earth System models.
