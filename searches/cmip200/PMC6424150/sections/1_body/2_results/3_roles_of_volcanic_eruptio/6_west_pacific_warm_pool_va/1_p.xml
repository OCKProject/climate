<p id="Par60" class="p">There were 9 phase transitions in the WPWP SST index from 1961 to 2010 in the observed data, with each phase persisting for many months to many years. As in the cases of PDO and TAG phase transitions, there are two types of transitions in WPWP index; one group associated with internal ocean–atmosphere dynamics and the other associated with AOD changes associated with volcanic eruptions. From these visual inspections and a comparison with simulations by these four ESMs (Mehta et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">2017</xref>), summary answers to the questions posed are: (1) There are four phase transitions associated with the four major volcanic eruptions in the observed WPWP index which were generally correctly hindcast by the four ESMs and the MME; (2) all ESMs’ ensemble-average hindcasts capture transitions not associated with volcanic eruptions in 1993–1994 and 1994–1996 to varying degrees; (3) simulations with all four ESMs and the MME capture the 1963–1964, 1981–1982, and 1991–1993 phase transitions associated with volcanic eruptions in the WPWP SST index. Simulations with MIROC5 and HadCM3 also capture the 1973–1976 phase transition; ranges of simulated transitions, however, vary among the ESMs and the MME; (4) The impact of initialization appears to reinforce the four transitions associated with volcanic eruptions and correct hindcasts of two additional transitions not associated with volcanic eruptions. The latter two, however, are also present in simulations with all four ESMs and the MME, so perhaps there is another radiative forcing (not AOD changes) driving these two transitions. It is also interesting to note that simulations show warming trend in the WPWP SST index continuing after 1996 which is not captured by any of the ESMs’ hindcasts; and (5) a correct simulation of the WPWP index’s response to volcanic eruptions appears to be a pre-requisite to correct hindcasts in response to the same events.
