<p id="Par58" class="p">There were 14 PDO phase transitions between 1961 and 2010 in the observed data, with each phase persisting for many months to many years. There were two types of phase transitions in the observed PDO index—transitions associated with internal ocean–atmosphere dynamics and those associated with AOD changes associated with volcanic eruptions. From these visual inspections, summary answers to the questions posed are: (1) Three PDO phase transitions are associated with volcanic eruptions in both observed and hindcast indices in all ESMs and the MME (Mount Agung, Volcan de Fuego, Mount Pinatubo), except for the absence of the Volcan de Fuego transition in CCSM4; (2) All ESMs’ hindcasts capture phase transitions not associated with AOD changes in varying numbers, such correct transitions in an ESM’s hindcast vary from two to six; (3) The Mount Agung and Mount Pinatubo transitions are in simulations with all four ESMs and the MME also, but the sizes of the simulated changes vary among the ESMs and the MME (Mehta et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">2017</xref>); (4) The 1976–1977 NTP transition is simulated by CM2.1, HadCM3, and CCSM4 to some extent, which suggests the intriguing possibility that perhaps coupled ocean–atmosphere response to the 1974–1975 Volcan de Fuego volcanic eruption resulted in the 1976–1977 NTP transition; this transition is present, but without the full range of PDO index change, only in ensemble-average hindcasts by CM2.1 and the MME initialized in 1970. Thus, initialization appears to have interfered with this NTP transition in HadCM3 and CCSM4 ESMs if indeed it was caused as a response to the Volcan de Fuego eruption; and (5) a correctly simulated response to AOD changes associated with volcanic eruptions does not appear to be a pre-requisite for an ESM to successfully hindcast the PDO response to the same forcing change.
