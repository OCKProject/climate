<p id="Par59" class="p">There were 9 TAG phase transitions between 1961 and 2010 in the observed data, each of which persisted in positive or negative phase for many months to many years. From visual inspections, summary answers to the questions posed are: (1) There are no TAG phase transitions in hindcast data which are also in observed data and are associated with AOD changes; (2) There are no TAG phase transitions in hindcast data which are also in observed data, but are not associated with AOD changes; (3) some of the TAG phase transitions which are in observed data are simulated by some of the ESMs and the MME, but they are not hindcast by any ESM; (4) initialization appears to have interfered with the ESMs’ hindcasting the correct response to major volcanic eruptions; and (5) since no TAG phase transition is hindcast by any of the ESMs, its correct simulation by the same ESM does not appear to be important. With respect to a lack of the TAG index’s response to volcanic eruptions in these ESMs, it is possible, as Swingedouw et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">2015</xref>) found, that the response of some ESMs to Mount Agung-like, low-latitude volcanic eruptions on North Atlantic Ocean circulation and temperature is delayed by several years to a decade. Therefore, the response of the Atlantic climate in general and the TAG phenomenon in particular in these ESMs to low-latitude volcanic eruptions in the simulation and hindcast modes needs to be studied further via controlled experimentation with these ESMs.
