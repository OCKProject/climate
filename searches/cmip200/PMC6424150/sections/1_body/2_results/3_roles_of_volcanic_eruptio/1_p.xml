<p id="Par50" class="p">Sustained transitions in phases of the PDO, and the TAG and WPWP SST variabilities in observed and ensemble-average hindcast indices were visually identified. The phase transitions occurred over many months to 1 to 3 years and there is some subjectivity in the choice of selected transitions. The observed and hindcast phase transitions were also compared with major volcanic eruptions at low latitudes as represented in AOD time series and other publicly available information. Major eruptions are defined here as Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI; Newhall and Self

There were four such low-latitude eruptions in the 1961 to 2010 period: (1) February to May 1963, Mount Agung, Bali, Indonesia, VEI 5; (2) October 1974 to early 1975, Volcan de Fuego, Guatemala, VEI 4; (3) March to April 1982, El Chichón, Mexico, VEI 5; and (4) June 1991, Mount Pinatubo, Philippines, VEI 6. The following questions were addressed to visually identify roles of volcanic eruptions and internal variability in DCV phase transitions.
