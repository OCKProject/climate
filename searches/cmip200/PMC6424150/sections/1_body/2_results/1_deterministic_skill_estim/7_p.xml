<p id="Par24" class="p">The lead time dependence of correlation coefficients for the TAG index (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>) is model-dependent, with the coefficients increasing with lead time in CCSM4, and peaking in the 2 to 8 years lead time range in the other three models and the MME. They all, however, share the characteristic that the skills increase with increasing numbers of ensemble members averaged with the highest skills close to 0.8 in CM2.1, HadCM3, and the MME. They all also share the characteristic that ranges of coefficients decrease with increasing numbers of ensemble members averaged as the vertical black lines show. Each model’s ability to predict its own TAG index varies with model and lead time, and these self-correlations are generally less than or equal to those for the observed TAG index.
