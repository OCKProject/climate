 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>, and 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> show that ranges of correlation coefficients decrease as larger numbers of ensemble members are averaged to correlate with observed indices and an increasing amount of internal noise is averaged out. It is also evident in these Figures that the skills of ensemble-average hindcasts saturate after 6 to 7 members are averaged. An analysis of the signal skills and noise skills of all ESMs and the MME for all indices shows that if the former skills are larger than the latter skills, the overall hindcast skill is higher. For the PDO index, only the MIROC5 hindcasts show larger signal skill than noise skill in the first few years after initialization. Hindcasts by the other three ESMs and the MME show higher noise skill compared to signal skill in the first few years. For the TAG index, hindcasts by all four ESMs and the MME show higher noise skills than signal skills in the first few years. For both the detrended and non-detrended WPWP indices, hindcasts by all four ESMs and the MME show higher signal skills than noise skills in the first few years, with the result that hindcasts by all ESMs and the MME have high skills for long lead times.
