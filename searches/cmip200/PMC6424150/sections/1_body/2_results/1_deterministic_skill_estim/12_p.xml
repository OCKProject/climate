<p id="Par29" class="p">In Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>, the observed and ensemble-average hindcast PDO (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>a, b) and TAG (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>c, d) correlation coefficients are conspicuous by their inclination to peak in the middle or towards the end of the 10 years hindcast runs. This is particularly obvious for the CM2.1, HadCM3, and MME hindcasts of the TAG index at 2 to 7 years lead times, some of which are significant at the 95% or higher level. It is also interesting to note that almost all ESM hindcasts have higher skills than persistence at 2 years and longer lead times even though some of the ESM hindcast skills are not statistically significant. This behavior of the ESMs is seen in the PDO hindcasts (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>a) at 4 years and longer lead times. The MIROC5 hindcasts of PDO, however, display a more conventional dependence on lead time – largest correlation coefficients at 1 to 4 years lead times and then decreasing with increasing lead time—as Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>a shows. Ranges of correlation coefficients between observed indices and individual ensemble members are very large as Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>a, c show for the PDO and the TAG, respectively. The RMSEs in both PDO (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>b) and TAG (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>d) hindcasts are generally smallest at lead times when respective correlation coefficients are largest. As for the correlation coefficients, however, ranges of errors are very large in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>b, d. Compared to the PDO and TAG hindcast skills, the detrended WPWP index hindcast skill (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>e) presents a much more conventional dependence on lead times such that the correlation coefficients are largest and larger than persistence skill from initialization to 5 years lead times, and then decrease to zero and below. Corresponding RMSEs of the detrended WPWP index hindcasts (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>f) are generally smallest when correlations are largest and then increase as the correlations decrease. Ranges of correlation coefficients and RMSEs for the WPWP index are generally smaller when correlation coefficients are largest, especially at lead times closer to initialization. This more conventional presentation of deterministic skill confirms the conclusions drawn from the comparison of signal and noise skills earlier in this Section; that is, MIROC5 has the best hindcast skill among the four ESMs for the PDO index, no one of the ESMs and the MME has TAG hindcast skills, and all four ESMs and the MME have moderate to high hindcast skills for detrended and non-detrended WPWP indices.
