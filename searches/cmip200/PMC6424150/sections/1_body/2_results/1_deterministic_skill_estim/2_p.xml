 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>, and 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> show the two groups of correlation coefficients for the PDO, the TAG, detrended WPWP, and non-detrended WPWP indices, respectively. Within each Figure, results for each ESM and the MME are shown in individual panels. Each color bar shows the average of correlation coefficients between an observed index and average index of all unique combinations of ensemble members for one lead time; the black vertical line on each color bar shows the range of minimum and maximum coefficients within an ensemble. Each group of seven bars shows coefficients for each number of ensemble members averaged for seven lead times. The last group, labeled Self, shows correlation coefficients between each ensemble member and the average of the remaining ensemble members. The legend at the bottom of each Figure indicates the lead time in years after initialization of each 10-year hindcast. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> shows a counter-intuitive progression from no skill to some skill (corr. coeff. 0.5) of PDO prediction in CCSM4 and HadCM3 hindcasts as lead time increases. CM2.1 has no skill at any lead time. MIROC5 shows an increase of skill in the first 4 years after initialization with increasing averaging of ensemble members, with the correlation coefficient reaching almost 1.0 after averaging four ensemble members. The MME correlation coefficients generally shows skill increasing with lead time as in CCSM4 and HadCM3. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> also shows for all models and the MME decreasing ranges of correlation coefficients between averaged ensemble members and the observed PDO index with increasing numbers of ensemble members. Finally, each model’s ability to predict its own PDO index shows the highest correlation coefficients at the 0–3 years’ lead time for all models except MIROC5 which shows highest correlation coefficient at the 1–4 years’ lead time. These highest self-correlations near the beginning of hindcast runs appear to be consistent with initialization of all ensemble members of a particular model with the same SST data. For each model, the comparison between external index prediction skill and internal index prediction skill is variable. MIROC5 shows a paradoxical behavior as it appears to have a higher skill in predicting observed PDO index compared to the skill in predicting its own ensemble-average PDO index.
