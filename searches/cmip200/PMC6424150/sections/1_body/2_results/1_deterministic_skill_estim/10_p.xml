 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>a, c, e show correlation coefficients between the observed DCV index and the ensemble-average hindcast index from each ESM and the MME; ranges of correlation coefficients between the observed index and index from each ensemble member are shown as vertical black lines on each color bar. The ESM associated with each color bar is identified in Fig.

 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>a, c, e denote 95 and 99% confidence thresholds, respectively. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>b, d, f show RMSEs of hindcasts, where the color bars show the errors in ensemble-average and vertical black lines show ranges of errors in ensemble members.
