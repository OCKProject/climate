<p id="Par25" class="p">Determinsitic skill dependence of these four ESMs and the MME on lead time for the detrended WPWP index (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>) is typical of SST index predictability studies [see, for example, Niño3.4 deterministic skill curve in Fig. 6a in Gonzalez and Goddard (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">2016</xref>)]. For all ESMs and the MME in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>, correlation coefficients between hindcast and observed indices are maximum in the first few years and then decrease as lead time increases. Also, in all ESMs, correlation coefficients increase with increasing numbers of ensemble members averaged, reaching saturation after 4 or 5 members are averaged. The characteristic apparent for the PDO and TAG indices of decreasing ranges of correlations with increasing numbers of ensemble members averaged is also seen in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> for the detrended WPWP index. Each model’s ability to predict its own detrended WPWP index, as indicated by the self-correlations, is generally less than or equal to that for the observed detrended WPWP index. In the determinstic skill estimate for the non-detrended WPWP index (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>), the warming trend overwhelms interannual to decadal variability and the correlation coefficients between observed and hindcast indices are higher than 0.6 to 0.8 in all ESMs and the MME for all lead times. There is a very small decrease in coefficients with increasing lead time in CM2.1, HadCM3, MIROC5, and the MME. Each model’s ability to predict its own WPWP index is also very high as Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> shows, but it is intriguing to note that these self-correlations are substantially smaller at 0 to 3 years lead times.
