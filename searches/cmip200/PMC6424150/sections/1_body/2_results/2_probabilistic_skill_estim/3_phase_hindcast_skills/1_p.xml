 <xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec" class="xref">2.1</xref>, the decadal hindcast experiments were initialized once (in the 0th year—1960, 1970, etc.) every 10 years. The phase hindcast skills for the PDO, TAG, and the WPWP indices in the first and second year after initialization are described here. For both the first and second years, we analyzed the accuracy of phase hindcast using data from annual-average and ensemble-average hindcasts as well as from all individual members of each ensemble. The results for both first and second years are shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref> for the PDO. The ensemble averages from the ESMs and the MME hindcast the PDO phase in the first year after initialization correctly in all five decades, except for CM2.1 in 1961. The second year phase hindcast by ensemble averages was correct for three ESMs (CCSM4, CM2.1, and MIROC5) and the MME in 1982. In other decades, however, fewer ensemble averages from individual ESMs hindcast the PDO phase correctly. The ensemble-average MME hindcast of the PDO phase in the second year was correct in 1982, 1992, and 2002. Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref> also shows that first year phase hindcasts of the PDO index by individual members of each ensemble were correct for the largest number of members of CCSM4 ensembles in all five decades, followed by MIROC5 and the MME. It is obvious that the success rate or skill of phase prediction decreases from first year to second year for CCSM4, CM2.1, and HadCM3, but the second-year phase prediction skill of MIROC5 hindcasts is 100% in four of the five decades. It is also interesting to note that a correct hindcast of first-year PDO phase appears to be a necessary but not a sufficient condition for a correct hindcast of second-year phase.
