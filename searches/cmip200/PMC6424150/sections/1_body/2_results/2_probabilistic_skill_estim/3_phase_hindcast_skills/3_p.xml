<p id="Par47" class="p">As for the PDO index, MIROC5 performs better than the other three ESMs and the MME for the second year prediction of the TAG index also (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>) with correct phase prediction in four out of five decades. CCSM4, CM2.1, and the MME are next with three correct predictions of second-year TAG phase out of five decades, and HadCM3 has correct prediction of second-year phase in two out of five decades. Unlike for PDO predictions, however, a correct first-year prediction of the TAG phase does not appear to be a necessary condition for a correct second-year phase prediction. Of the three DCV indices, first- and second-year hindcasts of the detrended WPWP index are correct in the majority of the ESM-decade combinations (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" class="xref">5</xref>). In 1961, 1981, and 2001, ensemble-average WPWP index hindcasts by all four ESMs and the MME are correct for the first year after initialization. In 1962, 1992, and 2002, second-year phase hindcasts are also correctly made by ensemble-average WPWP indices by all four ESMs and the MME. It is also remarkable that when the first/second year phase of the WPWP index is correctly hindcast by the ESMs and the MME, almost all members of the corresponding ensembles also hindcast the phase correctly.
