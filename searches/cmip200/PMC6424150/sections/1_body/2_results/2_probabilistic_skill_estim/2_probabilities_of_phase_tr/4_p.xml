 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">2017</xref>). Therefore, it is important to estimate predictability of these phase combinations and their transitions to other combinations. There are eight such combinations (2 phases and 3 DCV indices; 2
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> = 8) and the theoretical occurrence rate for each phase combination of the three DCV phenomena would be 12.5% if probabilities of all combinations were equal and if the data time series are sufficiently long. These eight combinations are (PDO

 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref> shows that the occurrence rates of individual and multiple DCV phases in observed data and ensemble-average ESM hindcasts were generally similar, establishing that the ESM hindcasts represent combinations of DCV phases reasonably well.
