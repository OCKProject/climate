<p id="Par40" class="p">Next, the probabilities of transition from the phase in one year to either of the two possible phases of individual DCV indices in the next year in the observed and hindcast annual data were estimated and are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref>. Ranges of within-ensemble transition probabilities in the ESM hindcasts are also shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref> as vertical black line on each color bar. These ranges were calculated from individual ensemble members for each ESM and the MME. For the PDO phases (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref>a), there is an overwhelming tendency for same-phase transitions, or persistance, of PDO from one year to the next. Ensemble-average hindcasts by all ESMs and the MME generally show this tendency in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref>a. Even including the ranges of probabilities for each ESM in the comparison, the higher probabilities of same-phase transitions are clearly evident. There are some seasonal variations in probabilities in the observed, ESM, and MME data, with the same-phase PDO transitions most probable in June–July–August.
