<p id="Par43" class="p">Next, we consider transition probabilities among combinations of phase of two DCV phenomena, the PDO and TAG variability. There are four possible combinations of phenomena and phases—(P
 <sup class="sup">+</sup>, T
 <sup class="sup">+</sup>), (P
 <sup class="sup">−</sup>, T
 <sup class="sup">−</sup>), (P
 <sup class="sup">+</sup>, T
 <sup class="sup">−</sup>), and (P
 <sup class="sup">−</sup>, T
 <sup class="sup">+</sup>)—and the theoretical transition probability for each transition would be 25% if the transitions occur randomly; that is, there would be equal probabilities of a transition to any of the four combinations. The actual transition probabilities of combined PDO and TAG phases are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9</xref> as four color bars, one for each phase combination, for observed and ESM—including MME—data sets. Ranges of within-ensemble transition probabilities in the ESM hindcasts are also shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9</xref> as vertical black lines superimposed on each color bar. A general tendency of all four combinations in the observed and ensemble-average ESM and MME indices to remain in the same combination is obvious in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9</xref>, including when the ranges of ensemble member results are included, although there are cases in which probabilities are higher for transitions to other combinations (for example, (P
 <sup class="sup">+</sup>, T
 <sup class="sup">+</sup>) in CM2.1 and HadCM3). This general observation implies that ensemble-average results may be reliable enough for actual prediction of phase combinations at one to two years lead times. Details show, however, that there are very large ranges of transition probabilities for some combinations, pointing to the need for ensembles and ensemble averaging, including MME averaging.
