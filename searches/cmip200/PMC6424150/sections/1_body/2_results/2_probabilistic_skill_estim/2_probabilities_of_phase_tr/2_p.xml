<p id="Par37" class="p">The occurrences of each phase, as percent of total number of years, are shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref> for annual observed DCV indices from 1961 to 2010. Occurrences of individual phases and combinations of phases in ensemble-average indices and the range (minimum to maximum within an ensemble) of occurrences within each ensemble of the four ESMs for the 1961 to 2010 period are also shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>. If it is assumed that both phases of a DCV index over a multidecadal period have equal probabilities of occurring, then the average occurrence of each phase would be 50% of the period. As Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref> shows, the occurrence rate is almost 50% for the observed PDO, TAG, and WPWP indices, with small departures from the expected occurrence attributable perhaps to a relatively small sample size. Phase occurrences in three-month average index (December–January–February, DJF; March–April–May, MAM; June–July–August, JJA; September–October–November, SON) data are generally similar (not shown). The corresponding occurrence rates for the ESM hindcast data in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref> show that ensemble hindcasts of the three DCV indices have generally comparable occurrence rates with respect to the observed occurrence rates. Ranges of occurrence rates for each ESM’s hindcast ensemble straddle the corresponding ensemble-averages in all except two cases (PDO
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> and PDO
 <sup class="sup">−</sup>) in MIROC5 hindcasts. Thus, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref> shows that all four ESMs hindcast individual DCV phase occurrence rates reasonably accurately.
