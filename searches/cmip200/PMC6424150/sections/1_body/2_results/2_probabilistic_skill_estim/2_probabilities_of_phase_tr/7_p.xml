 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref>b shows that TAG phases are less persistent than PDO phases in observed data and their transition probabilities are approximately equal, although same-phase transitions have higher probabilities. TAG phases in the four ESMs and the MME are more persistent as indicated by considerably larger same-phase transition probabilities for annual data in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref>b. Consequently, opposite-phase transition probabilities are much lower in the individual ESM and MME hindcasts. As for the PDO and TAG phases, same-phase transition probabilities of WPWP phases in the observed annual data (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref>c) are much higher compared to the opposite phase transition probabilities. The same-phase transition probabilities in ensemble-average annual data from the four ESMs and the MME (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref>c) are at least as high as the probabilities in the observed data even when the within-ensemble ranges are included in the comparison. Consequently, opposite phase transition probabilities in the four ESMs and the MME are equal to or lower than those in the observed data. Thus, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref> shows that probabilities of same-phase transitions from one year to the next are considerably larger than opposite-phase transitions for PDO and WPWP phases in observed data and ensemble-average ESM and the MME hindcasts, except in the CM2.1 hindcasts where the differences among probabilities of PDO phase transitions are much smaller. Probabilities for TAG phases are almost the same in the observed data, but in the ensemble-average ESM and MME hindcasts the same-phase transition probabilities are much larger than the opposite-phase probabilities.
