<p id="Par36" class="p">In the second type of estimates of probabilistic hindcast skill, we begin with statistics of occurrence of each DCV phase and of combinations of phases of three DCV phenomena in observed and hindcast DCV indices. Then, observed and hindcast probabilities of transition between positive and negative phases of each DCV phenomenon, and among combinations of phases of three DCV phenomena are described.</p>
