<p id="Par35" class="p">The ensemble-average PDO index AUCs for positive and negative phases (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>a, b) show no discrimination skill in many of the initial lead years, but show an increase in discrimination skill as the lead years increase for positive (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>a) and negative (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>b) phases. After year 5, however, the MME shows positive discrimination skill for positive PDO phase as do CCSM4 and CM2.1 after year 6 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>a). The MME and all ESMs except CM2.1 show very high discrimination skill for negative PDO phase after years 6–7 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>b). Thus, there are substantial differences in discimination skills for positive and negative PDO phases. For the TAG index (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>c, d), except in CCSM4 and the MME, there is no discrimination skill for positive phase in the initialization year 0. All four ESMs and the MME show discrimination skill for positive phase in year 1. There is no discrimination in any of the ESMs in year 2, but some or all of the ESMs show moderate to high discrimination skills in the majority of subsequent lead years for positive phase. For negative TAG phase also, there is no discrimination skill in the initialization year in any ESM and the MME, but then the skill increases in subsequent years except in years 6 and 9. Thus, the discrimination skill dependence on lead time is different for positive and negative TAG phases. All four ESMs and the MME show moderate to high discrimination skills for positive phase of the detrended WPWP index (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>e) from the initialization year to year 4. Then, there is no skill for the next 3 years and the skill increases again in years 8 and 9. For negative phase (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>f), discrimination skill is high initially, then decreasing in years 3, 4, 5, increasing again in year 6, and then finally declining to no skill. For all three indices, there are several ensemble members from each ESM which have very high discrimination skill for positive and negative phases as Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref> shows.
