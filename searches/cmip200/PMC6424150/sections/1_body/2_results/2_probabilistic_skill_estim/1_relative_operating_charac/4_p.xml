<p id="Par33" class="p">We also estimated probabilistic skills to disciminate among three phases of each DCV index. AUC was calculated for positive (greater than or equal to ½ standard deviation above zero), neutral (between − ½ and ½ standard deviations around zero), and negative (less than or equal to − ½ standard deviation below zero) phases for ensemble-average as well as individual member hindcasts. As found by Gonzalez and Goddard (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">2016</xref>) for discrimination skills among three Niño3.4 phases, AUC for the neutral phase of the PDO, TAG, and WPWP indices showed the least amount of potential positive discrimination skill, therefore only the AUCs for discrimination between positive and negative phases are shown here in Fig.
