<p id="Par31" class="p">At any given lead time, one member within an ESM ensemble may have larger discrimination ability then another member in the same ensemble. Therefore, using each ESM’s ensemble average provides the most reliable hindcast skill estimate for that ESM. Similarly, each ESM’s ensemble average can have higher discrimination skill at any given lead time than another ESM’s ensemble average, therefore, the use of the average of the all ESMs’ ensemble averages, the MME, provides the most reliable indicator of discrimination between or among phases/states. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref> shows the ensemble-average as well as individual ensemble member AUC by lead time in years for positive (above 0) and negative (below 0) phases of each DCV index. For the PDO in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>a, there is positive discrimination in lead year 0 and, as the lead years increase, there is an increase in potential positive discrimination from year 6 to year 9. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>b shows the AUC for the TAG index for lead times from 0 to 9 years. There is clear discrimination skill for the majority of the lead times except 0 to 2 years. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>c shows the AUC for the detrended WPWP index which shows a more conventional dependence of discrimination skill on lead time, with larger discrimination found in years 0 to 2 and the positive discrimination decreasing with the increase of lead time. Also, positive discrimination skill for WPWP index ends at year 4, but picks up again in year 8 for some of the ESMs and the MME. For all three indices, there are several ensemble members from each ESM which have very high discrimination skill as shown in Fig.
