 </sup> can alleviate plant water stress during growing season. The relative increase of total primary productivities for the permafrost region is 8% (9.5 vs. 8.8 Pg C per year for GPP; 5.3 vs. 4.9 Pg C per year for NPP); thus, the 39% increase of SOC in yesSOM is mainly driven by the cooler summer-time soil temperature that slows down soil respiration in the model (Supplementary Discussion).
