<p id="Par13" class="p">The reduction of soil thermal diffusivity by the presence of organic matter (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>) leads to a stronger dampening of the seasonal-cycle amplitude along the soil depth, and thus cools the deeper soils during summer, thins the active layer thickness (ALT), and reduces microbial respiration of SOC during the thawing season. To investigate the magnitude of this SOM effect on soil temperature and SOC accumulation, we conducted two simulations of the ORCHIDEE-MICT
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>
 </sup> land surface model, with (hereafter yesSOM) and without (hereafter noSOM) the impacts of SOM on soil thermo- and hydrodynamics. The SOM insulation effect in the model was implemented via SOM-dependent soil physical parameters including thermal conductivity, heat capacity, porosity and available water capacity, with detailed descriptions in ref.

 <italic class="italic">D</italic> values which are more consistent with observations than the results of noSOM (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">9</xref>). Peak summer-time monthly mean soil temperature decreases by about 4 °C on average at 0.8 and 1.6 m depths for the sites in permafrost region in yesSOM compared to noSOM (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">10</xref>). Consequently, ALT decreases by 0.6 m averagely across the region due to the presence of SOM (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a, b</xref>), and the permafrost area (ALT &lt; 3 m) increases from 10.4 in noSOM to 13.8 million km
