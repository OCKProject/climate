<p id="Par7" class="p">We find a significant negative correlation between soil thermal diffusivity (log-transformed) and soil organic carbon density (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). This empirical result confirms that soils with more organic materials have a lower thermal diffusivity. Among all the tested soil characteristics including soil texture (fractions of sand, silt and clay)

 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> has the strongest explanatory power for 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic> variations among the different site-depths. Considering the interrelation between these soil properties, e.g., SOC density is negatively correlated with bulk density (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">4</xref>), we conducted partial correlation analysis to test if the 
 <italic class="italic">D-</italic>SOC relationship persists after removing the effect of other variables. The partial correlation between 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic> and SOC density remains significant after controlling the other properties separately or combined (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>). This suggests that the impact of SOC on 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic> is a composite result of soil composition and structure alterations such that its correlation with 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic> cannot be fully accounted for by the variability in the texture- and porosity-related properties.
