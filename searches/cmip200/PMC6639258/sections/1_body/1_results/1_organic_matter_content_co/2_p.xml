 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref> include a spatial-scale mismatch: the local soil temperature observations are not accompanied by collocated records of soil texture, moisture and organic carbon; we therefore resort to the global (WISE
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">25</xref>
 </sup>) and regional (NCSCD
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">28</xref>
 </sup>) databases for these soil properties, which are not fully representative for site-level observations. In addition, even at broad-scale, soil inventories bear substantial uncertainties

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">29</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">30</xref>
 </sup>. The two databases used here differ in total carbon stock by about 20% for their overlapping areas (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">5ab</xref>, 690 Pg C in WISE vs. 825 Pg C in NCSCD for 0–2 m depth). Both databases derive their spatial distributions by linking field data of soil profiles to global/regional soil classification maps, their accuracy depending on both the accuracy of the up-scaling maps and the representativeness of samples within each soil class. Thus, the high landscape complexity in the northern permafrost zone and limited soil profiles available from Siberia

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">25</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>
 </sup> add to uncertainties in this region. To partly reduce this uncertainty, we excluded the site-depth data whose relative difference in SOC density between the two databases is higher than 25% (see Methods and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">5c</xref>).
