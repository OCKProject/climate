<p id="Par9" class="p">Apart from the predominant role of SOC, soil moisture also affects 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic>, especially in dry soils where an increased soil water act as bridges to improve thermal contacts between soil particles

 </sup>. A laboratory experiment
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">32</xref>
 </sup> showed that for sandy soils, 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic> increases rapidly with moisture content when the water content is less than 0.1–0.2 m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> m
 <sup class="sup">−3</sup>, and then remains stable or slightly decreases; while for cohesive soils of silty and clayey texture, the variation of 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic> with moisture is smaller. To investigate if soil moisture can explain the spatial variability of 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic>, we used two data sets, the satellite-based surface soil moisture product (ESA-CCI-SM
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>
 </sup>) and the depth-specific soil moisture simulated by a land surface model (ERA-Interim/Land
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>
 </sup>). Neither of them shows significant correlation with 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic>, possibly because the annual mean moisture contents at the sites are mostly higher than 0.2 m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> m
 <sup class="sup">−3</sup>, a saturation level sufficient to bridge air gaps between soil grains (see Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref> and Supplementary Discussion). Apart from total moisture content, its phase composition also affects 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic>, since ice has a much higher 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic> than water (1.1 vs. 0.14 × 10
 <sup class="sup">−6</sup> m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> s
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>)
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>
 </sup>. Soils in the northern permafrost region often contain abundant ground ice
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>
 </sup> that can exceed soil porosity, including segregated ice and ice wedges
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">34</xref>
 </sup>. These occurrences of excess ice beyond soil pores modify soil thermal properties and add to the heterogeneity of permafrost soils
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">35</xref>
 </sup>, contributing to the scatter in observations shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> and Supplementary Figs. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref>. Considering a potential confounding effect of ground ice on the correlation between SOC and 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic> shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> (as a deeper depth could feature both lower SOC density and higher ice content, as well as a higher 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic>), we calculated the regression for the top depth interval only (&lt;0.4 m) (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">6</xref>), which is generally above the permanently frozen layer and less affected by large ice volumes. The similar results as Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> indicate that the observed strong correlation between SOC and 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic> is unlikely confounded by ice content.
