<p id="Par10" class="p">Thermal diffusivity (
 <italic class="italic">D</italic>) is a key feature in the soil thermal regime. Its parameterization in land surface models may fundamentally impact their broad-scale patterns of soil temperature and permafrost distribution. Yet, this process has been given little attention. To test this, we analyzed the outputs of the historical experiment from a set of Earth System Models (ESMs) that participated in the fifth phase of the Climate Model Inter-comparison Project (CMIP5)
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">36</xref>
 </sup>. As the simulated climate differs among the models, the total area of grid cells with mean annual air temperature (MAAT) less than 0 °C (A
 <sub class="sub">MAAT&lt;0</sub>) ranges from 22 to 32 million km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>, with a standard deviation of 2.7 million km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref>). As expected, simulated near-surface permafrost area (A
 <sub class="sub">p</sub>, defined as modelled active layer thickness less than 3 m (ref. 
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref>
 </sup>), see Methods) is significantly correlated with 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>
 <sub class="sub">MAAT&lt;0</sub>, with a slope slightly larger than 1, which might be related to the continuity of permafrost (namely, in models with a warm bias, permafrost area is underestimated more strongly, as they miss the sub-grid discontinuous permafrost in the southern grid cells). However, the difference in MAAT among the models can only partly explain the much wider variation in 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>
 <sub class="sub">p</sub> across the models, with a standard variation of 7.5 million km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref>). The ratio between the two areas (
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>
 <sub class="sub">p</sub>/
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>
 <sub class="sub">MAAT&lt;0</sub>) is determined by both air-soil interface energy exchanges affected by vegetation and snow covers, and sub-surface heat transfer in the soil column affected by soil thermal properties. Here it appears to be the latter that dominates 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>
 <sub class="sub">p</sub>/
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>
 <sub class="sub">MAAT&lt;0</sub> in the CMIP5 models, since 69% of the variation in 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>
 <sub class="sub">p</sub>/
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>
 <sub class="sub">MAAT&lt;0</sub> can be explained simply by differences in simulated 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic> between models (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b</xref>). Note that the 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic> values for each model are diagnosed from their outputted monthly soil temperatures after excluding the pixels where non-conductive processes are not negligible (the same treatment as the observations, see Methods).
