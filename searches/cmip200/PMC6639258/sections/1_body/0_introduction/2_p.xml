<p id="Par4" class="p">The heat conduction in the soil, assuming a uniform and constant medium, can be described by the one-dimensional Fourier’s Law (Eqs. [
 <xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="" class="xref">1</xref>] and (
 <xref rid="Equ2" ref-type="" class="xref">2</xref>) in “Methods” section)

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>
 </sup>, in which thermal diffusivity, 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic>, is the key parameter that describes the rate at which soil temperature changes given a temperature gradient. The value of 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic> is determined by soil composition (minerals, air, water/ice, organic matter) and soil structure
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>
 </sup>. Among the different soil constituents, thermal diffusivity of soil organic matter (SOM) is an order of magnitude smaller than that of typical soil minerals, and slightly smaller than water
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>
 </sup>. Structurally, a higher organic matter content in the soil increases soil porosity
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>
 </sup>, which also decreases soil thermal conductivity and 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic> especially when the soil pores are filled with air. As a result, SOM acts as an insulator and the presence of SOM cools the soil during summer, while its warming effect during winter is less important due to the insulating snow cover

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>
 </sup>. The summer-time cooling effect of SOM in turn restrains microbial decomposition
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>
 </sup> and favours the accumulation of SOC. Given the high SOC storage in permafrost soils and the high vulnerability and sensitivity of these carbon stocks to projected warming
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>
 </sup>, it is important to assess the quantitative impact of SOC on 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic> and the potential acceleration of soil warming due to the loss of SOC and its insulating effect.
