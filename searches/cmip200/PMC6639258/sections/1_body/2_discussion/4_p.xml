 </sup> for the sensitivity of permafrost area to warming was also based on the assumption of an unchanged present-day MAAT-permafrost relationship for future scenarios. In contrast, the results shown here implies a non-linear trajectory of permafrost area changes in response to warming, highlighting a critical need to explicitly represent the coupling between SOC and soil thermal dynamics in models that are utilized to project the future of permafrost.
