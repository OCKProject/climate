Such complex interactions call for models that quantitatively integrates thermo-hydrological processes, their heterogeneity at small spatial scales, vegetation dynamics and soil carbon cycle, thermal impacts of organic matter, and fires, in order to improve our understanding and prediction of the overall vulnerability of permafrost.
