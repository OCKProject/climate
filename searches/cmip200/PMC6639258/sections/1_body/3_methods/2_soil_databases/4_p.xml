<p id="Par38" class="p">A linear relationship was found between log-transformed 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic> and SOC density (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>); we therefore used log
 <sub class="sub">10</sub>(
 <italic class="italic">D</italic>) in all the correlation analyses. A log-transformation of 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic> also improves its normality. To explore the potential multivariate relationships, we conducted a stepwise regression analysis using SOC density (from WISE and NCSCD respectively) and all the other soil properties as predictive variables. In the case of SOC from NCSCD, none of the other variables are significant in the stepwise regression to explain 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic> variations, namely, the addition of other properties does not increase the explanatory power compared to the log
 <sub class="sub">10</sub>(
 <italic class="italic">D</italic>)-SOC
 <sub class="sub">NCSCD</sub> regression model. In the case of SOC from WISE, only silt fraction is significant, but R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> only marginally increases from 0.35 to 0.37, and the slope of SOC
 <sub class="sub">WISE</sub> in the stepwise regression equation (−0.010) is only slightly different from that in the single-variable regression (−0.012).
