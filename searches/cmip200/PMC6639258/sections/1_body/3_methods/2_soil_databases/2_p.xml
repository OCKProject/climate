 </sup>. However, NCSCD is a regional database for the northern permafrost zones only, and does not provide other properties like soil texture and bulk density. We therefore used both databases for SOC and used WISE for other soil properties. At their highest resolution (0.012° for NCSCD and 30 arc second for WISE), we took the grid cells whose center is nearest to the coordinates of each observation site. The two databases provide different depth intervals (4 intervals down to 3 m in NCSCD, and 7 intervals down to 2 m in WISE), and we integrated their original layers into the same four depth intervals as 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic> values mentioned above (0–0.4, 0.4–0.8, 0.8–2, and 2–3 m), using depth-weighted averages. WISE does not provide information below 2 m, so its variables for the 4
