The 75th percentile of the SSE values for air temperatures, 0.34, was chosen to filter the soil temperature data: the observation for a site-depth-year is removed if its SSE is higher than 0.34. After this filtering, 170 sites from RHST and 15 sites from IPY remained. Note that the retained sites do not necessarily fulfil the SSE threshold for all years or depths; those depth-years that exceed the threshold were also removed before the calculation of
