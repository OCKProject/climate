<p id="Par32" class="p">In terms of the spatial distribution of removed sites, the sites located in warmer permafrost regions (discontinuous, sporadic and isolated permafrost zones) have a higher removal percentage (52%, 41 sites out of 79) than those in the continuous permafrost zone (35%, 28 out of 80) and in non-permafrost regions (17%, 20 out of 115) (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>). This could be plausibly explained by the near-0 °C of the mean annual permafrost temperature in the relatively warmer permafrost regions, where a partial freezing/thawing at upper permafrost and inter-annual climate variability could induce significant amounts of latent heat

 </sup>. A comparison of MAAT of retained vs. removed sites also shows significant differences in both permafrost regions (including continuous and discontinuous categories) and non-permafrost region, with the removed sites having a closer-to-zero MAAT than retained sites (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">15</xref>). We also compared the ground ice abundance (extracted from the IPA map
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>
 </sup>, which gives three levels of abundance) to test whether the filtering would preferentially remove the sites with high ground ice contents. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">16</xref>, no such difference was found between removed and retained sites. No significant difference in the surface soil moisture (extracted from ESA-CCI-SM v02.2 product

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>
 </sup>) was found between the removed and retained sites (not shown).
