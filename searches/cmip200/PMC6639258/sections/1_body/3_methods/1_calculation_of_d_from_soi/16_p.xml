<p id="Par34" class="p">Third, for the retained site-depth-year data after step ii), we calculated the 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic> value for each depth according to Eq. [
 <xref rid="Equ5" ref-type="" class="xref">5</xref>], using the observed temperature amplitude of this layer and of the adjacent upper layer, only if the two depths are nearby (&lt;1 m). Since we try to correlate 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic> with soil properties extracted from the global/regional soil databases which have fixed/limited layers (see below), the derived 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic> values for different depths were integrated into four depth intervals: 0–0.4, 0.4–0.8, 0.8–2, and 2–3 m, taking the median 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic> if multiple depths are available within each interval. Finally, if multiple years of 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic> are available for a site-depth, their median value is used for the regression analysis against soil properties, while their 25th–75th percentiles are shown in Fig.
