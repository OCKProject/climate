<p id="Par31" class="p">Most of the high SSE situations are associated with the so-called zero curtain effect, namely, the soil temperature stays near 0 °C during extended periods of freezing/thawing, maintained by the release/absorption of latent heat and by other non-conductive processes including vapor transport and evaporation/condensation

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">14</xref> presents four examples from the IPY dataset to illustrate the disparity or similarity between soil temperature observations and the theoretical sine-waves. Whenever prominent zero curtain occurs, the SSE value will be much higher than 0.34 (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">14ab</xref>). Note that the presence of zero curtain effects, although of smaller impact on the season cycle after the data screening by SSE threshold, may lead to an underestimation in the derived
