 <xref rid="Equ4" ref-type="" class="xref">4</xref>) is an idealized mathematical model to describe the real-world soil thermal regime, its applicability requiring several necessary conditions: first, the heat transfer in the soil is dominated by conduction, so that convection, radiation, and particularly the latent heat release/absorption associated with phase transitions are of minor importance at the seasonal-cycle time-scale; second, the soil thermal properties are relatively constant over time and uniform along the considered depth interval; and third, soil temperature at the upper boundary follows a sinusoidal function. If the real soil thermodynamics at a site significantly violates any of the above conditions, it is unlikely that the soil temperature function 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>(z,t) would take the simple sinusoidal form as Eq. [
 <xref rid="Equ4" ref-type="" class="xref">4</xref>]. We therefore assume that, if the measured soil monthly temperatures at two adjacent depths both conform to sine-waves (with a small error), the soil thermodynamics in this interval can be approximated by Eq. [
 <xref rid="Equ2" ref-type="" class="xref">2</xref>], and the calculated 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic> using Eq. [
 <xref rid="Equ5" ref-type="" class="xref">5</xref>] is a valid value that describes the thermal diffusivity for the bulk soil in this depth interval at the site.
