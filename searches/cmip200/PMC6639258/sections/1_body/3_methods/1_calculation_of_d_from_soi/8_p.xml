 </sup> (IPY). RHST provides monthly soil temperature records at 263 sites since the 1880s until 1990, but the majority of data exist after 1960. Here we used the last ten years’ data, from 1981 to 1990. RHST contains measurements at multiple depths for near surface (0.02–0.2 m) and deeper (mostly at 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.2, 1.6, 2.4, and 3.2 m) soils, but the near surface measurements were taken in bare areas whereas the deeper soil measurements were taken under natural cover of grasses and snow

 </sup>; so we only used the data below 0.2 m in our analysis. The IPY soil temperatures were measured at various depths dependent on the site, mostly for the years 2007–2013. The daily observations in IPY dataset were aggregated to monthly means.
