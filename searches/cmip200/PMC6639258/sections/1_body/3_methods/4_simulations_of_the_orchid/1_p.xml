<p id="Par44" class="p">We incorporated the impacts of organic carbon on soil thermal and hydrological properties in the ORCHIDEE-MICT land surface model, assuming that soil physical properties are weighted averages of mineral soil and pure organic soil. Detailed descriptions can be found in ref.

We conducted two simulations for the northern hemisphere (&gt;30°N) at 2° spatial resolution forced by CRUNCEP v8 climate: yesSOM, in which an observation-based SOC map was used in the thermal and hydrological modules to derive soil properties; and noSOM, in which the thermal and hydrological modules see zero SOC, i.e., no impacts of SOC on soil properties. For yesSOM, the observational SOC map was constructed from NCSCD
