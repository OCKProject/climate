<p id="Par40" class="p">For the simulated thermal diffusivity, the same procedure as the calculation of 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic> for the sites was carried out using the outputted monthly soil temperatures by each model for all land grid cells and soil layers. Specifically, the same SSE threshold of 0.34 was adopted to exclude the pixel-depth-years whose monthly soil temperature oscillations do not conform to sine-waves. Since the CMIP5 models have different (or a lack of) parameterizations for the soil freezing process

 </sup>, their SSE values differ (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">17</xref>). In general, the models that do not consider the latent heat associated with water phase change (CMCC, IPSL, and MPI families) produce sine wave-shaped monthly soil temperatures and thus have smaller SSE values (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">17</xref>). Applying the SSE threshold before calculating 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic> values for each model could reduce the confounding effect of their different parameterizations for the freezing-induces latent heat.
