<p id="Par39" class="p">We used all CMIP5 ESMs that provide access to their historical simulation (r1i1p1) on the website

To calculate active layer thickness (ALT) of each grid cell, we firstly calculated the maximum monthly soil temperature (

 <sub class="sub">s,max</sub>) for each soil level, then took the deepest depth where 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>
 <sub class="sub">s,max</sub> was at or above 0 °C. If the depth of 0 °C was between two soil levels, a linear interpolation was used to locate the depth. Permafrost is defined to be present in a grid cell if ALT is less than 3 m or the deepest model soil level, following ref
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref>. which gives an approximation of near-surface permafrost.
