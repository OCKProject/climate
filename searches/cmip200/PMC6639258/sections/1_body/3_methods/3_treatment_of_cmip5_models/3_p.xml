<p id="Par41" class="p">The CMIP5 models have different vertical soil layers (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">18</xref>), and here we only calculated the 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic> values for the upper 3 m, and integrated them into the same four depth intervals as the observations. Then, to compare with the observation-derived 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic> values at the RHST and IPY sites, the same locations (nearest grid cell center to the site coordinates) were selected for each model, thus deriving the results shown in Fig.
