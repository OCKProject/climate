However, there are considerable uncertainties in future drought projections. Here, we focus on agricultural drought by analyzing surface soil moisture outputs from CMIP5 multi-model ensembles (MMEs) under RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5 scenarios. First, the annual mean soil moisture by the end of the 21st century shows statistically significant large-scale drying and limited areas of wetting for all scenarios, with stronger drying as the strength of radiative forcing increases. Second, the MME mean spatial extent of severe drought is projected to increase for all regions and all future RCP scenarios, and most notably in Central America (CAM), Europe and Mediterranean (EUM), Tropical South America (TSA), and South Africa (SAF). Third, the model uncertainty presents the largest source of uncertainty (over 80%) across the entire 21st century among the three sources of uncertainty: internal variability, model uncertainty, and scenario uncertainty. Finally, we find that the spatial pattern and magnitude of annual and seasonal signal to noise (S/N) in soil moisture anomalies do not change significantly by lead time, indicating that the spreads of uncertainties become larger as the signals become stronger.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/100007298</institution-id><institution>United States Department of Commerce | NOAA | Climate Program Office (NOAA Climate Program Office)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NA11OAR4310148</award-id><award-id>NA16OAR4310163</award-id><award-id>NA11OAR4310148</award-id><award-id>NA16OAR4310163</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>Junyu</given-names></name><name><surname>Carbone</surname><given-names>Gregory J.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>SPARC Graduate Research Grant from the Office of the Vice President for Research at the University of South Carolina</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Future drought risks could be exacerbated by spatiotemporal changes in hydrometeorological variables due to climate change<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Warming associated with climate change accelerates land surface drying, enhances evapotranspiration, and increases the potential incidence and severity of droughts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Changes in the frequency, intensity, and duration of droughts would have significant impacts on water management, natural resources, agriculture, aquatic ecosystems, and socioeconomic sectors. In the context of climate change, it is important for decision makers to understand how drought conditions might change at the regional scale in order to plan adequate adaptation and mitigation strategies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Drought is a complex multivariate phenomenon caused by the interaction of atmospheric, hydrological, and biogeophysical processes. There are considerable uncertainties in evaluating drought trends both in the instrumental record and future drought projections. For example, the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> concluded that, since the 1970s, more intense and longer droughts have been observed over wider areas, particularly in the tropics and subtropics, which are linked with higher temperatures and decreased precipitation. However, the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> indicated that the global increasing trends in drought since 1970 were no longer supported. Recent evidence has yielded conflicting results on drought changes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Such phenomena demonstrate the challenges and uncertainties in quantitatively detecting long-term changes of this complex phenomenon. In addition to uncertainties with respect to past observations, there are even more considerable uncertainties associated with future drought projection centering on a different set of factors including inherent climate variability, model errors, and uncertainty in future radiative forcing.</p><p id="Par4">Prior works investigating potential changes in drought have revealed that different drought indices can produce different results due to different variables involved in calculating the drought indices from the general circulation models (GCMs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. The drought indices including temperature and evapotranspiration effects, e.g., Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, Supply-Demand Drought Index (SDDI)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, etc., usually project stronger drought risks than the drought indices using only precipitation or runoff, e.g., Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, Standardized Runoff Index (SRI)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, etc<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Droughts involve a wide range of related variables. Different types of drought highlight different variables of interest, for example, meteorological droughts highlight precipitation, agricultural droughts highlight soil moisture, and hydrological droughts highlight streamflow/runoff&#x0200a;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. In this study, we focus on agricultural drought. Agricultural droughts reduce soil-water availability, affect crop production and yield, and pose threats to food security and livestock industries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Soil moisture is an important indicator for agricultural drought since it can reflect the total effects of precipitation and evapotranspiration, represent the status of agriculture, and determine the available water supply for healthy plant growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Modeling soil moisture changes is much more complicated than precipitation and temperature. Future soil moisture changes depend on the total interaction of temperature and precipitation, the complex surface hydrological process, as well as other factors, such as wind speed, vegetation, land use/cover change,&#x000a0;and atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> (influence plant stomatal conductance and hence plant transpiration)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Thus, we use soil moisture as an integrative variable to reflect the change in agricultural drought risks.</p><p id="Par6">Prior studies have assessed and quantified the uncertainty associated with primary climate variables like surface air temperature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> and precipitation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. There also have been several efforts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> to evaluate the performance of GCMs to simulate the soil moisture using in situ or satellite observations and several attempts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> to project future drought conditions using soil moisture data from GCMs. However, fewer studies have assessed and quantified the sources of uncertainties in projecting future agricultural drought conditions. AR5 stated that the regional to global-scale projections of drought conditions remain relatively uncertain compared to other aspects of the water cycle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Understanding and modeling uncertainties and hotspots in drought projection are of great importance in natural resources and water resources planning management. Quantifying and partitioning uncertainty associated with drought is also very important for decision makers to understand the scope and direction for narrowing the uncertainty through investment in climate science<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">Here, we use all available GCMs providing surface soil moisture outputs under the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5), which enable us to capture model uncertainty in the representation of climate sensitivity and climate process. We use all available representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios: RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 6.0, and RCP 8.5, which enable us to understand the uncertainty originating from unknown future greenhouse gas emissions and radiative forcing. We focus on agricultural drought and use soil moisture as an important indicator for agricultural drought. We analyze the raw GCMs outputs for surface soil moisture, instead of computing drought indices from related variables, which may introduce additional uncertainty. First, we investigate the multi-model ensemble (MME) annual and seasonal percentage change of surface soil moisture and evaluate the statistical significance of change using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test for each grid by controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) at a significance level of 0.05. Second, we calculate the duration, frequency, severity, and spatial extent of severe agricultural drought and analyze the spatial-temporal change of those drought characteristics. Third, we quantify and partition the three sources of uncertainty associated with these drought projections: internal variability, model uncertainty, and scenario uncertainty. Finally, we examine the spatiotemporal variability of annual and seasonal signal to noise (S/N) change in soil moisture anomalies across the globe and for different lead times to measure the magnitude of the expected change compared with the uncertainty in the projection.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Global multi-model mean surface soil moisture change</title><p id="Par8">We investigate future agricultural drought change by calculating the multi-model mean percentage change in annual/seasonal mean surface soil moisture for the period of 2071&#x02013;2100 (RCP forcing) relative to 1976&#x02013;2005 (historical forcing) for each emission scenario (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Percentage change is calculated because the magnitude of surface soil moisture varies by model; a 30-year period is chosen to sufficiently filter out interannual variability, but maintain multi-decadal variability. We also evaluate the statistical significance of change using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test, which is a nonparametric distribution-free paired-sample hypothesis testing procedure. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test is usually used as an alternative to paired two-sample student t-test when the assumption of normality is violated. Here, 9746 out of 29376 (33.18%) Shapiro-Wilk normality tests on a per-pixel basis reject the null hypothesis that the annual mean surface soil moisture from different GCMs for the period of 1976&#x02013;2005 or the period of 2071&#x02013;2100 are normally distributed at a significance level of 0.05. Thus, we perform a Wilcoxon signed-rank test (two-tailed) for each grid and each scenario by testing the null hypothesis that the distribution of the annual/seasonal mean surface soil moisture for different GCMs for the period of 1976&#x02013;2005 (historical forcing) and the period of 2071&#x02013;2100 (RCP forcing) are the same. A paired two-sample hypothesis test is used to control sources of variability in which the annual/seasonal mean soil moisture for the two 30-year periods from the same GCM is a matched-pair sample. An independent two-sample test is not appropriate in such cases. Moreover, since we perform multiple comparisons using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and calculate the p-values for more than 3000 grids for each scenario, we control for the false discovery rate (FDR) (i.e., the expected proportion of false discoveries among the total number of discoveries) for multiple comparisons at a significance level of 0.05 and adjust the p-value for each grid cell following the method of Benjamini and Hochberg<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Global multi-model mean percentage change in annual mean surface soil moisture for the period of 2071&#x02013;2100 (RCP forcing) relative to 1976&#x02013;2005 (historical forcing) based on CMIP5 multi-model ensembles (MMEs) under four scenarios: RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5. The grids with stippling indicate statistical significance using the non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test by controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) at a significance level of 0.05, i.e., there is a strong evidence that the distribution of annual mean surface soil moisture from different GCMs for period of 2071&#x02013;2100 and the period of 1976&#x02013;2005 is not the same for those grid cells.

The overall spatial patterns of drying and wetting are generally consistent across the four RCP scenarios, with stronger drying as forcing increases (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The soil moisture drying in the Mediterranean, southwestern USA, northeast South America, and southern Africa is associated with projected widening of the Hadley Circulation that shifts downwelling and inhibits precipitation in these regions and globally increased temperature and evapotranspiration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par10">The changing signal is more pronounced in winter and summer than annually because of compensating effects during the whole year (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, Supplementary Figs&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>).

In most cases, the increase in the frequency of short-term drought is higher for RCP2.6 than RCP8.5. There are several cases where the frequency of short-term drought is projected to decrease for the highest radiative forcing RCP8.5 compared to the historical period, such as Eastern North America (ENA), Europe and Mediterranean (EUM), South Africa (SAF), Tropical South America (TSA), and the global. This is because, in the RCP8.5 scenario, sequences of consecutive dry months are more likely, thus increasing the frequency of long-term drought and decreasing the frequency of short-term drought. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2(a)</xref> shows that the median frequency of long-term drought is projected to increase in most regions, with the greatest increase in EUM, TSA, Central America (CAM), ENA, and SAF, and the smallest increase in North Asia (NAS), South Asia (SAS), Central Africa (CAF), and North Africa (NAF).

Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> shows the regional seasonal patterns of future drought projections in the RCP forcing compared with the historical forcing. The multi-model mean spatial extents of severe drought are projected to increase for all regions and all future RCP scenarios, with progressively larger spatial extent of severe drought as the strength of radiative forcing increases (RCP8.5&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;RCP6.0&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;RCP4.5&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;RCP2.6) in most cases. The increase in the spatial extent of drought tends to be larger in warmer seasons than cooler seasons in most regions. In southern hemisphere (TSA, SSA, AUS, and SAF), the largest increase in spatial extent occurs predominantly in the Austral Spring. The increase in the spatial extent of soil moisture deficit in high latitude regions (e.g. NAS) tends to be concentrated in the warmer season and diminished in the cooler season. The seasonal disproportionate change of soil moisture deficit is mainly because of changes in snow and ice. During the cooler season, the temperature increase tends to reduce the snow cover, increase the ratio of rainfall to snowfall, and drive earlier spring melting which limits soil moisture deficit, while during the warmer season, earlier spring melting coupled with higher evapotranspiration strengthen the soil moisture deficit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. This mechanism leads to the seasonal disproportionate change in the spatial extent of drought in warmer months compared with the cooler months in high latitude regions.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Global and regional multi-model ensemble mean, 30-year mean of the monthly spatial extent of severe drought for the period of 1976&#x02013;2005 in historical forcing and 2071&#x02013;2100 in RCP forcing under four emission scenarios: RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2019_41196_Fig3_HTML" id="d29e488"/></fig></p><p id="Par13">CAM and EUM show the largest spread across emission scenarios, i.e., these regions respond very differently to different radiative forcing compared with other regions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). For those regions, the highest radiative forcing (RCP8.5) creates a much greater spatial extent of drought than the lowest radiative forcing (RCP2.6). By contrast, NAF, SAS, SEA, and CAF show the smallest spread resulting from different emission scenarios (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), i.e., the spatial extent of drought in these regions is relatively insensitive to the differences in radiative forcing compared with other regions.</p><p id="Par14">We fit empirical CDFs of the global monthly spatial extent of drought for each individual model for the 360-month in the period of 1976&#x02013;2005 (historical forcing) and the 360-month in the period of 2071&#x02013;2100 (RCP forcing) to investigate both the mean change and temporal variability (inter-month variability) change (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Most of the GCMs project increases in the spatial extent of severe drought, in which the RCP8.5 shows the largest increase. The MMEs under RCP forcing show very large inter-model uncertainty, in which RCP8.5 shows the widest range of projections, while RCP2.6 shows the narrowest range of projections, indicating that the projection uncertainty increases as the radiative forcing increases. This is true when the four RCP scenarios contain the same set of GCMs (not shown here). Furthermore, for each individual GCM projection under RCP forcing, in most cases, the CDFs, especially under RCP8.5, are flatter when compared with the CDFs using historical forcing, indicating greater temporal (inter-month) variability in the spatial extent of severe drought, i.e., more widespread drought and more extreme drought events.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Empirical cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of the global monthly spatial extent of severe drought for the period of 1976&#x02013;2005 (360 months) in historical forcing and 2071&#x02013;2100 (360 months) in RCP forcing under four emission scenarios: RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5.

The multi-model and multi-scenario mean spatial extent of CAM, EUM, TSA, and SAF are projected to increase the most, while the mean spatial extent of SAS, SEA, NAS, and CAF are projected to increase the least.

We evaluate the statistical significance of change in surface soil moisture using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test for each grid and control for false discovery rate (FDR) at a significance level of 0.05. We have found statistically significant annual drying over most of Australia, South America, North America, south Africa, Europe and Mediterranean, and east Asia, with stronger drying as the strength of forcing increases, but statistically significant wetting in limited areas of east Africa, south Asia, and central Asia by the end of the 21st century. The soil moisture drying in the Mediterranean, southwestern USA, northeast South America, and southern African is mainly associated with the projected widening of the Hadley Circulation and increased temperature and evapotranspiration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. The drying or wetting signal is more pronounced for seasonal than annual because of compensating effects for the whole year. We also have detected a strong seasonality in many regions in the mid- and high-latitude of North Hemisphere, with wetting in winter and drying in summer.</p><p id="Par24">We calculate the duration, frequency, severity, and spatial extent of the severe agricultural drought (i.e., that which occurs approximately once every ten years for specific month). The multi-model median frequency of short-term drought is projected to increase by the end of the 21st century in most regions and most scenarios. In most cases, the increase in the frequency of short-term drought is higher for the RCP2.6 than the RCP8.5. In the latter scenario, individual months are more likely to cluster into consecutive dry months to form a long-term drought. The median frequency of long-term drought is also projected to increase in most regions, with the strongest increase in EUM, TSA, CAM, ENA, and SAF. The multi-model mean projects increased spatial extent of severe drought for all regions and all emission scenarios, with progressively larger spatial extent of severe drought as the strength of radiative forcing increases by the end of the 21st century. The multi-model and multi-scenario mean spatial extent of severe drought in CAM, EUM, TSA, and SAF are projected to increase the most. The increase in the spatial extent of drought tends to be larger in warmer seasons than cooler seasons in most regions because of increasing temperature and evapotranspiration. The inter-model variability is high and contributes the most to uncertainty in future projections and this source of uncertainty increases with radiative forcing, i.e., the model uncertainty is higher for RCP8.5 than for RCP2.6. Compared with the historical period (1976&#x02013;2005), each individual GCM projection in the future (2071&#x02013;2100) shows greater temporal (inter-month) variability in spatial extent of severe drought, indicating more widespread and extreme drought events. Furthermore, the variation in the spatial extent of drought across models are much larger than the variations across the RCP scenarios, i.e., the model spread is much larger than the scenario spread. The variation across models are also much larger than the variations across different regions, i.e., the model spread is much larger than the spatial heterogeneity.</p><p id="Par25">In addition to visualizing the uncertainties, we have partitioned and quantified the three dominant sources of uncertainty with respect to decadal mean standardized soil moisture anomalies, decadal sum of 1-month drought occurrence, decadal sum of severity, and decadal mean spatial extent of drought from CMIP5 MMEs. We have found that more than 80% of the uncertainty associated with future drought projection in the 21st century comes from differences between GCMs, model uncertainty. This dominance results because of different treatment of clouds and precipitation in the models, as well as various local factors considered in soil moisture modeling. Regional patterns of uncertainty partition in spatial extent of drought for those 15 regions are similar to that for global and model uncertainty contributes approximately 80% of the total uncertainty. The differences across regions in uncertainty partition result mainly from the slight differences in the magnitude of scenario uncertainty.</p><p id="Par26">When measured by simulated soil moisture conditions, drying occurs in large parts of the Mediterranean and Europe, many parts of the United States, Mexico, Southern Africa, many parts in Northern South America, Southeast China, West Australia, and the drying signal become stronger over lead time.

The wetting occurs in mid- to high-latitude Asia, high-latitude North America, India, east Argentina, and Sahara, but none of these regions have an S/N ratio greater than 1. The spread of uncertainty becomes larger as the signal becomes stronger and thus the spatial pattern and magnitude of S/N does not change significantly.</p><p id="Par27">Improving future projection of agricultural drought depends on improved model performance in simulating soil moisture, e.g., improved representation of the surface hydrological process. The GCMs might have limited ability to simulate the water cycle and all relevant interactions between the atmosphere and land surface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. This situation is further complicated by the fact of error propagation that model biases in one variable affect other variables through the causal chain (e.g. the simulation of soil moisture depends on the simulation of precipitation and evapotranspiration, representation of the soil layers and soil characteristics, etc.). The model uncertainty could be attributed to imperfect representation of the processes, or limited understanding of the very complex process, or inherent challenges in mathematically representing the processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, e.g., previous study also pointed out that there are large differences among CMIP5 GCMs to represent the permafrost soil thermal dynamics and the coupling between soil and air temperatures in the high latitude resulting in difference in snow physics and soil hydrology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Additionally, this study uses the upper 10&#x02009;cm surface soil moisture, instead of the total soil moisture.

The surface soil moisture (upper 10&#x02009;cm) provided by CMIP5 differs greatly model by model. For example, the global (excluding Antarctica and Greenland) annual mean surface soil moisture for the period of 1976&#x02013;2005 varies from 8.381&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup> in model IPSL-CM5A-MR to 33.598&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup> in model FGOALS-s2, while the standard deviation for the period of 1976&#x02013;2005 is only 0.058&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup> in model IPSL-CM5A-MR and 0.089&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup> in model FGOALS-s2.

A threshold value of 10% is chosen reflecting a drought condition for a specific month that could be expected once every ten years on average. Hence, following the method of Sheffield and Wood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, for each grid point, each month, and each GCM, an empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) is calculated for the surface soil moisture from the historical simulation (1900&#x02013;2005) and then the 10% quantile threshold of surface soil moisture is computed. A 1-month drought occurrence either in the historical period or future period is defined as the month with a surface soil moisture value lower than the 10% quantile threshold based on the ECDF. We selected a long enough historical period (106-year, 1900&#x02013;2005) to sufficiently account for the historical variability in surface soil moisture.</p><p id="Par32">Based on the theory of runs and the method of Sheffield and Wood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, a drought event is characterized in terms of duration, severity, intensity, and spatial extent. A consecutive sequence of 1-month drought occurrence results in a drought event of different durations. We define two types of drought duration based on the USDM: short-term drought (less than 6 months) and long-term drought (longer than or equal to 6 months). We define severity as the sum of deficit below the 10% threshold. For example, the cumulative probability of the surface soil moisture in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd month during a 3-month drought event are respectively 6%, 2%, and 3%, and hence the deficit below the 10% threshold for those three months is 4%, 8%, and 7% respectively. Consequently, the sum of deficit below the threshold is 19%, i.e., the severity of this drought event is 19%. We define intensity as the mean deficit below the threshold for a drought event, i.e., severity divided by duration. For example, the intensity of this 3-month duration drought mentioned above is 19%/3 (6.33%). We define spatial extent of drought as the percentage of grid points in which the surface soil moisture falls below the threshold for each month in the region of interest.
