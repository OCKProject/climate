  <p class="p">Global multi-model mean percentage change in annual mean surface soil moisture for the period of 2071–2100 (RCP forcing) relative to 1976–2005 (historical forcing) based on CMIP5 multi-model ensembles (MMEs) under four scenarios: RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5. The grids with stippling indicate statistical significance using the non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test by controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) at a significance level of 0.05, i.e., there is a strong evidence that the distribution of annual mean surface soil moisture from different GCMs for period of 2071–2100 and the period of 1976–2005 is not the same for those grid cells. The results are based on all available models for each RCP scenario and the corresponding models in the historical forcing.</p>
