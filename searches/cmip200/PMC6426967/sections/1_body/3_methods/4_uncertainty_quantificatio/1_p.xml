 </sup>: (1) internal variability of climate system, i.e., natural fluctuation, which arises in the absence of any radiative forcing; (2) model uncertainty (known as response uncertainty), which occurs because different GCMs project different climate changes in response to the same radiative forcing; and (3) scenario uncertainty, which arises from uncertainty in future anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, leading to uncertainty in future radiative forcing.
