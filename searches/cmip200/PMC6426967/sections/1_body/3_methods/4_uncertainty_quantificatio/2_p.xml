 </sup> to partition and quantify the uncertainties for drought projection. Here, we describe the method in brief. (1) For each individual projection, we fit a smooth fourth-order polynomial model to the decadal mean projection during the period, 1900–2100, to account for the non-linearity and to separate out the trend and internal variability. Each model is assumed independent for simplicity, although they don’t (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). The internal variability for each projection is defined as the variance of the residuals from the smooth fit. We assume that the internal variability is constant over lead time and that changes of internal variability are negligible. We take the multi-model mean of the variances of the residuals as the internal variability component. (2) For one particular scenario, the spread of different models is considered as the model uncertainty. We estimate the model uncertainty for each scenario as the variance of the smooth fits for different models. The multi-scenario mean of the variance is considered as an estimate of model uncertainty. (3) The spread of the multi-model mean for each scenario is considered as the scenario uncertainty. We estimate the scenario uncertainty as the variance of the multi-model means for the four scenarios. The model uncertainty and scenario uncertainty varies by lead time. Those three uncertainties are assumed independent from one another
