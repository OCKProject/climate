 </sup>. The surface soil moisture (upper 10 cm) provided by CMIP5 differs greatly model by model. For example, the global (excluding Antarctica and Greenland) annual mean surface soil moisture for the period of 1976–2005 varies from 8.381 kg/m

 <sup class="sup">2</sup> in model FGOALS-s2. Differences between models are far greater than interannual variability for a single model. Thus, comparing the raw surface soil moisture between models is not robust. Here, we compute the soil moisture anomalies using future projections (or historical simulation) minus the mean of historical simulation (1900–2005). In addition, since the interannual variability of soil moisture differs by model, we also compute the standardized soil moisture anomalies to investigate how future long-term changes compare to historical interannual variability

 </sup>. The standardized soil moisture anomalies are computed using future projections (or historical simulation) minus the mean of historical simulation (1900–2005) and normalized by interannual standard deviation of historical simulation (1900–2005). The anomalies are calculated for each model due to differences model by model, calculated for each month due to varying soil moisture conditions each month, and calculated for each pixel due to spatial heterogeneity.
