 </sup>. Our approach considers United States Drought Monitor (USDM) drought classification categories: D0 abnormally dry (21st to 30th percentile), D1 moderate drought (11st to 20th), D2 severe drought (6th to 10th), D3 extreme drought (3rd to 5th), and D4 exceptional drought (0 to 2nd) (

Here, we focus on severe drought and even worse (0 to 10th percentile), i.e., including D2, D3, and D4 drought category in USDM. A threshold value of 10% is chosen reflecting a drought condition for a specific month that could be expected once every ten years on average. Hence, following the method of Sheffield and Wood

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">23</xref>
 </sup>, for each grid point, each month, and each GCM, an empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) is calculated for the surface soil moisture from the historical simulation (1900–2005) and then the 10% quantile threshold of surface soil moisture is computed. A 1-month drought occurrence either in the historical period or future period is defined as the month with a surface soil moisture value lower than the 10% quantile threshold based on the ECDF. We selected a long enough historical period (106-year, 1900–2005) to sufficiently account for the historical variability in surface soil moisture.
