 </sup>, a drought event is characterized in terms of duration, severity, intensity, and spatial extent. A consecutive sequence of 1-month drought occurrence results in a drought event of different durations. We define two types of drought duration based on the USDM: short-term drought (less than 6 months) and long-term drought (longer than or equal to 6 months). We define severity as the sum of deficit below the 10% threshold. For example, the cumulative probability of the surface soil moisture in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd month during a 3-month drought event are respectively 6%, 2%, and 3%, and hence the deficit below the 10% threshold for those three months is 4%, 8%, and 7% respectively. Consequently, the sum of deficit below the threshold is 19%, i.e., the severity of this drought event is 19%. We define intensity as the mean deficit below the threshold for a drought event, i.e., severity divided by duration. For example, the intensity of this 3-month duration drought mentioned above is 19%/3 (6.33%). We define spatial extent of drought as the percentage of grid points in which the surface soil moisture falls below the threshold for each month in the region of interest. The area of each grid point is weighted by the cosine of the latitude to account for the actual grid size. We estimate the drought characteristics for the 15 regions defined by the IPCC
