<p id="Par29" class="p">We used the monthly surface (upper 10 cm) soil moisture (variable: mrsos) outputs from CMIP5 MMEs for historical simulations (1900–2005) and future projections (2006–2100). We used all available models providing surface soil moisture values during the simulation periods (listed in Supplementary Table

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>). All model outputs were interpolated onto a common 2° × 2° latitude-longitude grid by bilinear interpolation method to allow for computing multi-model mean and uncertainty. The multi-ensemble mean was calculated for each GCM and each scenario.
