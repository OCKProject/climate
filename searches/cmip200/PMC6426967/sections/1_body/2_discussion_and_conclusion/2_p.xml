<p id="Par24" class="p">We calculate the duration, frequency, severity, and spatial extent of the severe agricultural drought (i.e., that which occurs approximately once every ten years for specific month). The multi-model median frequency of short-term drought is projected to increase by the end of the 21st century in most regions and most scenarios. In most cases, the increase in the frequency of short-term drought is higher for the RCP2.6 than the RCP8.5. In the latter scenario, individual months are more likely to cluster into consecutive dry months to form a long-term drought. The median frequency of long-term drought is also projected to increase in most regions, with the strongest increase in EUM, TSA, CAM, ENA, and SAF. The multi-model mean projects increased spatial extent of severe drought for all regions and all emission scenarios, with progressively larger spatial extent of severe drought as the strength of radiative forcing increases by the end of the 21st century. The multi-model and multi-scenario mean spatial extent of severe drought in CAM, EUM, TSA, and SAF are projected to increase the most. The increase in the spatial extent of drought tends to be larger in warmer seasons than cooler seasons in most regions because of increasing temperature and evapotranspiration. The inter-model variability is high and contributes the most to uncertainty in future projections and this source of uncertainty increases with radiative forcing, i.e., the model uncertainty is higher for RCP8.5 than for RCP2.6. Compared with the historical period (1976–2005), each individual GCM projection in the future (2071–2100) shows greater temporal (inter-month) variability in spatial extent of severe drought, indicating more widespread and extreme drought events. Furthermore, the variation in the spatial extent of drought across models are much larger than the variations across the RCP scenarios, i.e., the model spread is much larger than the scenario spread. The variation across models are also much larger than the variations across different regions, i.e., the model spread is much larger than the spatial heterogeneity.</p>
