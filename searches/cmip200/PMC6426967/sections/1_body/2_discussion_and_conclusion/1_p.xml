<p id="Par23" class="p">We have analyzed the raw surface soil moisture outputs from all available GCMs for four RCP scenarios: RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5 under the CMIP5 framework. We evaluate the statistical significance of change in surface soil moisture using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test for each grid and control for false discovery rate (FDR) at a significance level of 0.05. We have found statistically significant annual drying over most of Australia, South America, North America, south Africa, Europe and Mediterranean, and east Asia, with stronger drying as the strength of forcing increases, but statistically significant wetting in limited areas of east Africa, south Asia, and central Asia by the end of the 21st century. The soil moisture drying in the Mediterranean, southwestern USA, northeast South America, and southern African is mainly associated with the projected widening of the Hadley Circulation and increased temperature and evapotranspiration

 </sup>. The drying or wetting signal is more pronounced for seasonal than annual because of compensating effects for the whole year. We also have detected a strong seasonality in many regions in the mid- and high-latitude of North Hemisphere, with wetting in winter and drying in summer.
