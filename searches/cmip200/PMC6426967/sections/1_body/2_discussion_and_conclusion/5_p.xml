<p id="Par27" class="p">Improving future projection of agricultural drought depends on improved model performance in simulating soil moisture, e.g., improved representation of the surface hydrological process. The GCMs might have limited ability to simulate the water cycle and all relevant interactions between the atmosphere and land surface

 </sup>. This situation is further complicated by the fact of error propagation that model biases in one variable affect other variables through the causal chain (e.g. the simulation of soil moisture depends on the simulation of precipitation and evapotranspiration, representation of the soil layers and soil characteristics, etc.). The model uncertainty could be attributed to imperfect representation of the processes, or limited understanding of the very complex process, or inherent challenges in mathematically representing the processes

 </sup>, e.g., previous study also pointed out that there are large differences among CMIP5 GCMs to represent the permafrost soil thermal dynamics and the coupling between soil and air temperatures in the high latitude resulting in difference in snow physics and soil hydrology

 </sup>. Additionally, this study uses the upper 10 cm surface soil moisture, instead of the total soil moisture. The surface soil moisture (upper 10 cm) data for different models are quantitatively more comparable than the total soil moisture due to the substantial differences between climate models in the soil depth and soil layers

 </sup>. The total soil moisture should have more uncertainty than the surface soil moisture because of differences in soil depth and layers. Many vegetation types are able to extract water from deeper soil layers

 </sup> and thus we need soil moisture of deeper layers with consistent soil depth and layers across different GCMs to better quantify the agricultural drought. Thus, we also advocate to standardize the soil schemes and improve the representation of soil layers across different GCMs from different modeling centers to reduce this structural uncertainty due to differences in soil depth and layers.
