<p id="Par25" class="p">In addition to visualizing the uncertainties, we have partitioned and quantified the three dominant sources of uncertainty with respect to decadal mean standardized soil moisture anomalies, decadal sum of 1-month drought occurrence, decadal sum of severity, and decadal mean spatial extent of drought from CMIP5 MMEs. We have found that more than 80% of the uncertainty associated with future drought projection in the 21st century comes from differences between GCMs, model uncertainty. This dominance results because of different treatment of clouds and precipitation in the models, as well as various local factors considered in soil moisture modeling. Regional patterns of uncertainty partition in spatial extent of drought for those 15 regions are similar to that for global and model uncertainty contributes approximately 80% of the total uncertainty. The differences across regions in uncertainty partition result mainly from the slight differences in the magnitude of scenario uncertainty.</p>
