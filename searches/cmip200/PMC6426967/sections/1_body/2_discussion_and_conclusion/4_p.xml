<p id="Par26" class="p">When measured by simulated soil moisture conditions, drying occurs in large parts of the Mediterranean and Europe, many parts of the United States, Mexico, Southern Africa, many parts in Northern South America, Southeast China, West Australia, and the drying signal become stronger over lead time. However, since the inter-model variability is so high, the S/N of drying in soil moisture is less than âˆ’1 in only limited regions including the Mediterranean and Europe, the southwestern United States, and southern Africa. The wetting occurs in mid- to high-latitude Asia, high-latitude North America, India, east Argentina, and Sahara, but none of these regions have an S/N ratio greater than 1. The spread of uncertainty becomes larger as the signal becomes stronger and thus the spatial pattern and magnitude of S/N does not change significantly.</p>
