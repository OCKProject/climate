 </sup>. Changes in the frequency, intensity, and duration of droughts would have significant impacts on water management, natural resources, agriculture, aquatic ecosystems, and socioeconomic sectors. In the context of climate change, it is important for decision makers to understand how drought conditions might change at the regional scale in order to plan adequate adaptation and mitigation strategies
