 </sup> to project future drought conditions using soil moisture data from GCMs. However, fewer studies have assessed and quantified the sources of uncertainties in projecting future agricultural drought conditions. AR5 stated that the regional to global-scale projections of drought conditions remain relatively uncertain compared to other aspects of the water cycle
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>
 </sup>. Understanding and modeling uncertainties and hotspots in drought projection are of great importance in natural resources and water resources planning management. Quantifying and partitioning uncertainty associated with drought is also very important for decision makers to understand the scope and direction for narrowing the uncertainty through investment in climate science
