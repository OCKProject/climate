<p id="Par3" class="p">Drought is a complex multivariate phenomenon caused by the interaction of atmospheric, hydrological, and biogeophysical processes. There are considerable uncertainties in evaluating drought trends both in the instrumental record and future drought projections. For example, the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4)
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>
 </sup> concluded that, since the 1970s, more intense and longer droughts have been observed over wider areas, particularly in the tropics and subtropics, which are linked with higher temperatures and decreased precipitation. However, the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5)
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>
 </sup> indicated that the global increasing trends in drought since 1970 were no longer supported. Recent evidence has yielded conflicting results on drought changes
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">7</xref>
 </sup>. Such phenomena demonstrate the challenges and uncertainties in quantitatively detecting long-term changes of this complex phenomenon. In addition to uncertainties with respect to past observations, there are even more considerable uncertainties associated with future drought projection centering on a different set of factors including inherent climate variability, model errors, and uncertainty in future radiative forcing.
