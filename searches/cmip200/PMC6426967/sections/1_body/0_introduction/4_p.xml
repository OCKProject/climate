<p id="Par5" class="p">Droughts involve a wide range of related variables. Different types of drought highlight different variables of interest, for example, meteorological droughts highlight precipitation, agricultural droughts highlight soil moisture, and hydrological droughts highlight streamflow/runoff

 </sup>. In this study, we focus on agricultural drought. Agricultural droughts reduce soil-water availability, affect crop production and yield, and pose threats to food security and livestock industries

 </sup>. Soil moisture is an important indicator for agricultural drought since it can reflect the total effects of precipitation and evapotranspiration, represent the status of agriculture, and determine the available water supply for healthy plant growth

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>
 </sup>. Modeling soil moisture changes is much more complicated than precipitation and temperature. Future soil moisture changes depend on the total interaction of temperature and precipitation, the complex surface hydrological process, as well as other factors, such as wind speed, vegetation, land use/cover change, and atmospheric CO

 </sup>. Thus, we use soil moisture as an integrative variable to reflect the change in agricultural drought risks.
