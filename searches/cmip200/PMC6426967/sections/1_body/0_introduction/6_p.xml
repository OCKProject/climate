<p id="Par7" class="p">Here, we use all available GCMs providing surface soil moisture outputs under the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5), which enable us to capture model uncertainty in the representation of climate sensitivity and climate process. We use all available representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios: RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 6.0, and RCP 8.5, which enable us to understand the uncertainty originating from unknown future greenhouse gas emissions and radiative forcing. We focus on agricultural drought and use soil moisture as an important indicator for agricultural drought. We analyze the raw GCMs outputs for surface soil moisture, instead of computing drought indices from related variables, which may introduce additional uncertainty. First, we investigate the multi-model ensemble (MME) annual and seasonal percentage change of surface soil moisture and evaluate the statistical significance of change using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test for each grid by controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) at a significance level of 0.05. Second, we calculate the duration, frequency, severity, and spatial extent of severe agricultural drought and analyze the spatial-temporal change of those drought characteristics. Third, we quantify and partition the three sources of uncertainty associated with these drought projections: internal variability, model uncertainty, and scenario uncertainty. Finally, we examine the spatiotemporal variability of annual and seasonal signal to noise (S/N) change in soil moisture anomalies across the globe and for different lead times to measure the magnitude of the expected change compared with the uncertainty in the projection.</p>
