<p id="Par13" class="p">CAM and EUM show the largest spread across emission scenarios, i.e., these regions respond very differently to different radiative forcing compared with other regions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). For those regions, the highest radiative forcing (RCP8.5) creates a much greater spatial extent of drought than the lowest radiative forcing (RCP2.6). By contrast, NAF, SAS, SEA, and CAF show the smallest spread resulting from different emission scenarios (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>), i.e., the spatial extent of drought in these regions is relatively insensitive to the differences in radiative forcing compared with other regions.
