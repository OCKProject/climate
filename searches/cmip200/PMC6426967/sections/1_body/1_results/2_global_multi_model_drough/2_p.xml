<p id="Par12" class="p">The global multi-model ensemble mean in the spatial extent of severe drought is projected to increase from approximately 11% for the period of 1976–2005 to 27% under RCP2.6, 29% under RCP4.5, 32% under RCP6.0, and 33% under RCP 8.5 for the period of 2071–2100 (Fig.

 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> shows the regional seasonal patterns of future drought projections in the RCP forcing compared with the historical forcing. The multi-model mean spatial extents of severe drought are projected to increase for all regions and all future RCP scenarios, with progressively larger spatial extent of severe drought as the strength of radiative forcing increases (RCP8.5 &gt; RCP6.0 &gt; RCP4.5 &gt; RCP2.6) in most cases. The increase in the spatial extent of drought tends to be larger in warmer seasons than cooler seasons in most regions. In southern hemisphere (TSA, SSA, AUS, and SAF), the largest increase in spatial extent occurs predominantly in the Austral Spring. The increase in the spatial extent of soil moisture deficit in high latitude regions (e.g. NAS) tends to be concentrated in the warmer season and diminished in the cooler season. The seasonal disproportionate change of soil moisture deficit is mainly because of changes in snow and ice. During the cooler season, the temperature increase tends to reduce the snow cover, increase the ratio of rainfall to snowfall, and drive earlier spring melting which limits soil moisture deficit, while during the warmer season, earlier spring melting coupled with higher evapotranspiration strengthen the soil moisture deficit

 </sup>. This mechanism leads to the seasonal disproportionate change in the spatial extent of drought in warmer months compared with the cooler months in high latitude regions.
