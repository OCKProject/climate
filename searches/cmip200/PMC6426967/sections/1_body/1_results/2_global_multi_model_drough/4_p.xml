<p id="Par14" class="p">We fit empirical CDFs of the global monthly spatial extent of drought for each individual model for the 360-month in the period of 1976–2005 (historical forcing) and the 360-month in the period of 2071–2100 (RCP forcing) to investigate both the mean change and temporal variability (inter-month variability) change (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). Most of the GCMs project increases in the spatial extent of severe drought, in which the RCP8.5 shows the largest increase. The MMEs under RCP forcing show very large inter-model uncertainty, in which RCP8.5 shows the widest range of projections, while RCP2.6 shows the narrowest range of projections, indicating that the projection uncertainty increases as the radiative forcing increases. This is true when the four RCP scenarios contain the same set of GCMs (not shown here). Furthermore, for each individual GCM projection under RCP forcing, in most cases, the CDFs, especially under RCP8.5, are flatter when compared with the CDFs using historical forcing, indicating greater temporal (inter-month) variability in the spatial extent of severe drought, i.e., more widespread drought and more extreme drought events.
