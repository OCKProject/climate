<p id="Par11" class="p">We calculate the drought characteristics: frequency of short-term drought (longer than or equal to 2 months and less than 6 months) and frequency of long-term drought (longer than or equal to 6 months) for the 30-year period of 1976–2005 (historical forcing) and 2071–2100 (RCP forcing) for each region (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2(a)</xref>). The multi-model median (shown in the boxplots) frequency of short-term drought is projected to increase by the end of the 21st century for most regions and for most RCP scenarios (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2(a)</xref>). In most cases, the increase in the frequency of short-term drought is higher for RCP2.6 than RCP8.5. There are several cases where the frequency of short-term drought is projected to decrease for the highest radiative forcing RCP8.5 compared to the historical period, such as Eastern North America (ENA), Europe and Mediterranean (EUM), South Africa (SAF), Tropical South America (TSA), and the global. This is because, in the RCP8.5 scenario, sequences of consecutive dry months are more likely, thus increasing the frequency of long-term drought and decreasing the frequency of short-term drought. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2(a)</xref> shows that the median frequency of long-term drought is projected to increase in most regions, with the greatest increase in EUM, TSA, Central America (CAM), ENA, and SAF, and the smallest increase in North Asia (NAS), South Asia (SAS), Central Africa (CAF), and North Africa (NAF). The highest radiative forcing shows the greatest increase in the long-term drought in most regions. However, as the boxplot show, the MMEs have a range that is much larger than the change (Fig.
