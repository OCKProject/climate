<p id="Par15" class="p">We calculate 30-year mean of the spatial extent of severe drought for the globe and for 15 regions for the period of 1976–2005 (historical forcing) and the period of 2071–2100 (RCP forcing) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). The model results from the same institution are similar and highly correlated (e.g. GISS-E2-R and GISS-E2-H, IPSL-CM5A-MR and IPSL-CM5A-LR, GFDL-ESM2M and GFDL-ESM2G) and those climate models developed by the same institution and sharing model components might have shared biases. The multi-model and multi-scenario mean spatial extent of CAM, EUM, TSA, and SAF are projected to increase the most, while the mean spatial extent of SAS, SEA, NAS, and CAF are projected to increase the least. We find that the variations of the spatial extent of drought across the 17 models (standard deviation: 10.4, unit: %) are much larger than the variations across the 4 RCP scenarios (standard deviation: 4.2, unit: %), i.e., the model spread is much larger than the scenario spread. Also, we find that the variations across the 17 models (standard deviation: 10.4, unit: %) are also larger than the variations across those 15 regions (standard deviation: 6.4, unit: %). Thus, the model difference is a significant contribution to the uncertainty of the future drought projections.
