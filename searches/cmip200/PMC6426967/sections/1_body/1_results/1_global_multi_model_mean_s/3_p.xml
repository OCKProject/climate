 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>). We have also detected a strong seasonality in many regions in the mid- and high-latitudes of the North Hemisphere, with wetting in the winter and drying in the summer (Supplementary Figs 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>) which is most likely due to increased temperature and evapotranspiration, increased precipitation throughout whole year, and earlier melting of ice and snow.
