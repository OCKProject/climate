<p id="Par8" class="p">We investigate future agricultural drought change by calculating the multi-model mean percentage change in annual/seasonal mean surface soil moisture for the period of 2071–2100 (RCP forcing) relative to 1976–2005 (historical forcing) for each emission scenario (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Percentage change is calculated because the magnitude of surface soil moisture varies by model; a 30-year period is chosen to sufficiently filter out interannual variability, but maintain multi-decadal variability. We also evaluate the statistical significance of change using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test, which is a nonparametric distribution-free paired-sample hypothesis testing procedure. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test is usually used as an alternative to paired two-sample student t-test when the assumption of normality is violated. Here, 9746 out of 29376 (33.18%) Shapiro-Wilk normality tests on a per-pixel basis reject the null hypothesis that the annual mean surface soil moisture from different GCMs for the period of 1976–2005 or the period of 2071–2100 are normally distributed at a significance level of 0.05. Thus, we perform a Wilcoxon signed-rank test (two-tailed) for each grid and each scenario by testing the null hypothesis that the distribution of the annual/seasonal mean surface soil moisture for different GCMs for the period of 1976–2005 (historical forcing) and the period of 2071–2100 (RCP forcing) are the same. A paired two-sample hypothesis test is used to control sources of variability in which the annual/seasonal mean soil moisture for the two 30-year periods from the same GCM is a matched-pair sample. An independent two-sample test is not appropriate in such cases. Moreover, since we perform multiple comparisons using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and calculate the p-values for more than 3000 grids for each scenario, we control for the false discovery rate (FDR) (i.e., the expected proportion of false discoveries among the total number of discoveries) for multiple comparisons at a significance level of 0.05 and adjust the p-value for each grid cell following the method of Benjamini and Hochberg
