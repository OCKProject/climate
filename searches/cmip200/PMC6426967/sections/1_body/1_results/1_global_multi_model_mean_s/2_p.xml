<p id="Par9" class="p">The annual mean surface soil moisture by the end of the 21st century shows statistically significant large-scale drying over most of Australia, South America, North America, southern Africa, Europe and Mediterranean, and east Asia, and statistically significant wetting in limited areas of east Africa, south Asia, and central Asia (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). The overall spatial patterns of drying and wetting are generally consistent across the four RCP scenarios, with stronger drying as forcing increases (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). The soil moisture drying in the Mediterranean, southwestern USA, northeast South America, and southern Africa is associated with projected widening of the Hadley Circulation that shifts downwelling and inhibits precipitation in these regions and globally increased temperature and evapotranspiration
