 </sup>, even if soil moisture is expressed in standardized anomaly format that already reduces the differences in soil moisture among models. The difference in the model response is the largest source of uncertainty (over 80%) over the entire 21st century. In the period before 2030, internal variability is the second largest source of uncertainty. After 2030, the scenario uncertainty exceeds internal variability and becomes the second largest source of uncertainty.
