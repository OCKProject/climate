<p id="Par18" class="p">The contributions to total uncertainty for the three drought statistics: 1-month drought occurrence, sum of severity, and spatial extent, all show similar patterns (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7(b–d)</xref>). The model uncertainty is always the dominant source of uncertainty during the entire 21st century. In the early period, the internal variability typically is the second largest source of uncertainty in the early half of the 21st century. By the latter half of the century, it is often exceeded by scenario uncertainty. Our finding that uncertainty in soil moisture projections is dominated by model differences contrasts with the uncertainty partition for global decadal annual mean temperature changes found by Hawkins and Sutton

 </sup>. In the case of global temperature, model uncertainty is relatively high in the early part of the century, but steadily falls and is exceeded by scenario uncertainty by the middle of 21st century. By the end, the scenario uncertainty accounts for approximately 82% of the total uncertainty and the model uncertainty accounts for 18%. Our results for soil moisture more closely approach the uncertainty in precipitation projections observed by Hawkins and Sutton

 </sup> wherein model uncertainty is the largest source of uncertainty over the entire 21st century. Of course, differences in modeled precipitation contribute greatly to simulated soil moisture differences. Yet, it is revealing that scenario uncertainty is so diminished despite the important role of temperature on evapotranspiration rates. Undoubtedly, uncertainty in simulated soil moisture values also results from the complexity of the water balance system and the model treatment of important factors, such as land use/cover, soil characteristics, landforms, vegetation, and evapotranspiration.
