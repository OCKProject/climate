 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6(a)</xref> shows time series of global decadal mean standardized soil moisture anomalies. We perform a Mann-Kendall trend test for the time series for each model and each scenario and we found that only model FGOALS-s2 in RCP2.6, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5 show a significantly positive trend, only model CESM1(CAM5) in RCP6.0 does not show a significant trend, and all other models in all four RCP scenarios show a significantly negative trend at a significance level of 0.05. Soil moisture is projected to decrease in the twenty-first century, with the strongest drying associated with the highest emissions scenario. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6(b)</xref> shows time series of global decadal sum of 1-month drought occurrence, representing the month counts in a 10-year moving window when soil moisture values fall below the 10th percentile of the historical simulation (1900–2005). Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6(c)</xref> shows time series of global decadal sum of severity, representing the sum of severity for all drought events in a 10-year moving window. The time series of decadal sum of 1-month drought occurrence and sum of severity show similar results, both are projected to increase over the 21st century with the highest increase for RCP8.5, and the lowest increase for RCP6.0 before mid-century and for RCP2.6 after mid-century. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6(d)</xref> shows time series of the global decadal mean spatial extent of severe drought, representing the global decadal mean percentage of areas experiencing severe drought conditions. The multi-model mean is projected to increase from approximately 10% during the 20th century to 26.5% (RCP2.6) and 35.2% (RCP8.5) by the end of the 21st century. Collectively, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref> shows that the spread of different models in response to the same radiative forcing (the spread of thin lines of the same color) is much larger than the spread of the different responses depending on the radiative forcing (RCP) (the spread of four thick lines) for the 21st century.
