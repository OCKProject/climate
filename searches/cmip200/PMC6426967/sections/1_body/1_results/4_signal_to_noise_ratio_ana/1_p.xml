<p id="Par20" class="p">We use the signal-to-noise ratio to measure how large the expected change of drought is compared to the uncertainty in the projections of drought. Understanding and modeling signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) for different regions could aid water resource planning. We quantify the signal as the change of soil moisture anomalies relative to the mean of the baseline period 1976–2005 and the noise as the square root of the total uncertainty (sum of internal variability, model uncertainty, and scenario uncertainty) in the projection

 </sup>. We calculate the S/N ratio for each pixel. We also examine the spatiotemporal variability of annual and seasonal S/N change across the globe and at different lead times (3rd decade, 6th decade, and 9th decade) (Fig.
