  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>
 </sup>. The S/N of temperature is far higher than that of soil moisture anomalies over all regions and all three lead times. The S/N of temperature peaks at the middle of the 21st century which is greater than 3 in the lower- to mid-latitude and even 4 in the tropics

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>
 </sup>. For precipitation, the highest wetting S/N is mainly shown in the high-latitude region. Over lead time, the high-latitude S/N of precipitation is increasing approximately from 1 to 2 and even larger than 2 but smaller than 3

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>
 </sup>. The drying S/N is mainly shown in the Mediterranean and Central America and the absolute value of S/N is increasing slightly from below 1 to above 1 over lead time
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>
 </sup>. Thus, the S/N of both temperature and precipitation are stronger than that of the soil moisture anomalies, with the S/N of temperature far stronger.
