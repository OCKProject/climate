<p id="Par21" class="p">By the end of the 21st century, the annual negative S/N occurs across the Mediterranean and Europe, in many parts in United States, Mexico, southern Africa, many parts of northern South America, Southeast China, and West Australia. However, the S/N is less than âˆ’1 in a very limited region of the Mediterranean and Europe, Southwest United States, and southern Africa. The S/N ratio for drying is stronger in the summer than the winter. The annual positive S/N are found in limited regions including mid- to high-latitude Asia, high-latitude North America, India, east Argentina, and Sahara, but no regions show S/N values greater than 1. Positive S/N are more commonly found in the winter than the summer, especially in mid- to high-latitude Asia, and high-latitude North America. The spatial patterns of S/N do not change too much through time; while the magnitude of S/N becomes slightly greater, it does not change significantly. This indicates that the spread of uncertainty becomes larger as the signal becomes stronger.</p>
