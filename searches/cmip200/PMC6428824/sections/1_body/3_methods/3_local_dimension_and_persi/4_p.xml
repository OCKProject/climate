<p id="Par22" class="p">When 
 <italic class="italic">x</italic>(
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>) contains all the variables of the system, the estimation of 
 <italic class="italic">d</italic> based on extreme value theory has a number of advantages over traditional methods (e.g. the box counting algorithm
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">38</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">39</xref>
 </sup>). First, it does not require to estimate the volume of different sets in scale space: the selection of 
 <italic class="italic">s</italic>(
 <italic class="italic">q</italic>) based on the quantile provides a selection of different scales 
 <italic class="italic">s</italic>, which depends on the recurrence rate around the point 
 <italic class="italic">Î¶</italic>. Moreover, it does not require the a priori selection of the maximum embedding dimension as the observable 
 <italic class="italic">g</italic> is always a univariate time-series.
