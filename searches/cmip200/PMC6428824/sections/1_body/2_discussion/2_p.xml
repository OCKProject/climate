<p id="Par15" class="p">It remains to explain why an increase in the temperature of the climate system, which corresponds to an increase in the Reynolds number for turbulent flows, could lead to more predictable states. For most of the flows, increasing the Reynolds number corresponds to an increase of the number of degrees of freedom. However, there are several examples of the opposite behaviour. A first example is the von Karman flow dynamics: Faranda et al.

 </sup> who analysed the jet stream dynamics using a low-dimensional model obtained by embedding the data. The bifurcation sequence, when increasing the control parameter (a surrogate of the Reynolds number), evolves from a high-dimensional noisy fixed point to a lower dimensional structure where the dynamics of the jet switches between blocked and zonal flows. Possible explanations of these phenomena of noise-induced order are investigated in the framework of stochastic dynamical systems
