<p id="Par14" class="p">We have shown that the atmospheric circulation’s intrinsic predictability in the North Atlantic has increased in the recent past, and will continue to do so in a future with continued high levels of anthropogenic emissions. The local dimension

 <sub class="sub">SLP</sub> appears to be the warmer (Atlantic) SSTs, which act to strengthen the zonality of the large-scale atmospheric flow and reduce the meridional patterns responsible for the more unpredictable situations. Warmer SSTs also correspond to more predictable atmospheric configurations, since
