<p id="Par16" class="p">Our conclusions come with some caveats. First, the ECMWF reanalyses do not show a decrease in dimensionality, but rather show either an increase of

Although the ERA20CM trend is compatible with those observed in some of the CMIP5 models, the CERA20C case is unique amongst the analysed data. We hypothesise that this may be due to the way the observations are assimilated into the reanalyses. For example, they are reinitialised every ten years, possibly leaving the ocean in an unstable transient state. Differences in oceanâ€“atmosphere coupling between the reanalysis datasets may also play an important role. Moreover, our analysis does not allow us to draw conclusions concerning the global circulation nor small-scale phenomena. Indeed, it relates more to the predictability of large-scale motions than to conventional weather predictability, although a relevant correlation between the variation of local dimensions and persistence and the spread in numerical forecasts of SLP fields exists

 </sup>. Finally, the validity of our results is restricted to the North Atlantic region, chosen because of the comparative abundance of observational data during the early reanalysis period. This is, however, also a strength of our methodology: the possibility of focusing on a specific region and scale by choosing the appropriate observable fields allows for future targeted studies addressing changes in predictability occurring, for example, in tropical or monsoonal regions, as well as analyses of the role of small-scale phenomena.
