<p id="Par4" class="p">Here, we diagnose predictability by relying on two objective metrics that sample the properties of the atmospheric attractor. Such metrics provide information on the number of active degrees of freedom of the system and on the typical timescales of the flow, and hence a measure of the intrinsic predictability of an atmospheric state. This is in contrast to predictability defined relative to the performance of a numerical weather prediction model. Computing such metrics was a major challenge until recently
