<p id="Par5" class="p">We specifically focus on evaluating changes in the intrinsic predictability of the atmospheric circulation over the North Atlantic under anthropogenic forcing, as represented by the above dynamical systems indicators. In the historical period, there is disagreement between reanalysis datasets. For the future period, most of the projections analysed here point to an increase in the atmosphere’s intrinsic predictability. The analysis of Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) simulations with 4 K warmer oceans and four times atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentrations points to the prominent role of a warmer ocean in driving this increase. We name this robust signal the hammam effect. This occurs through the enhancement of zonal atmospheric patterns, which are more predictable than meridional configurations.
