 <italic class="italic">d</italic> for the SST fields of some of the above datasets. Hereafter, we specify whether we are referring to

 <sub class="sub">SST</sub>. We do not adopt this notation for 
 <italic class="italic">θ</italic> as we compute it for the SLP field only. Finally, we note that the multi-model and ensemble-average 
 <italic class="italic">d</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">θ</italic> discussed below are not the metrics computed on the mean SLP fields, but rather the mean values of the metrics computed on the SLP fields of each model or ensemble member. This avoids introducing spurious trends in the data
