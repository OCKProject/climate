 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>
 </sup>. In simple terms, they describe the recurrences of a system around a state 
 <italic class="italic">ζ</italic> in phase space. In our case, 
 <italic class="italic">ζ</italic> would be a latitude–longitude map of a given variable for a given day and dataset. Values of 
 <italic class="italic">d</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">θ</italic>
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> are obtained for every time-step (i.e. every state 
 <italic class="italic">ζ</italic>) in the dataset of interest. 
 <italic class="italic">d</italic> provides information on how the system can reach 
 <italic class="italic">ζ</italic> and how it can evolve from 
 <italic class="italic">ζ</italic>, and is a proxy for the system’s active number of degrees of freedom. This information is intrinsically linked to the predictability of 
 <italic class="italic">ζ</italic>, but is local in nature. 
 <italic class="italic">d</italic> can change rapidly over timescales of a few days meaning that, when applied to atmospheric fields, it cannot be interpreted in the same way as the error of a medium-range weather forecast initialised from 
 <italic class="italic">ζ</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">θ</italic>
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> describes the persistence of 
 <italic class="italic">ζ</italic> in time. A very persistent state is typically highly predictable, while a very unstable state yields low persistence. In this sense, the information provided by 
 <italic class="italic">θ</italic>
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> is more directly linked to that provided by the error of a forecast initialised from

 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> therefore provide complementary information on the intrinsic predictability of an instantaneous state of the atmosphere. Details of how these two metrics are computed are provided in the Methods. We compute the above two dynamical systems metrics for the sea-level pressure field in the North Atlantic region (22.5°N–70°N and 80°W–50°E) for several datasets. These include the three longest reanalysis ensembles available over our domain, namely: the National Ocean and Atmosphere Administration’s (NOAA) atmospheric reanalysis of the twentieth century (20CRv2c)

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref> for the exact periods used in this study). The choice of region is motivated by the greater abundance of observations in the North Atlantic during the historical period than in other parts of the globe. The choice of SLP is similarly motivated by the fact that it is well constrained in the long reanalyses, as well as being representative of the main large-scale variability modes and atmospheric features of the North Atlantic region
