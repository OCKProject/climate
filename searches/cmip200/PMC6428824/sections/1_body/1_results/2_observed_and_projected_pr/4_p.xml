 </sup>. A shift of the upper and lower percentiles of the

 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> for the top and bottom five percentiles of the 
 <italic class="italic">d</italic>
 <sub class="sub">SLP</sub> distributions (see Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref>). We find that the trends are consistent with those found for the mean values, implying an enhanced zonality of the flow associated with a decrease in mean

 <sub class="sub">SLP</sub>. These results are also consistent with the dominant role of the summer and autumn seasons in the 
 <italic class="italic">d</italic> trends. Indeed, the summer NAO displays a long-term trend towards more positive values in the future, corresponding to an enhanced zonality of the flow

 </sup>, where a low-dimensional model of the jet dynamics over the northern hemisphere is derived. The authors found that the jet dynamics is sensitive to small shifts in a control parameter (the meridional temperature gradient) and that the dimension 
 <italic class="italic">d</italic> is proportional to the number of discontinuities of the jet (a proxy of blocking). Finally, the observed jet dynamics correspond to a region of the parameter space that is sensitive to perturbations, where small changes in the dimension correspond to large dynamical changes. In the dynamical system jargon, this means that the system is close to bifurcation points.
