<p id="Par10" class="p">We next discuss future climates using CMIP5 simulations run under the RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios, as well as the Community Earth System Model (CESM) RCP 8.5 large ensemble. The CMIP5 models show a significant decreasing trend in

 <sub class="sub">SLP</sub> throughout the period 1850–2100, albeit in some cases modulated by a marked inter-decadal variability. This trend is primarily associated with the summer (June–August, JJA) and autumn (September–November, SON) seasons (see Supplementary Fig.

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref> and
