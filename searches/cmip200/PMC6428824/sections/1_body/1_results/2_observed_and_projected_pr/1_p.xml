<p id="Par8" class="p">We first comment on the historical period and the reanalysis datasets (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). The absolute values of

 <sub class="sub">SLP</sub> and 
 <italic class="italic">θ</italic> for all datasets are reported in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>. The 20CRv2c ensemble shows a significant decreasing trend in 
 <italic class="italic">d</italic>
 <sub class="sub">SLP</sub>, whereas the inverse persistence increases only over the early period of the reanalysis, before stabilising. This is possibly an effect of the scarcity of observational data in the 19th century and the consequent large spread of the members

 </sup>. The ERA20CM and CERA20C reanalyses broadly agree with 20CRv2c in 
 <italic class="italic">θ</italic>, as they show a weak neutral and positive trend, respectively, but only cover the period where the 20CRv2c

 <sub class="sub">SLP</sub>: ERA20CM displays no significant trend, while CERA20C displays a significant increasing trend, opposite in sign to the significant decreasing trend seen in 20CRv2c. All three datasets also display large interdecadal fluctuations, with ERA20CM showing a lower variability than the other two. It is encouraging to note that, during the common period, CERA20C shows the same interdecadal variability as 20CRv2c; nonetheless, the discrepancy in the long-term 
 <italic class="italic">d</italic>
 <sub class="sub">SLP</sub> trends between the three reanalyses remains to be explained. The main difference between ERA20CM and CERA20C is the presence, in the latter, of data assimilation and a coupled ocean

 </sup>. To save computational time, it is common practice to restart the assimilation process of the reanalyses every 10 years

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">25</xref>
 </sup>. We speculate that this operation may affect the ocean dynamics because it does not give them time to settle on the attractor, as the trajectory is displaced every 10 years. On the contrary, it affects only marginally the atmosphere-only reanalyses without an active ocean component. This does not, however, explain the differences between ERA20CM and 20CRv2c, which must derive from differences in the numerical models and data assimilation schemes.
