<p id="Par9" class="p">The historical CMIP5 simulations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>) display a significant decreasing trend in 
 <italic class="italic">d</italic>
 <sub class="sub">SLP</sub>, whereas 
 <italic class="italic">θ</italic> shows an increasing, albeit very weak, trend. Unlike the reanalyses, CMIP5 data does not display large interdecadal fluctuations in the two dynamical quantities. This is partly due to the fact that, since we are considering a multi-model mean, the interdecadal fluctuations between individual members average out. However, even when individual historical model runs are analysed, the standard deviations of 
 <italic class="italic">d</italic>
 <sub class="sub">SLP</sub> and 
 <italic class="italic">θ</italic> are smaller than in 20CRv2c and CERA20C, and comparable to those of the ERA20CM dataset. These values increase to levels comparable to—or even exceeding—those of the two former datasets in the representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios.
