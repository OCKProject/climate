<p id="Par12" class="p">What could be the root driver of the above changes? To investigate this, we analyse two sets of forced AMIP simulations: the first with 4 × CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and the second with a 4 K warmer ocean. In the former, energy is injected immediately everywhere into the atmosphere, whereas in the latter the energy is stored in the ocean and may then affect the atmosphere through surface interactions. In the 4 × CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> runs, there is no significant change in

 <sub class="sub">SLP</sub> or 
 <italic class="italic">θ</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Therefore, the greenhouse enhancement does not appear to radically alter the dynamical properties of atmospheric motions. There is instead a significant change in the dynamical properties when the ocean is 4 K warmer. In this world, which one may imagine akin to a Turkish bath, or hammam, the local dimension decreases (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>) and the inverse persistence increases (not shown). An intuitive explanation for this phenomenon could be that a warmer ocean implies a stronger mid-latitude jet and the partial suppression of meridional patterns, such as blocking or Atlantic Ridges

 </sup>. This leads us to hypothesise that the long-term trends in 
 <italic class="italic">d</italic>
 <sub class="sub">SLP</sub> discussed above may be associated to changes in SSTs, with higher SSTs in the North Atlantic corresponding to lower local dimensions in the atmosphere. We confirm this inference by computing the local dimension of the SSTs from the subset of CMIP5 models that have both pre-industrial control and 4 K warmer ocean runs. We find a significant increase in the average

 <sub class="sub">SST</sub> across the warmer simulations, pointing to concomitant and opposite in sign variations in the atmospheric and oceanic local dimensions, at least in the models analysed here (Fig.
