 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> compares the distributions of several statistical properties of the Niño3.4 index in the different forcing regime ensembles. Standard deviation, an indicator of ENSO SST amplitude, is somewhat underestimated in the model. The observed 1940–1990 value is above the 95
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> percentile of the 1940–1990 ensemble. The distributions for each forcing regime have similar widths and sizeable overlap. CMIP5 and CESM Large Ensemble (LENS; discussion of the CESM ensemble below specifically refers to our low-resolution ensemble unless otherwise noted)

 </sup> distributions are also shown. CMIP5 distributions, sampling a mix of internal variability and model uncertainty, are wider than those of our CESM ensemble (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a</xref>). LENS, run at a higher resolution than our ensemble and sampling only different atmospheric initial conditions, exhibits distributions that are similar in width to those from our ensemble, though there is a noticeable increase in standard deviation under projected forcings.
