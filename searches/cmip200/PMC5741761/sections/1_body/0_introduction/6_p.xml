<p id="Par7" class="p">We examine ENSO in three different forcing regimes: constant pre-industrial forcing, 1940–1990 historical forcing, and RCP8.5 2040–2090 projected forcing. Each forcing regime ensemble has 50 independent members sampling ENSO’s natural modulations. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> shows the ENSO maximum entropy spectra for each forcing regime. Each ensemble exhibits considerable variety of spectral shape, with some members peaking around four years and others at less than two years, while the normalized power in those peaks can vary by greater than a factor of four. At the ensemble peak frequency, the power for individual members ranges from ~1/3 the median power to a factor of 2.5 greater than the median. The medians of each forcing regime ensemble, however, are similar in shape. While there are noticeable differences in the 95% confidence intervals of the ensemble means (e.g., a smaller peak in 2040–2090), the intervals overlap for much of the range (Supplementary Fig.
