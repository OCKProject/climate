<p id="Par16" class="p">The different responses to global warming in east and central Pacific ENSO may be related to a different balance of compensating effects in the two regions. To explore the existence of compensation, two key ENSO-related feedbacks, the negative heat flux and positive Bjerknes feedbacks, are analyzed in historical and projection time periods. The two feedbacks can be quantified as the slope of a linear regression of surface temperature anomalies with heat flux anomalies

 </sup>, respectively. We find an enhancement of the heat flux feedback and negligible change in the Bjerknes feedback in future projections (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S10</xref>). Changes in other feedbacks likely compensate for the enhanced negative heat flux feedback, such as positive thermocline feedback due to future shoaling of the equatorial Pacific thermocline
