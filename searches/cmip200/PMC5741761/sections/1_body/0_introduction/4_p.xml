<p id="Par5" class="p">Here, rather than using a multi-model approach that samples structural model uncertainty in the processes that govern ENSO, we analyze a large ensemble from a single model that performs reasonably well in simulating realistic ENSO-like behavior (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). The ensemble samples the internal variability of the coupled ocean-atmosphere-land-sea ice system, which we define as its year-to-year variations in the absence of time-varying greenhouse gas forcing. Our ensemble uses a low-resolution configuration of CESM (T31 × 3, described in the Methods section). Fifty individual ensemble members branch off at 100-year intervals from a fully-coupled, equilibrated, pre-industrial control simulation. Each member is then forced with historical values through 2005, then RCP8.5 until 2100. Because each ensemble member is identically forced after being initialized from its own unique starting point (corresponding to different times) in the equilibrated control, any differences between members are solely due to internal variability of the coupled climate system

 </sup>. This single-model approach, including both control and forced data, allows for comparisons of ENSO’s internal variability and response to climate change. The ensemble size allows for straight-forward and robust statistical assessment including quantile analysis, unlike smaller single-model assessments that use statistical estimators requiring key assumptions about stationarity or representativeness of a relatively short dataset (given ENSO’s decadal modulations)
