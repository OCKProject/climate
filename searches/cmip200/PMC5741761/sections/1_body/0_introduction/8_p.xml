<p id="Par9" class="p">Skewness roughly indicates the relative strength of El Niño and La Niña events. The observed 1940–1990 skewness is positive (El Niño events are generally stronger than La Niña), and closely matches the CESM ensemble median over the same time period. Similar to standard deviation, there is sizeable overlap between the CESM forcing regime ensembles (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b</xref>). The CESM ensemble distributions are again comparable for El Niño and La Niña event counts (as defined in the Methods section) (Fig.
