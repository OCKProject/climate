 </sup>. ENSO can be characterized with the Niño3.4 index, the climatological SST anomaly in the Niño3.4 region of the equatorial Pacific (outlined in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). El Niño (La Niña) events correspond to a positive (negative) Niño3.4 index, with the strength of the event tied to the magnitude of the temperature anomaly (e.g., Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref>). Several ENSO metrics can be derived from the Niño3.4 index time series: the spectrum reveals the frequency distribution of events, skewness roughly measures the relative strength of El Niño and La Niña events, and the standard deviation is tied to ENSO SST amplitude. In observations and simulations, ENSO events display considerable diversity, including variations in geographical location and seasonal evolution. Methods used to assess this diversity include, among others, SST indices that emphasize different location centers

 </sup>. Analyses of ENSO-related feedbacks, for example the Bjerknes positive feedback between zonal winds and SST, are key to understanding ENSO mechanisms and evolution in the real world. These feedbacks also allow detailed assessment of model representations of ENSO and provide a useful framework to investigate possible ENSO changes in the future
