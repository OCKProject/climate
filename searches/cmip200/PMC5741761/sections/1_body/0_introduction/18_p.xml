<p id="Par19" class="p">In summary, we use an ensemble framework that allows explicit estimation and comparison of ENSO’s coupled internal variability and response to different forcing regimes. In this CESM ensemble, we find that the effect of climate change on model eastern Pacific ENSO SST is secondary to natural modulations, while central Pacific ENSO amplitude significantly decreases, to an extent comparable with natural modulations. The primary role of internal variability here highlights its importance to investigations of ENSO’s climate change response. Earth system model ensembles such as this one, that adequately sample the coupled ocean-atmosphere internal variability, can be used to estimate the model ENSO’s internal variability and its potential non-stationarity. This approach enables a robust assessment of the modeled ENSO’s response to radiative forcing, as well as its detectability in the presence of internal variability.</p>
