<p id="Par12" class="p">For an explicit analysis of ENSO evolution, we also examine the continuous record of 20-year running ENSO statistical properties. Individual simulations under both pre-industrial and climate change forcings exhibit ENSO SST amplitude (i.e., Niño3.4 index standard deviation) modulations comparable with those in the observations, and the spread due to these modulations is roughly constant through time. Modulations of ENSO skewness larger than those in the observations occur under both pre-industrial and climate change forcings. Over the combined historical and projection time period, any ensemble change in either statistical property is negligible compared with natural modulations (Fig.
