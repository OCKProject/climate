Earth system modeling approaches that capture the effect of natural variability, or more precisely the variability within the coupled system in the absence of time-varying external forcing, can be used to characterize the importance of internal variability when considering potential anthropogenic climate trends

 </sup>. This type of approach is especially useful for ENSO, which undergoes decadal modulations that have hindered even qualitative projections of potential amplitude change in the coming decades.
