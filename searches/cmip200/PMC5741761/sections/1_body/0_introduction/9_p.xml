<p id="Par10" class="p">Given approximate normality (see Q-Q plots in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S7</xref>), we perform two-sided t-tests comparing the pre-industrial ensemble mean with that of the 2040–2090 ensemble mean for each statistical property. None of the differences are significant at 95% confidence, even given adequate detection sensitivity allowed by this large dataset (e.g., we could have rejected the hypothesis of equal means for a change in standard deviation greater than ~4%) (Supplementary Table
