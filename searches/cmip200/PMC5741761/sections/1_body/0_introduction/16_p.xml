 </sup>. The single run of CCSM4 in CMIP5 undergoes a decrease in amplitude that is much larger than our estimated internal variability, and the decrease occurs across the Niño3 and Niño4 regions

 </sup>. Analysis of this decrease and changes in other CMIP5 models shows that ENSO’s response to global warming may be tied to the mean state response of eastern equatorial Pacific meridional flow

 </sup>. Changes in mean state meridional flow affect ENSO meridional structure, with larger mean poleward motion associated with a wider ENSO structure and lower amplitude. Indeed, the CCSM4 meridional ENSO structure widens in projections, while high-resolution CESM becomes slightly narrower, and our CESM ensemble ENSO structure undergoes a relatively slight widening (Supplementary Fig.

 </sup>. The increased ENSO amplitude in LENS could be related to changes in the mean meridional flow, however, it may also be related to the ensemble set-up. Unlike our ensemble, which samples unique initial conditions of the fully-coupled climate system, each member of LENS is initialized with the same ocean state in 1920, differentiated only by atmospheric perturbations. Therefore, the ensemble does not fully sample ocean internal variability. The significant ENSO amplitude increases in the early decades of LENS may be related to this issue
