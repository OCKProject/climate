<p id="Par18" class="p">A large single-model forced ensemble allows both high-sensitivity investigation of ENSO’s changes due to forcing, as well as robust estimates of ENSO internal variability. As earlier noted, analyses of long control simulations have shown that several hundred years are required to sufficiently sample ENSO modulations under a given forcing

 </sup>. We pose a related question: how many ensemble members are necessary to provide adequate sampling of internal variability of ENSO 50-year metrics? Given approximate normality of the ensemble distribution of a 50-year metric (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S7</xref>), its internal variability can be described by the standard deviation of that distribution. Then, deciding the appropriate size of an ensemble to assess natural modulations is essentially deciding the appropriate number of samples from a normal distribution to assess its standard deviation. Sampling without replacement from our 50 control ensemble members, we calculate the sample standard deviation of ENSO amplitude (i.e., Niño3.4 index standard deviation) as a function of ensemble size (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>). Ensembles with less than ~20 members will poorly assess internal variability of 50-year averaged metrics. Using the full ensemble, internal variability estimates for all three forcing regimes (0.061 °C, 0.067 °C, and 0.070 °C for control, 1940–1990, and 2040–2090, respectively) are much larger than the magnitude of the ensemble mean amplitude change (−0.003 °C from control to 2040–2090). The internal variability of 50-year EMI standard deviation is roughly constant in all three forcing regimes (0.026 °C, 0.027 °C, and 0.026 °C for control, 1940–1990, and 2040–2090, respectively) and comparable with, though less than, the ensemble mean decrease (0.041 °C from control to 2040–2090, Supplementary Table
