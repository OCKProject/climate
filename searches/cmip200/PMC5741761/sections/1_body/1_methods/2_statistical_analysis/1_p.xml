<p id="Par23" class="p">We focus on SST in the Niño3.4 region, (5°S-5°N, 170°-120°W). We calculate a Niño3.4 index as the monthly average SST climatological anomaly in the region. To isolate ENSO variability from long-term warming, a 211-month triangle smoothing is subtracted from the index time series (as in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> of Wittenberg, 2009). The resulting trend-removed Niño3.4 index time series has no warming trend. There are differences in the trend time series between ensemble members, meaning that some amount of internal variability is lost with this method. However, the differences in the trends are about an order of magnitude smaller than the differences between trend-removed indices (Supplementary Fig.
