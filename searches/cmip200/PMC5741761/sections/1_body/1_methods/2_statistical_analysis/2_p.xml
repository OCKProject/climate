 </sup> for each trend-removed time series. In order to visually isolate the ENSO peak, the spectrum is normalized by frequency. With the maximum entropy technique, the shape of the spectrum is sensitive to the order of the autoregressive fit, as determined using the Akaike Information Criterion. For example, maximum entropy spectra for ERSST v3b and HadISST v1.1

 </sup> are notably different, even though they are produced from almost identical index time series (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S14</xref>). We repeat our spectral analysis using a fast Fourier transform, which involves no smoothing of the time series, and basic results are unaffected (Supplementary Figs

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S6</xref>).
