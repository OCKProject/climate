<p id="Par21" class="p">We first completed a ~4000-year equilibration simulation with pre-industrial forcings, allowing the deep ocean to reach near-dynamic equilibrium. After equilibration, the control simulation continues for another 5000 years. We initialize 50 different climate change simulations from the equilibrium pre-industrial control at 100-year intervals after the 4000-year spin-up. Each simulation is initiated from its own unique snapshot of the coupled atmosphere-ocean-land-sea ice system. These 50 simulations run from 1850â€“2100, using historical anthropogenic and natural forcings between 1850 and 2005 and RCP8.5 from 2006 to 2100
