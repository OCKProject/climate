<p id="Par22" class="p">We further break up the ensemble into three different analysis periods: 1940–1990 representing current climate conditions, 2040–2090 representing future climate conditions (corresponding to RCP8.5), and 50 different 50-year time slices sampled from the pre-industrial control simulation. Thus, we have three ensembles that sample the internal variability in three different forcing regimes. Repeating the analysis with longer time sections did not change our results (not shown).</p>
