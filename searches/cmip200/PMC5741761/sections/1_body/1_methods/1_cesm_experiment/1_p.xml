 </sup>. The CAM4 atmospheric model component is configured with a spectral resolution of ~3.75° × 3.75° and 26 vertical levels. The ocean model component has a nominal horizontal resolution of 3° (changing to less than 1° near the equator) and 60 vertical levels. While this configuration of low-resolution CESM has several climate biases, analysis of a similar configuration of CCSM4 along with our own analysis show that it captures tropical Pacific inter-annual temperature variability associated with ENSO and other properties related to ENSO
