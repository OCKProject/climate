Hence, the health risk assessment of future climate change could aid in improving the design of public health interventions and policies, preparedness of adaptation strategies, and healthcare planning. Numerous studies have assessed the heat-related mortality risks of future climate change in developed countries, but few were performed in developing countries where health vulnerability to climate change is greater [
