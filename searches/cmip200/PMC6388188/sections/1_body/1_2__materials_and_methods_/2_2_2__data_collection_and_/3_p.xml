<p class="p">Future daily temperature data projected using 27 GCMs under three RCP scenarios were collected from Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project 5 (CMIP5) (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijerph-16-00376" class="xref">Table S1</xref>) [
 <xref rid="B1-ijerph-16-00376" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B21-ijerph-16-00376" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. A single ensemble was used for each GCM model. We chose RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 scenarios to represent the low, middle, and high greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, respectively. Because GCMs often provide biased simulated temperature which are usually at coarse spatial resolution [
 <xref rid="B22-ijerph-16-00376" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>], we employed three bias-correction models (
 <italic class="italic">unbiasing</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">qqmap</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">isi-mip</italic>) to downscale the projected temperature data to a finer spatial resolution of 0.5 °C × 0.5 °C [
 <xref rid="B23-ijerph-16-00376" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>], in which the daily TM data of 680 meteorological stations during 1960–1999 in China [
 <xref rid="B24-ijerph-16-00376" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>] was used as a training dataset. We finally selected the results derived from 
 <italic class="italic">isi-mip</italic> as input for projection as it outperformed the other two methods (
