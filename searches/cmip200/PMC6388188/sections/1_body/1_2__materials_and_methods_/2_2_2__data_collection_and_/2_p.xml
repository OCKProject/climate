<p class="p">Historical daily meteorological data, including daily mean temperature (
 <italic class="italic">TM</italic>), relative humidity (
 <italic class="italic">RH</italic>) and wind speed (
 <italic class="italic">WS</italic>), for the 1980s and for 2010–2015 in Guangzhou, were collected from the Guangdong Provincial Meteorological Bureau. The 1980s were chosen as our modeling baseline because this decade is at the center of the conventional climatological baseline period from 1971 to 2000, which was also employed in several previous studies [
 <xref rid="B19-ijerph-16-00376" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="B20-ijerph-16-00376" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. The 
 <italic class="italic">YLLs</italic> estimated during the baseline period were subtracted from heat-related 
 <italic class="italic">YLLs</italic> for future periods. Meteorological data during the 2010–2015 were used to assess the exposure-response relationship between high temperature and YLLs in Guangzhou, because these data are the most updated and hence can be matched to the most recent census data in 2010.
