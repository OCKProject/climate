<p class="p">Based on equation (1), a healthy temperature range (
 <italic class="italic">TM</italic>) of 12.6–21.0 °C, within which the heat effects were not statistically significant, was identified. A temperature of 21.0 °C was defined as the threshold temperature, and all the cumulative effects (
 <italic class="italic">YLLs</italic>) of temperature above 21.0 °C along lag 0–1 days were defined as heat effects. Similarly, we defined the heat effect threshold temperature in males (24.3 °C), females (21.5 °C), and people &lt;65 (28.5 °C) and ≥65 years (elderly) (18.6 °C).
