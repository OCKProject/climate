<p class="p">Our study comprehensively quantified the heat-related 
 <italic class="italic">YLLs</italic> of future warming climate under the RCP scenarios on a local scale in China, observing an escalation of heat-related 
 <italic class="italic">YLLs</italic> under all scenarios in the 21st century. The heat effects may increase dramatically with continued rapid population expansion processes and population ageing in the future. However, the adaptation increase would partially offset the heat-health effects. Therefore, it is necessary to design and implement more effective response strategies and measures in the future to reduce the heat risk in highly populated urban areas, by reducing heat exposure in all populations, improving their adaptation, and targeting most efforts on the elderly.
