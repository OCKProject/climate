<p class="p">After considering adaptation, we found that heat-related 
 <italic class="italic">YLLs</italic> would be largely counteracted under adaptation S1 (8.92% decrease per decade) and S3 (0.2 Â°C increase in MMT per decade) scenarios, but less modified under adaptation S2 scenario (4.60% decrease per decade) for the total population. For example, 78.0%, 77.9%, and 74.4% of heat-related 
 <italic class="italic">YLLs</italic> under high population expansion scenarios in the 2030s could be offset by adaptation (S1) under the RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively, and the figures declined to 14.7%, 14.8%, and 14.1%, respectively, under the adaptation S2 scenario. Furthermore, the heat-related YLLs could also be subsequently offset by adaptation in the 2060s and 2090s (
