<p class="p">During the 2030s, when the population will reach its peak, comparing with the scenario of constant population size at the 2010 level, we observed a more rapid increase in heat-related YLLs from low, medium to high population expansion under all climate change scenarios if the adaptation was constant. Each 10% increase in population expansion level was associated with an average of 4.23, 4.23, and 4.29 thousand more 
 <italic class="italic">YLLs</italic> under the RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively, in the 2030s (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijerph-16-00376" class="xref">Table S4</xref>). For the 2060s, we observed a similar trend in heat-related 
 <italic class="italic">YLLs</italic> as the 2030s from low, medium to high expansion scenarios, but the 
 <italic class="italic">YLLs</italic> under the low expansion scenario were lower than the constant expansion scenario. In terms of the 2090s, 
 <italic class="italic">YLLs</italic> under low as well as medium expansion scenarios are smaller than the constant expansion scenario, but the changing trend in 
 <italic class="italic">YLLs</italic> from low, medium to high expansion is consistent with the 2030s and 2060s. One of the major reasons for the 
 <italic class="italic">YLL</italic> decrease is a decrease in population size under the low and medium scenarios.
