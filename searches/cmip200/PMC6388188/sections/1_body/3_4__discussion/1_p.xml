<p class="p">Climate change is not only a significant environmental issue, but also a serious public health challenge that may continue to grow as the planetary temperature increases. In this study, we found that heat-related 
 <italic class="italic">YLLs</italic> in Guangzhou, China would dramatically increase under all climate change scenarios and most GCMs as the 21st century progresses. This finding was consistent with those of some previous studies. For example, in comparison with the 1980s, Li et al. identified that cardiovascular mortality in Beijing under the RCP8.5 scenario would increase by 16.6%, 73.8%, and 134.0% in the 2020s, 2050s, and 2080s, respectively [

These findings highlighted the potential public health benefits that could result from the scenario of lower GHG emission, and the critical importance of adequately adapting to climate change to protect vulnerable populations if we cannot reverse the trend of global warming in the near future.
