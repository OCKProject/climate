<p class="p">Projecting future adaptation to heat is an important challenge in assessing the heat-related mortality of climate change. In previous studies, methods used to account for adaptation included analogue cities, analogue summers, and assuming adaptation to heat for a pre-determined number of degree Celsius [

 <xref rid="B7-ijerph-16-00376" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. In addition, the adaptation may vary along with the process of climate change. For example, more intensive warming process may enhance peopleâ€™s adaptive capacity. Therefore, we employed three adaptation scenarios in this study to assess uncertainties of offset effects of adaptation on heat-related 
 <italic class="italic">YLL</italic> estimations. Of the three scenarios, two were assessed based on the past declines in vulnerability to temperature, and one was based on pre-determined change in temperature units of degrees Celsius. We observed that the adaptation S1 scenario would bring larger offset effects than the other two scenarios. The adaptation S1 scenario might be the most accurate trajectory for people in Guangzhou in the future. We believe that these estimates of heat effects derived from a broad range of scenarios provides uncertainty information for policy makers concerned with adaptation planning for climate change and health.
