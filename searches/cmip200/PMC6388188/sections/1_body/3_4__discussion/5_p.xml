<p class="p">Our results further revealed that adaptation would significantly offset the future heat effects, which was consistent with previous studies’ findings. For instance, Jenkins et al. observed that increasing the temperature threshold by 1 °C could result in declines in annual heat-related mortality ranging from 32% to 42% across the scenarios in London in the 2050s [

For example, properly designed infrastructure can provide physical protection; well-designed communications and early warning systems can help people to respond and cope with heat waves; and appropriate urban planning including land-use changes, building regulations, external shading, green space increase, and GHG mitigation can reduce heat exposure and hence help to reduce heat impacts.
