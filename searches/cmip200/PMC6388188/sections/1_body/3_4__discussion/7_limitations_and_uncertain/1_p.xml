<p class="p">Some other limitations and uncertainties should be acknowledged in this study. The first source comes from the projection of population expansion. Although we have thought over the uncertainty, and employed a probabilistic model in our projection, we ignored the variation of vulnerability to temperature between immigrants from other places and the residents in Guangzhou because we could not project the age and gender structures of these immigrants. However, rural residents in China are more vulnerable to high temperature than urban residents, due to such factors as greater age, lower education, lower incomes, and less access to high quality medical care. Second, we did not adjust for other air pollutants such as O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>, CO, and PM
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>
 <sub class="sub">.5</sub> in the DLNM because of lack of data, which may have led to potentially biased exposure-responses between temperature and 
 <italic class="italic">YLLs</italic>. However, previous studies have demonstrated that the effects of air pollutants would be smaller than temperature, and did not significantly alter the effect sizes of temperatures [
 <xref rid="B50-ijerph-16-00376" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. Furthermore, some air pollutants such as O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> might be on the causal path between temperature and health, which can also complicate interpretation of adjusted models. Thirdly, we observed weaker associations of TM with YLLs in males and younger people. For example, the YLLs were significantly increased for people &lt;65 years when TMs were larger than 28.5 Â°C, which may lead to underestimation of the heat effects. Another source of uncertainty is that we did not address the cold-related YLLs, although the reduction of cold-related mortality due to the warming climate change may partially offset the heat-related YLLs. Uncertainties may also come from some other sources, such as possible changes in humidity, air quality affected by climatic factors, health conditions of people, profile of the heatwave, intraurban variation of temperatures and risks, and changing of land-cover, building environments, quality and type of building stock, and population density. These uncertainties are expected to be included in future studies, and thus moving towards a more comprehensive risk-type framework that explicitly represents uncertainty in the assessment.
