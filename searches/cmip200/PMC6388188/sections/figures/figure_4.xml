  <p class="p">Impacts of population expansion and adaptation on the annual heat-related 
   <italic class="italic">YLLs</italic> in the future. Constant adaptation: People’s adaptation to high temperature will remain constant at the 2010 level. Adaptation S1: People’s adaptation to high temperature will increase by 8.92% per decade. Adaptation S2: People’s adaptation to high temperature will increase by 4.60% per decade. Adaptation S3: People’s adaptation to high temperature will increase by 0.2 °C per decade. C: The population size will remain constant at the 2010 level. L: Low population expansion scenario. M: Medium population expansion scenario. H: High population expansion scenario. The three rows of panel show the effects of population expansion and adaptation on the heat-related 
   <italic class="italic">YLLs</italic> in 2030s, 2060s, and 2090s, respectively. The heat-related 
   <italic class="italic">YLLs</italic> in the future have been subtracted by the heat-related 
   <italic class="italic">YLLs</italic> in the 1980s.
