<p class="p">These results highlight the large uncertainty in future TC tracks and the impact those tracks could ultimately have on storm-surge heights at the Battery. Additional research should investigate more thoroughly the relationship and potential compensation between increases in storm intensity and offshore track shifts of TCs impacting the Battery under future scenarios.</p>
