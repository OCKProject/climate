 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sfig05" class="xref">S5</xref> indicate annual means of the TC variables on the plot, revealing potential changes in TC variables over time. However, each year includes more than 100 storms. As can be seen from quantiles plotted in the background of these figures, the annual distributions of some of these variables include large tails, which are relevant when considering the evolution of TC characteristics at the Battery over time.
