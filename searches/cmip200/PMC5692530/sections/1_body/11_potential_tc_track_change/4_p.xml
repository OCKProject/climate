<p class="p">The minimum distance calculations include only a magnitude, not a direction. Thus, it is possible to have a shift in storm tracks that would not be apparent in the minimum distance variable. For example, a storm with a track that takes it 50 km to the west of the Battery would have the same minimum distance value as a storm with a track that traveled 50 km to the east of the Battery. Although there would be a spatial shift in this example, it would not show up in the minimum distance calculations. However, all of the core models consistently show more westerly winds at the Battery over time. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the spatial shift is not apparent in the minimum distance time series that extend only to 2100 (MPI and CCSM4), but, as the tracks continue to shift throughout time, the shift is eventually substantial enough to be reflected in the minimum distance values in the IPSL time series that extends to 2300, with later tracks presumably moving farther east than their more westerly counterparts from earlier in the time series.</p>
