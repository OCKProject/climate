<p class="p">As noted in the main text, this work investigates only a small “core” set of CMIP5 models, consistent with those used in ref. 
 <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>, in an attempt to investigate future changes to flood risk in NYC in the context of the historical analysis presented in that study. Although the core models all seem to indicate, to varying degrees, a shift in TC tracks away from the Battery in NYC, there is a great deal of uncertainty associated with modeling future TC tracks. The inclusion of additional models in future work may help to provide a more complete understanding of expectations for TC track behavior under future climate simulations.
