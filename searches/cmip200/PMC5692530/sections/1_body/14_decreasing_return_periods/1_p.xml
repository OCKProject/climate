 <xref ref-type="table" rid="st01" class="xref">Table S1</xref> details the changing return period of a 2.25-m flood height throughout time as an average across the core models for the various SLR scenarios we consider here. We calculate the average return period of a 2.25-m flood height across our core models for 10-y intervals, in an effort to estimate the time period in which such a flood becomes a 1-in-10-y event and a 1-in-5-y event. Note that, because of differing methodology in the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 SLR scenarios compared with the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 SLR scenarios that include the AIS contributions from ref. 
 <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>, there are some differences in the time periods of when the 2.25-m flood height reaches various return-period thresholds. However, despite differing methodology, there is still a 5-y overlap in the time periods presented here between the various SLR scenarios, increasing confidence in the approximate timeline indicated in the main text.
