<p content-type="flushleft" class="p">As noted in the main text, tides can be very important in determining overall flood heights, although we do not account for a full tidal cycle in our calculations. The impact of the tidal cycle on any given flood height is dependent upon the time at which the peak surge occurs within the tidal cycle; thus, the size and speed of individual TCs play a large role in determining how much of an impact tides have on a given flood height. For example, it is far more likely that a storm-surge event will overlap with a high tide in the case of large, slow-moving storms such as Hurricane Sandy, compared with smaller storms moving through the region more quickly. Thus, the influence of tides upon overall flood heights will vary greatly from storm to storm; however, we can contemplate idealized examples that allow us to consider the potential impact of tidal cycles on flood heights in a general sense.</p>
