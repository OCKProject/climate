<p class="p">Let us consider a TC with a diameter of âˆ¼500 km. Suppose that the translation speed of this TC in the midlatitudes is about 40 km/h. If we assume a track for the TC such that the storm produces onshore winds in a given location for the length of the storm (500 km), we find that the storm could produce on-shore winds for about 12.5 h, making it almost certain that this idealized TC would produce a surge that coincides with a high tide if we assume a tidal cycle of about 12 h. This example portrays a highly idealized situation; however, it illustrates potential for tides to have significant influence upon overall flood heights, and indicates that many of our results may be somewhat conservative since we do not incorporate tides into our analysis.</p>
