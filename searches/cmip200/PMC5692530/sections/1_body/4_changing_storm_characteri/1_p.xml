These three models (henceforth “core models”) were also used in ref. 
 <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>; thus, we can provide a preindustrial context for results presented here. We also consider changes to TC characteristics, including trajectories and wind speeds, for storms downscaled from four additional models (HadGEM, GFDL, MRI, and MIROC; henceforth “additional models”) that include the necessary output to generate synthetic storms in future simulations (
