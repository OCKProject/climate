<p class="p">We suggest that changing TC tracks exert an important influence on future storm-surge heights in NYC (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>). In the core models, tracks move offshore between 1980–2000 (during the modern era) and 2080–2100 (during the future era). This is also true for tracks from the IPSL model in 2280–2300. The largest increase in track density (∼0.025) occurs offshore between ∼38–41 °N and ∼69–74°W; the Battery tide gauge is located at 40.7 °N, 74.015 °W. Four further metrics support the shift in TC track densities (
