<p class="p">As with any study involving GCMs, our results are subject to limitations related to the accuracy of modeled atmosphericâ€“ocean dynamics, which drive the behavior and tracks of downscaled TCs. Of particular relevance is the limited skill of CMIP5 models in simulating the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) and Arctic sea ice loss (

 <xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>). Although CMIP5 models generally project a weakening of the AMOC by 2100, the degree of weakening varies greatly across individual models (
