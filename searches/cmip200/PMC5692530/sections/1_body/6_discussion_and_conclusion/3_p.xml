<p class="p">In particular, underestimation of AMOC weakening may lead to an underestimation of the anomalously cool sea-surface temperatures that have been observed south of Greenland in the North Atlantic (

Such high-pressure patterns could block TC paths to the north, directing more TC tracks toward NYC (similar to the path that Hurricane Sandy took in 2012). Moreover, a southerly bias in projections of the Gulf Stream path due to an underestimation of AMOC weakening could also reduce the number of TC tracks reaching NYC (
