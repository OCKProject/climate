<p content-type="flushleft" class="p">We downscaled RCP8.5 simulations of three CMIP5 models to examine storm-surge heights and TC characteristics. There is minimal change or slightly increased storm-surge return periods (i.e., reduced risk) at the Battery tide gauge between modern and future time periods. Although there is a tendency for the strongest storms to strengthen with warming, storm tracks shift offshore at the latitude of NYC, offsetting the effects of increased storm intensity on storm surges at the Battery. However, stronger storms with shifted tracks could lead to more direct or severe TC impacts in other coastal regions, such as New England or northwestern Europeâ€”an issue that merits further study. We note that a climate with stronger storms opens the possibility of a rare and very damaging event to the NYC region, even if such storms are typically routed away from the area.</p>
