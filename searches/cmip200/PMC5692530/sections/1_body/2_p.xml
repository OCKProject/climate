The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) projected a “likely” (&gt;66% probability) global-mean sea-level rise (SLR) of 52–98 cm by 2100 relative to 1986–2005 in a high-emissions future [Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenario (
 <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>)] and indicated a global-mean SLR of 1 to &gt;3 m by 2300 with medium confidence (
 <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>). However, AR5 projections of SLR are limited by uncertainties surrounding the response of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets (
 <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>). AR5 projected a likely contribution of the Antarctic ice sheet (AIS) of −8 to 15 cm under RCP8.5 by 2100, but a coupled ice sheet and climate dynamics model that includes marine ice-sheet instability, ice-shelf hydrofracturing, and marine ice-cliff collapse mechanisms suggests that the AIS could contribute more than 1 m by 2100, and more than 10 m by 2300, under RCP8.5 (
