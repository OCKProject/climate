 <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>) found that, during the preindustrial period (850–1800), the average 500-y return period flood height across models was ∼2.25 m MTL at the Battery. Using a preindustrial-era baseline for sea level, the 500-y flood height increases to between 3.3 and 3.7 m MTL in all core models (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06" class="xref">Fig. 6</xref>) during the modern period (1970–2005). For simulations from 2080 to 2100, the mean 500-y flood height relative to the preindustrial baseline sea level is 4.0–5.1 m MTL (
