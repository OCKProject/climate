<p class="p">Relative SLR at NYC is likely to be greater than the global mean, due primarily to the combined effects of glacial isostatic adjustment and the static-equilibrium fingerprint of AIS mass changes (

 <xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>). Under RCP8.5, relative SLR for NYC will very likely (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.90) be 0.55–1.4 m (median of 0.96 m) between 2010 and 2100 and 1.5–5.7 m (median of 3.2 m) between 2000 and 2300. Our projections increase to 0.88–2.5 m (median of 1.5 m) and 10.7–15.7 m (median of 12.7 m) for 2100 and 2300, respectively, for the enhanced AIS input scenario (
