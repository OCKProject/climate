<p class="p">The return period of the 2.25-m flood height decreases dramatically over time. The 2.25-m flood height has a return period of ∼500 y during the preindustrial era, which decreases to less than ∼25 y during the modern period. In 95% of simulations, the return period of such a flood decreases to ∼5 y between 2030 and 2045 (
