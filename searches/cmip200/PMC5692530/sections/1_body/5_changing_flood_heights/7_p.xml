<p class="p">Increases in future NYC flood heights have also been found in a number of previous studies (
 <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>). However, our inclusion of SLR scenarios that incorporate large contributions to SLR and overall flood heights from the AIS results in greater increases in flood heights at the Battery by the end of the 21st century than earlier studies. Although there is deep uncertainty in the contributions of the AIS to SLR, the potential for large contributions should not be neglected in risk assessment.
