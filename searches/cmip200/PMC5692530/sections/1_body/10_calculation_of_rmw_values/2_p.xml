<p class="p">Here, scaling of the outer radius remains the same for both the modern and future climates. There is some evidence from theory and from somewhat idealized models that the outer radius becomes systematically larger as the climate warms (
 <xref rid="r50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>); thus, as noted in the main text, we may induce a low bias in RMW values by keeping the scaling of the outer radius the same in simulations of storms in the future climate as in the modern climate. For example, if we were to assume a 10% increase in RMW values under future climates (
 <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>), we find that changes in storm wind profiles result in an âˆ¼5% increase in future wind speeds at the Battery across our models, compared with wind speeds from profiles calculated using the original RMW values (
