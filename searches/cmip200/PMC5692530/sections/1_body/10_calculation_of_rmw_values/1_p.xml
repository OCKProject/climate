<p content-type="flushleft" class="p">The basin mean value of storms’ outer radius is applied in this study to all storms. The outer radius is defined here as the distance from the storm center at which the azimuthal component of the surface wind (associated with the storm) vanishes. It is typically about 400 km but varies greatly among individual storms. However, it usually does not vary much during the lifetime of any particular storm (
