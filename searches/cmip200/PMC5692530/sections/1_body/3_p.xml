<p class="p">We assess NYCâ€™s coastal flood risk over the next three centuries based on a combination of synthetic TCs, storm-surge models, and probabilistic SLR projections (
 <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>). The estimated flood risk does not account for the influence of the tidal cycle. Although TC and SLR projections out to 2300 have less confidence, we use them to illustrate the possible evolution of flood risk in NYC beyond the end of the current century.
