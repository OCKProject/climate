<p class="p">Considering increasing flood risk from 2010 to 2300, survival functions show that a typical 90th-percentile flood event is projected to increase from a 2.4-m flooding event in the modern era in the IPSL model to a 4.6-m event for the RCP 4.5 SLR scenario and to a 9.8-m event for the RCP 8.5 SLR scenario with the AIS contribution from ref.

The 99.9th-percentile flood event is projected to increase from a 4.4-m flooding event in the modern era to a 13-m event during the 2010–2300-time period for the RCP 4.5 SLR scenario and to a 19-m event during the 2010–2300-time period for the RCP 8.5 SLR scenario with the AIS contribution from ref.
