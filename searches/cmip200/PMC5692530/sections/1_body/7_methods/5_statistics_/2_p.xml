<p class="p">We use PCA to analyze variations and patterns between TC characteristics and storm surge. In addition, we examine LAFs to compare modern and future return periods. We define the LAF of a variable as the ratio of the variableâ€™s future value to its modern value for a given return period; it indicates the degree to which the variable increases or decreases in the future compared with the modern era.</p>
