<p class="p">We focus our study at the Battery in NYC. Storm-surge heights and flood heights are given relative to MTL, or the arithmetic mean of mean low water and mean high water at the Battery tide gauge over the present National Tidal Datum Epoch (1983–2001). The Battery tide gauge from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) tide gauge network indicates that (
 <italic class="italic">i</italic>) the present great diurnal range (GT, the height difference between mean higher high water and mean lower low water) is 1.54 m, (
 <italic class="italic">ii</italic>) the present mean tidal range is 1.38 m, and (
 <italic class="italic">iii</italic>) the height difference between spring and neap tides is typically ∼0.5 m.
