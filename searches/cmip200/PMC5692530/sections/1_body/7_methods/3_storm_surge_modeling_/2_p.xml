<p class="p">Consistent with previous work, storm surge is defined here as the anomalous rise of water above MTL, and flood height is defined as the sum of storm surge and change in relative sea level (
 <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>). Storm-surge height is primarily determined by a TCâ€™s wind patterns and track, coastal geography, and, to some extent, the reduced atmospheric pressure associated with a storm. Storm-surge heights are thus highly dependent upon the TCs that generate them, as they are significantly affected by TC characteristics, including intensity, size, duration, and location (

 <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>). The effect of changes in wave setup for the region is expected to be small and is not included in our storm-surge calculations.
