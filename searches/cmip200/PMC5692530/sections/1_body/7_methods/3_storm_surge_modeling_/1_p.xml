<p class="p">As in ref. 
 <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>, we apply the Advanced Circulation (ADCIRC) model (
 <xref rid="r52" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>) to simulate the storm surges induced by all synthetic storms. ADCIRC is a finite-element hydrodynamic model that has been successfully used to simulate and forecast storm-surge events for coastal regions (e.g., refs. 
 <xref rid="r53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref> and 
 <xref rid="r54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>). The numerical grid and modeling specifics used here were developed by Lin et al. (
 <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>) and used in refs. 
 <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>.
