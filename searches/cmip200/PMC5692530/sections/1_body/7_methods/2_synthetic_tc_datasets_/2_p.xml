<p class="p">Preindustrial-era TC and storm-surge datasets referred to here are the same as the preanthropogenic datasets described in ref. 
 <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>, and the modern-era surge and TC datasets referred to here are the same as the anthropogenic datasets used in ref. 
 <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>. Note that preindustrial and modern datasets contain âˆ¼5,000 storms for each model. For reliable statistical analysis of future storm-surge heights in this region we use datasets that include more than 12,000 storms per century with centers that pass within 250 km of the Battery. Overall event frequency is calculated from the ratio of the total number of simulated TC events to the total number seeded.
