  <p class="p">Quantileâ€“quantile plot of modern and future TC minimum pressure. Results are shown for MPI (magenta), CCSM4 (green), and IPSL (cyan) models from 2010 to 2100 and for the IPSL model from 2010 to 2300 (blue); pressure is considered at the time when each storm achieves its minimum distance from the Battery. The dashed line indicates the line 
   <italic class="italic">y</italic> = 
   <italic class="italic">x</italic>. Points that deviate from this line indicate that the two distributions being compared differ from one another.
