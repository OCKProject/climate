  <p class="p">Multimodel mean difference between future and modern synthetic TC track densities from the MPI, CCSM4, and IPSL models. Track densities are determined by the sum total of tracks crossing through each grid box over 20-y periods from 2080–2100 and 1980–2000, divided by the area of that grid box and the number of years (
