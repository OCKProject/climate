<p class="p">To quantify the impacts of VPD on GPP, we further explored GPP sensitivity to climate variables (i.e., air temperature, VPD, and radiation), atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration, and satellite-based NDVI/fPAR (see Materials and Methods; 
 <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 6B</xref>). Two satellite-based models showed the similar GPP sensitivity to VPD, whereby global GPP decreased by 13.82 ± 3.12 Pg C and 18.29 ± 3.65 Pg C with a VPD increase of 0.1 kPa (
 <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 6B</xref>), which is comparable to the GPP increase with a 100–parts per million (ppm) rise of atmospheric [CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>] (i.e., β
 <sub class="sub">CO2</sub> = 19.01 ± 4.01 Pg C 100 ppm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>). On the basis of the estimated GPP sensitivity, we estimated the contributions of climate variables, CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fertilization, and vegetation index to global GPP over the two study periods (table S2). After the late 1990s, VPD increased by 0.0017 ± 0.0001 kPa year
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> according to the CRU dataset (fig. S1), which resulted in GPP decreases of 0.23 ± 0.09 Pg C year
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and 0.31 ± 0.11 Pg C year
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> according to the EC-LUE and MODIS models, respectively (
 <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 6C</xref> and table S2). The VPD-induced GPP decreases partly counteract the CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fertilization effect (0.38 ± 0.08 Pg C year
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) after the late 1990s with the rising rate of atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration by 2.02 ± 0.01 ppm year
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. From 1982 to the late 1990s, CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fertilization played a dominant role in the GPP increase (
 <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 6C</xref>). According to the EC-LUE model, GPP increases of 0.28 ± 0.15 Pg C year
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> occurred because of the rising atmospheric [CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>] (
 <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 6C</xref> and table S2).
