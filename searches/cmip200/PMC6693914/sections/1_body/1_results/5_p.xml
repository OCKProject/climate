<p class="p">Partial correlation analysis indicated significant correlations of detrended VPD with detrended NDVI and LAI when the impacts of air temperature, radiation, and atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration were excluded (
 <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>). Detrended NDVI over 62% of the vegetated areas shows a negative correlation with detrended VPD (about 14% with a significant negative correlation) (
 <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 5A</xref>). Similarly, four detrended satellite-based LAI correlated negatively with detrended VPD over 65 to 70% of vegetated areas (16 to 22% with a significant negative correlation) (
 <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 5, B to E</xref>). In addition, all five satellite-based datasets show highly consistent signs of correlation with VPD, and at least three datasets revealed consistently negative correlations with VPD over 72% of vegetated area (
 <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 5F</xref>). A machine learning method [i.e., random forest (RF)] was used to reconstruct NDVI based on atmospheric [CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>] concentration and five climate factors (air temperature, precipitation, radiation, wind speed, and VPD) over the last 34 years in each pixel (fig. S7) and then model experiments were applied to separate the impacts of VPD as well as of other variables (see Materials and Methods). Globally, the model experiments suggest that the atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration, air temperature, and VPD are the most important contributors for the variability of NDVI (fig. S8A). Rising VPD was found to significantly decrease NDVI, indicated by the larger negative NDVI differences from 1999 to 2015, suggesting that substantial increases of VPD strongly limited NDVI (fig. S8B).
