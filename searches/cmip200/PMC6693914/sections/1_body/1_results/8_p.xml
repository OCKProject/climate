<p class="p">We further investigated the impacts of VPD on LUE using measurements of global EC towers (see Materials and Methods; table S3). Because VPD correlated strongly with air temperature, we excluded the effects of air temperature to investigate the impacts of VPD by binning the observations for ranges of air temperature. We binned the LUE data for different restricted ranges of air temperature and found strong negative correlations between VPD and LUE for almost all air temperature ranges (fig. S9 and table S3). In addition, we investigated the impacts of VPD on vegetation growth using a global comprehensive dataset of tree-ring width measurements from 171 locations with temporal coverage from 1982 until at least 2005. Partial correlation analysis showed that the detrended VPD derived from the four datasets correlated with detrended tree-ring width at most sites (56 to 72%) when the impacts of air temperature, radiation, and atmospheric CO

We compared the differences of mean tree-ring width values between before and after 1998 and observed smaller tree-ring widths after 1998 compared to those before 1998 at 64% of sites (25% sites with significant level) (fig. S10E).
