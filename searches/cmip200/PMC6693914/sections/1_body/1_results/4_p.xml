 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 3</xref> illustrates that the satellite-based NDVI substantially increased from 1982 to 1998 (

 <italic class="italic">x</italic> − 1.86, 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.43, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05), while NDVI remained constant and then stalled after 1999 (

 <italic class="italic">x</italic> + 1.23, 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.06, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.65) (
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 3A</xref>). From 1982 to 1998, approximately 84% of the vegetation surface showed an increased NDVI trend (28.50% with a significant increase; 
 <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 4A</xref>). In comparison, after 1999, the trends of NDVI over many regions reversed, and 59% of vegetation areas showed a pronounced NDVI browning (decreasing) trend (21.50% with a significant decrease; 
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figs. 3B</xref> and 
 <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). Mean NDVI trends for 12 months after 1999 were lower than those from 1982 to 1998 over globally vegetated areas (
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 3C</xref>). Moreover, we analyzed long-term trends of LAI based on four global LAI datasets [Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS), GLOMap, LAI3g, and Terrestrial Climate Data Record (TCDR); table S1] (
 <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">25</italic>
 </xref>). Despite the large variability of the estimated interannual LAI among the four products, all four LAI datasets exhibited a transition from increasing trends before the late 1990s to decreasing trends afterward (fig. S5). The LAI showed a decreasing trend since the late 1990s over vegetated areas of 64.72, 72.62, 62.73, and 80.11% for GLASS, GLOMap, LAI3g, and TCDR datasets, respectively (fig. S6). The differences of NDVI and LAI trends during these two periods are the opposite of VPD trends derived from four VPD datasets.
