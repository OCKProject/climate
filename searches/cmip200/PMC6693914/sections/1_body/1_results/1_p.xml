<p class="p">This study used four observation-based globally gridded climate datasets—CRU (Climatic Research Unit), ERA-Interim, HadISDH, and MERRA (Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications) (table S1)—to analyze the long-term trend of VPD over vegetated land. Similar to previous analyses (

 </xref>), anomalies in all four datasets showed that VPD trends were temporally and spatially heterogeneous over recent decades (

It was observed that VPD increased slightly before the late 1990s but increased more strongly afterward with 1.66 to 17 times larger trends according to the four datasets (fig. S1). The datasets showed that 53 to 64% of vegetated areas experienced increased VPD trends since the late 1990s (fig. S2). To illustrate the magnitude and spatial variability of VPD change, we calculated the global pattern of the percentage change of annual growing season mean VPD between two periods of 1982–1986 and 2011–2015 (fig. S3A). On average, the annual growing season mean VPD of 2011–2015 was 11.26% higher than that of 1982–1986, and the VPD increased larger than 5% in more than 53% area. In addition, the increases of global mean VPD over 12 months were positively correlated with the mean VPD values of 1982–1986 at more than 64.5% areas (fig. S3B), which implies that the higher VPD increases in the months with high VPD.
