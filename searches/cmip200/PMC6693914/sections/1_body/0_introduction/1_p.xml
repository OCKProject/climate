<p class="p">Vapor pressure deficit (VPD), which describes the difference between the water vapor pressure at saturation and the actual water vapor pressure for a given temperature, is an important driver of atmospheric water demand for plants (

  <italic class="italic">1</italic>
 </xref>). Rising air temperature increases saturated water vapor pressure at a rate of approximately 7%/K according to the Clauius-Clapeyron relationship, which will drive an increase in VPD if the actual atmospheric water vapor content does not increase by exactly the same amount as saturated vapor pressure (SVP). Numerous studies have indicated substantial changes of relative humidity (ratio of actual water vapor pressure to saturated water vapor pressure) not only in continental areas located far from oceanic humidity (
