<p class="p">Changes of VPD are important for terrestrial ecosystem structure and function. Leaf and canopy photosynthetic rates decline when atmospheric VPD increases due to stomatal closure (

 </xref>). Increasing VPD notably affects vegetation growth (

 </xref>), and maize yields (

 </xref>). In addition, rising VPD greatly limits land evapotranspiration in many biomes by altering the behavior of plant stomata (

 </xref>). Given that the global precipitation is projected to remain steady (
 <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">16</italic>
 </xref>), the changing VPD and soil drying would likely constrain plant carbon uptake and water use in terrestrial ecosystems (
 <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">17</italic>
 </xref>). However, the large-scale constraints of VPD changes on vegetation growth have not yet been quantified. In this study, we determined the changes in VPD trends through observation-based global climate datasets, and then quantified the impacts of these VPD changes on vegetation growth and productivity, using satellite-based vegetation index [i.e., normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)] and leaf area index (LAI), tree-ring width chronologies, and remotely sensed estimates of gross primary production (GPP).
