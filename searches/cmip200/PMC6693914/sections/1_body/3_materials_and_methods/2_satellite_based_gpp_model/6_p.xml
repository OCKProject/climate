<p class="p">We performed two types of experimental simulation to evaluate the relative contribution of three main driving factors: CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fertilization, climate change, and satellite-based NDVI/fPAR changes. The first simulation experiment (S
 <sub class="sub">ALL</sub>) was a normal model run, and all drivers were set to change over time to examine the responses of GPP to all environmental changes, including climate, atmospheric [CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>], and NDVI/fPAR. The second type of simulation experiments (S
 <sub class="sub">CLI0</sub>, S
 <sub class="sub">NDVI0</sub>, and S
 <sub class="sub">CO20</sub>) allowed two driving factors to change with time while holding the third constant at an initial baseline level. For example, the S
 <sub class="sub">CLI0</sub> simulation experiment allowed NDVI and atmospheric [CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>] to change with time, while climate variables were held constant at 1982 values. S
 <sub class="sub">NDVI0</sub> and S
 <sub class="sub">CO20</sub> simulation experiments kept NDVI and atmospheric [CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>] constant at 1982 values and varied the other two variables.
