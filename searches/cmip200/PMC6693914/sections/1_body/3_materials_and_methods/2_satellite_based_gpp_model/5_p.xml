 <sub class="sub">0</sub> were calibrated using estimated GPP at EC towers (table S7). The nonlinear regression procedure (Proc NLIN) in the Statistical Analysis System (SAS; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) was applied to estimate the three parameters in the revised EC-LUE model. The revised EC-LUE model was calibrated at 50 EC towers and validated at 41 different towers (table S3). The results showed good model performance of the revised EC-LUE model for simulating biweekly GPP variations (fig. S13). To estimate global GPP, EC-LUE and MODIS models used the MERRA dataset (i.e., air temperature, VPD, PAR). Because of the different model algorithm, GIMMS3g NDVI and fPAR products were used to indicate vegetation conditions for EC-LUE and MODIS, respectively.
