<p class="p">The RF model was driven by all variables (climate and atmospheric [CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>]) changing over time (RF
 <sub class="sub">ALL</sub>), and two factorial simulations of NDVI (RF
 <sub class="sub">CO20</sub> and RF
 <sub class="sub">CLI0</sub>) were produced by holding one driving factor (climate or atmospheric [CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>]) constant at its initial level (first year of data) while allowing the other driving to change with time. The RF
 <sub class="sub">CLI0</sub> simulation experiment allowed atmospheric [CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>] other than climate variables to vary since 1982. RF
 <sub class="sub">CO20</sub> simulation experiments kept atmospheric [CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>] constant at 1982 values and varied the climate variables. At each pixel, we selected 33 years of NDVI observations out of the total 34 years (1982–2015) to develop the RF model, and the remaining 1 year of NDVI observations was used for cross-validation. The model was run 34 times to ensure that the data of each year can be selected to do model validation. The simulated NDVI of three model experiments (i.e., RF
 <sub class="sub">ALL</sub>, RF
 <sub class="sub">CO20</sub>, and RF
 <sub class="sub">CLI0</sub>) are mean values of all 34 times simulations. The simulated NDVI only from the validation year constitutes the RF
 <sub class="sub">VLI</sub> dataset, which was used to examine the performance of random forest for reproducing NDVI. The simulated NDVI of RF
 <sub class="sub">VLI</sub> matched the GIMMS3g NDVI very well (fig. S7), and the correlation coefficient (

 <sup class="sup">2</sup>. The relative predictive errors range from −1.2 to 1.04% globally and imply that the RF model can accurately simulate interannual variability and magnitude of NDVI.
