<p class="p">A machine learning method (i.e., RF) was used to model the effects of VPD on NDVI. RF combines tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector that is sampled independently, with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. We constructed RF models for simulating annual growing season mean NDVI at each pixel driven by air temperature, precipitation, radiation, wind speed, atmospheric [CO
