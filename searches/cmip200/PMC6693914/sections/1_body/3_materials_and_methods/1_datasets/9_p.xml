<p class="p">This study conducts the partial correlation analysis between VPD and tree-ring width by excluding the impacts of air temperature, radiation, and atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration. Air temperature and PAR from MERRA dataset were used. For atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration, this study used the GLOBALVIEW-CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> product, which provides observations of atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration at 7-day intervals over 313 global air-sampling sites (
 <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">43</italic>
 </xref>). If missing 7-day data accounted for &gt;20% of all data for an entire year, then the value for that year was indicated as “missing.” For a site to be included in this study, it had to have at least 10 years of observations. Eventually, 77 sites were included equally in the calculation of global monthly mean CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration without any weighting of individual sites.
