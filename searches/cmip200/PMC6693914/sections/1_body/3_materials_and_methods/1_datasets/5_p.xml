<p class="p">We used the newest release of the advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) NDVI to indicate vegetation growth from 1982 to 2015. The AVHRR is a nonstationary NDVI version 3 dataset made available by NASA’s Global Inventory Modeling and Monitoring Study third-generation dataset (GIMMS3g) group (

 </xref>). GIMMS3g contains global NDVI observations at approximately 8-km spatial resolution and bimonthly temporal resolution, derived from AVHRR channels 1 and 2, corresponding to red (0.58 to 0.68 μm) and infrared (0.73 to 1.1 μm) wavelengths, respectively. Each 15-day data value is the result of maximum value compositing, a process that aims to minimize the influence of atmospheric contamination from aerosols and clouds. Moreover, this study analyzed long-term trends of LAI based on four global satellite LAI products (table S1): GLASS (version 4) (
