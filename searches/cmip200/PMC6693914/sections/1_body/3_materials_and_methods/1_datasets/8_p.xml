<p class="p">The tree-ring width measurements around the world were used from the International Tree-Ring Data Bank (ITRDB) (
 <xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">42</italic>
 </xref>). The wood samples were taken and processed following standard protocols and taking two radial cores per tree at 1.3 m. Tree-ring width measurements were detrended and standardized by the scientists who contributed the chronologies to the ITRDB. Each local chronology represents the average growth of several trees (typically more than 10) of the same species growing at the same site. The temporal span of the tree-ring data series selected began at 1982, lasting at least until 2005. Eventually, 171 sites were analyzed and each chronology of the sites is a representation of annual tree-ring width.
