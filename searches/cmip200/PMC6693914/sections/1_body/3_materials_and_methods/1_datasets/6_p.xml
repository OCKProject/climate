<p class="p">We calculated the annual growing season mean NDVI and LAI by averaging monthly NDVI and LAI values with monthly mean temperatures above 0°C. We also calculated multiyear averaged monthly mean temperatures from the CRU dataset to ensure that the same growing season land mask was used over the entire period (1982–2015). The global mean NDVI and LAI values were calculated by the average of the annual growing season mean NDVI and LAI, excluding unvegetated regions. The MODIS land cover type product (MCD12Q1) was used to identify the vegetated regions.</p>
