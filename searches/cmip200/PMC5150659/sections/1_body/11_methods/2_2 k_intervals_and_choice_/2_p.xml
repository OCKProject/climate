<p class="p">End-of-century results, for 2 K (Mit) and 4 K–2 K (Mit) are all averaged over the 30-year period 2071–2100. Thus, the averaged mitigation scenario (mean of RCP2.6 and RCP4.5) involves a mean over 60 years of data. This 60-year mean has relatively low noise from internal variability. This is important for this period in particular as it is used in both 2 K (Mit) and 4 K–2 K (Mit). So, in principle, noise from internal variability could disproportionately affect their difference (shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2e</xref>). The small differences seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2c</xref> suggest that internal variability is not large. For 2 K (Fast), RCP8.5 is averaged over the 60-year period, 2011–2070. For 2 K (Mit) and 2 K (Fast), anomalies are taken with respect to the 30-year pre-industrial period 1861–1890 (an additional historical period is used in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Figs 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">4</xref>—see below). This means that internal variability has a similar magnitude in each of the three 2 K intervals (each is a difference between a 30-year mean and a 60-year mean).
