<p class="p">Second, we ensure that the internal variability in each pair of 2 K intervals being correlated is statistically independent. This is necessary to avoid bias in the correlation between these variables. Therefore, when comparing the two routes to a first 2 K (left column of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Figs 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">4a</xref>), different historical periods are used for 2 K (Fast) and 2K (Mit) (1861-1890 and 1911-1940 respectively). For the same reason (ensuring independent variability), 4 K–2 K (Mit) is compared with 2 K (Fast) in the right column of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Figs 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">4b</xref>. Swapping the two historical periods in this analysis has no effect on the conclusions drawn from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Figs 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">4a</xref>: only minor changes in the pattern in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4a</xref> are seen.
