<p class="p">Results show annual mean precipitation from 25 CMIP5 models (listed in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). A single initial value ensemble member is used from each model, for each of four simulations: the pre-industrial control, and the RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 projections. Results from all models were regridded to a common 2.5Â° grid. Data are converted to anomalies with respect to the pre-industrial control mean before analysis.
