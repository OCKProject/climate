 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" class="xref">22</xref>. For example, precipitation has both fast responses to forcing (via reduced tropospheric radiative cooling and rapid land surface warming) and slower indirect responses (via sea-surface temperature warming)

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" class="xref">24</xref>. Patterns of surface warming (and hence precipitation change
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3" class="xref">3</xref>) can also evolve over time (for example, warming over the Southern Ocean lags global mean warming
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" class="xref">21</xref>). These effects, therefore, are sensitive to the forcing history. If forcings have been changing rapidly (such as under RCP8.5), then fast responses are relatively important, as they adjust quickly to the recent forcing changes. If, on the other hand, forcings have been stabilised for some time (such as under RCP2.6 or RCP4.5 by the end of the century), slower responses have had more time to develop, so play a relatively larger role. Linear mechanisms can alter both global mean precipitation and global climate feedbacks significantly
