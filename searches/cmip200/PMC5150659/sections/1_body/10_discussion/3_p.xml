<p class="p">There are also potential implications for quantitative policy tools using pattern scaling
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6" class="xref">6</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7" class="xref">7</xref>, which by definition assume the patterns of climate change for each K of global warming are approximately constant. Some ensemble mean scenario dependence of precipitation change patterns has previously been shown
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8" class="xref">8</xref>, notably in the RCP2.6 extension to year 2300. Some differences in spatial patterns stand out more clearly in the current study due to the use of longer-term means, and because we study the second 2 K of warming independently of the first 2 K (the second 2 K is relevant to mitigation advice). Relative changes in precipitation patterns per K of global warming shown here are significantly larger than for temperature
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" class="xref">12</xref>. Some techniques already exist to improve pattern scaling. Attention has focused on aerosol forcing
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9" class="xref">9</xref>, and on linear mechanisms (the latter, by adding greenhouse gas forcing
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9" class="xref">9</xref> or land-sea contrast
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10" class="xref">10</xref> as additional predictors alongside global warming, or by using response function methods
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" class="xref">12</xref>). A time-shifting method also exists
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10" class="xref">10</xref> that could reduce error from some nonlinear mechanisms. This method could perform better if effects from non-greenhouse gas forcings and linear mechanisms are first removed (for example, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2e</xref> of ref. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10" class="xref">10</xref> shows errors over China that are consistent with aerosol forcing). The most appropriate method will be application-dependent, according to the region, scenario and time-period studied and on the magnitude of internal variability, which depends on the time-averaging period chosen.
