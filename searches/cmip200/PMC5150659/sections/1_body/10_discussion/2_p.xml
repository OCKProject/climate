 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31" class="xref">31</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36" class="xref">36</xref> points to a challenge in better understanding the underlying physical mechanisms, with implications for how observations are used to improve parameterisations of cloud, convection and other rainfall processes. There may be some links to the nonlinear mechanisms identified previously
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" class="xref">12</xref> for surface warming. In particular, effects related to change in the Bowen ratio over the west Amazon and tropical Africa
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" class="xref">12</xref> could plausibly play a role in results in similar regions in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4c</xref>. Behaviour of seasonal mean rainfall and other climate variables will be investigated in future. There is an opportunity, in the forthcoming CMIP6 for comparing responses to abrupt2 × CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (part of CFMIP) and the conventional abrupt4 × CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. It is hoped that this experiment will see widespread engagement of the climate modelling community, alongside experiments targeting other forcings, such as aerosol and land-use change.
