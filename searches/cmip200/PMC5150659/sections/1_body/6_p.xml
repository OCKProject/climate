<p class="p">Nonlinear mechanisms are those inconsistent with linear system theory. These may include state-dependent feedbacks, such as the sea-ice albedo feedback (which vanishes for large or zero sea-ice cover

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" class="xref">12</xref>. For example, if an equivalent of RCP8.5 was run with double the forcing, linear mechanisms would show exactly double the response compared with the standard RCP8.5, but nonlinear mechanisms would not. Nonlinear mechanisms have been demonstrated in a few models for very high-forcing levels

Nonlinear behaviour of the Indian Summer Monsoon associated with the positive moisture advection feedback has also been proposed
