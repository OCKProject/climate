<p class="p">We include results for all CMIP5 models which simulate all of RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 (25 models; 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). The same time periods are taken from each climate model, to ensure that they each experience the same forcing history. Hence, individual models may show global mean warming greater or &lt;2â€‰K. Specific averaging periods are given in Methods. We analyse ensemble mean patterns first, then explore the inter-model differences.
