<p class="p">These two routes to a first 2 K have different warming and forcing histories (compare yellow and blue lines in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>). As a result, they may show different precipitation patterns due to linear mechanisms (that is, from different timescales of response). Further pattern differences may arise because the mid-century aerosol burden in 2 K (Fast) is higher than that at the end of the century—in 2 K (Mit).
