<p class="p">The differences between the two routes to a first 2 K are uncorrelated (across models) with the differences between a first 2 K and a second 2 K. We show this by calculating, at each location, two differences for each model: (2 K (Mit)−2 K (Fast)) and (4 K–2 K (Mit)−2 K (Fast)). At each location, we calculate the correlation between these two differences across the 25 models. Over 99% of the land area,

This result is consistent with the idea that different mechanisms are highlighted by these two differences: primarily linear mechanisms and aerosol when comparing the two routes to a first 2 K; and nonlinear mechanisms and possibly land-use for the second 2 K versus a first 2 K.
