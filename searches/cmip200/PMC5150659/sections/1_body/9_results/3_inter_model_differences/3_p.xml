<p class="p">The regional mean results in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref> are broadly typical of other regions, especially in the tropics (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4a–c</xref>). Our primary result here is in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4c</xref>: over most, but not all regions, the two routes to a first 2 K are more strongly correlated with each other than with the second 2 K response. The correlation coefficients often differ by a factor of 2 or more (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4c</xref>). This suggests that in many regions the balance of mechanisms driving model differences for a second 2 K may be different than that for a first 2 K, but further investigation of specific mechanisms is required.
