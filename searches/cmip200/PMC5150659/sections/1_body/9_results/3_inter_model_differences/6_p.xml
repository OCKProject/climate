<p class="p">At mid-latitudes, correlation coefficients are generally lower, even in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4a</xref>. This is probably an artefact of internal variability: the ratio between internal variability and inter-model spread in precipitation change is larger here than in the tropics
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39" class="xref">39</xref>. For this reason, we focus on the ratios in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4c</xref> rather than the absolute values in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4a,b</xref>.
