<p class="p">This is indeed the case when the two routes to a first 2 K are compared over the Western Amazon (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3a</xref>). However, a rather weaker correlation is found (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3b</xref>) when 4 K–2 K (Mit) is compared with 2 K (Fast). That is, inter-model differences in precipitation change over this region look similar for the two routes to a first 2 K, but different for the second 2 K. Hence, the main physical reasons for the model differences over the Western Amazon may be different for warming from 2 K to 4 K than for a first 2 K. A similar picture is seen over Western Africa—one of the most densely populated areas of Africa (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3c,d</xref>). For this region, both the inter-model differences and the ensemble mean are quite different for 4 K–2 K (Mit) than for a first 2 K. Both nonlinear mechanisms and land-use change could influence these results, but a strongly nonlinear precipitation response to CO

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31" class="xref">31</xref>. In contrast, inter-model differences are rather similar for all three 2 K intervals over East Africa (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3e,f</xref>). This is consistent with the hypothesis that inter-model disagreement in this region is caused by similar physical mechanisms for all three 2 K intervals. These regions were chosen just to illustrate the range of behaviours. Other regions also show differences in inter-model spread between different 2 K intervals.
