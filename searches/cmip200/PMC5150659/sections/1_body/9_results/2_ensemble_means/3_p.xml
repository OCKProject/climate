<p class="p">The effects of linear mechanisms on these results (that is, on 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2e,f</xref>) should be relatively small. The forcing history for 4 K–2 K (Mit) is similar to that for the first 2 K under RCP8.5 (compare red and orange lines in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1b,c</xref>). Therefore, the contribution of linear mechanisms to 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2e</xref> should be similar to their contribution to 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2c</xref>. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Figure 2c</xref> shows this to be a relatively small effect. In other words, if only linear mechanisms were important, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2c,e</xref> would be similar. Aerosol effects may largely be excluded because aerosol forcing is small relative to pre-industrial levels in all RCPs at the end of the century.
