<p class="p">In contrast, the end-of-century response to a second 2 K, 4 K–2 K (Mit), is rather more distinct (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Figure 2e</xref> shows the difference in response between this second 2 K of warming, and the first 2 K under mitigation. These differences are much larger than those shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2c</xref>. Positive values are more common at low latitudes and negative values at mid-latitudes, including southern South America. This is not a small effect: over large areas of the land surface the responses for these two 2 K intervals differ by a factor of 1.5 or more (values &gt;3/2 or &lt;2/3 in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2f</xref>).
