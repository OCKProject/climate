 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Figure 2g</xref> also shows ratios between precipitation change under a second and a first 2 K of warming (as 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2f</xref>), but just for the RCP8.5 scenario (for the second 2 K under RCP8.5, divided by the first 2 K under the same scenario). Away from China, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2g</xref> is similar to 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2f</xref>, with slightly smaller magnitudes, due to a different effect of linear mechanisms (arising from different forcing histories).
