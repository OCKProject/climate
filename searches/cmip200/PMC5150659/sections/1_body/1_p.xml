<p class="p">Stakeholders need information, not just about global mean warming but on likely regional-scale climate changesâ€”especially for precipitation
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2" class="xref">2</xref>. Some require information on change over the coming decades (for example, to inform adaptation policy), while for others the potential benefits of mitigation action later in the century is of more interest (that is, the difference in climate change between high- and low-emission scenarios). It is important to quantify and understand likely climate changes under these distinct conditions, but they are not always examined separately.
