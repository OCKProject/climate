<p class="p">The increased tropospheric stability under greenhouse warming also occurs in the equatorial Pacific. In the Pacific, however, this is offset by an increased probability of atmospheric deep convection over the equatorial eastern Pacific, where the fastest warming in the tropics occurs (fig. S8), leading to an increased rainfall response of SST anomalies under greenhouse warming (
