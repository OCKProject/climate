 </xref>), manifested in a rising motion commencing approximately 600 hPa in both the present day and future climates (
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>). In response to diabatic heating anomalies, the response of vertical velocity is smaller in the future than in the present-day climate in the majority of models (
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 3C</xref>), with 14 of 17 models generating a weaker response in the future climate. Aggregated over all models, there is a statistically significant weakening in the multimodel response of the vertical velocity to the Atl-EOF index, by as much as 47%, as can be seen from comparison of slopes for the present-day and future climates (
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 3D</xref>). The weakened convection response is accompanied by a decreased precipitation response to Atlantic Niño/Niña under future climate, with a strong (14 of 17) intermodel consensus (fig. S7).
