 </xref>), reducing the boreal summer mean negative vertical temperature gradient, defined as the difference between the boreal summer mean temperature at 600 hPa and the temperature at 925 hPa. This weakened negative vertical gradient is seen in all selected models (
 <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 4B</xref>). It is this more stable troposphere that weakens the convective response, leading to the weakened Atlantic Niño–Pacific connection; models that generate a larger reduction in the background temperature gradient tend to simulate a weaker boreal winter Pacific SST response (
 <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 4B</xref>), and the tendency is statistically significant. The weakened connection occurs despite a strengthening ocean-atmosphere coupling in the equatorial Pacific under greenhouse warming (
 <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">

 </xref>), which would otherwise enhance the connection.
