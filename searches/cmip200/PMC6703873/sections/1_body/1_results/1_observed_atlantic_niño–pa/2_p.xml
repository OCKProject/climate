<p class="p">Given that the impact on the tropical Pacific reaches a maximum two seasons later (i.e., December, January, and February or D0JF1, where “1” refers to the following year), we measure the evolution of Atlantic Niño–Pacific connection by a correlation between the Atl-EOF index (i.e., PC1 at JJA0) and D0JF1 SST anomalies averaged over the equatorial Pacific (5°S to 5°N and 160°E to 90°W), in sliding 20-year windows with the result recorded in the last year of the window (black curve in 
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 1A</xref>). Substantial fluctuations in the connection are seen, culminating in a persistent strong connection since the late 1960s. Considering that the relationship might not be statistically significant over the entire area of the equatorial Pacific, for each 20-year period, we calculated correlations with grid-point D0JF1 SST anomalies, but only significant grid-point correlations are averaged (red points in
