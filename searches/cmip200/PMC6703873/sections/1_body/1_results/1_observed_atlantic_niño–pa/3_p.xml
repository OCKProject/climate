<p class="p">The persistent connection reflects an important relationship between ENSO events (defined by National Ocean Atmosphere Administration) and the Atlantic Niño events (defined by a 0.5 SD threshold of Atl-EOF index) (table S1). A total of 10 of 17 Atlantic Niño events are followed by La Niña events, including the more extreme events of 1988 and 1998. Eight of 17 Atlantic Niña events were followed by El Niño events, including the 1982, 1997, and 2015 extreme El Niño events. Because of the recent persistent correlation, a statistically significant Atlantic Niño–Pacific connection over the 1900–1999 period is seen in much of the equatorial Pacific (black bar in

Below, we examine the Atlantic Niño–Pacific connection under historical forcing and the representative concentration pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) emission scenario in climate models participating in phase 5 of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) (see “Observed and CMIP5 data” section in Materials and Methods).
