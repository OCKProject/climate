<p class="p">To depict the observed Atlantic Niño and its impact on the Pacific Ocean, we applied empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis to quadratically detrended SST anomalies (see “EOF analysis” section in Materials and Methods) averaged over boreal summer (June, July, and August or JJA0, where “0” refers to current year), in which an Atlantic Niño peaks. This yields a dominant principal pattern, and a principal component (PC) time series scaled to have a standard deviation (SD) of 1. In place of an index commonly taken as an average over a fixed area (

 </xref>), we take the PC time series as the Atlantic Niño/Niña index, hereafter referred to as Atl-EOF index. Together with its associated pattern, the Atl-EOF index describes the anomaly pattern and evolution of the Atlantic Niño/Niña.
