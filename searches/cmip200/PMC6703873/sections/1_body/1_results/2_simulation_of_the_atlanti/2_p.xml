<p class="p">The Atlantic Niño pattern simulated by the 17 selected models is comparable to that in the observation, although they are generally weaker and more equatorially confined than the observed pattern (fig. S2). Our approach is to examine how the Atlantic Niño–Pacific connection, as simulated by a model, may change under greenhouse warming. An intermodel relationship shows that correlation over the full 100-year period increases with the maximum of 20-year sliding correlations over the same 100 years (fig. S3). Thus, as in the observed data, the correlation coefficient over the 100-year period is contributed by period(s) of large statistically significant correlation embedded in multidecadal fluctuations. The 17 models in aggregation produce the observed forcing of Atlantic Niño on the Pacific, i.e., an Atlantic Niño leads to a Pacific La Niña and an Atlantic Niña leads to a Pacific El Niño (compare figs. S1 and S4), through the Pacific Bjerknes feedback involving winds, SST, and the thermocline.</p>
