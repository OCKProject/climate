<p class="p">We identify CMIP5 models that are able to simulate the Atlantic Niño–Pacific connection. As for the observations, we applied EOF analysis to JJA0 SST anomalies quadratically detrended over the full 200 years (1900–2099). This allows our models to have an Atlantic Niño pattern that is different from the observed and different from one model to another. As in our analysis of the observed data, we correlate the Atl-EOF index (JJA0 PC time series) with grid-point D0JF1 equatorial Pacific SST anomalies over the 1900–1999 period, referred to as the present-day climate (see “Model selection” section in Materials and Methods). We use an average correlation over grid points with a significant coefficient to evaluate whether a model is able to simulate the Atlantic Niño–Pacific connection (see “Sign-dependent average” section in Materials and Methods). These approaches are adapted to select as many models as possible. A total of 17 models simulate a connection reminiscent of the observed, although the locations of correlation could be different (
