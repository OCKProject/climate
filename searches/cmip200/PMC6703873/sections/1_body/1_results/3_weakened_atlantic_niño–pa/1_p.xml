<p class="p">We compare the Atlantic Niño–Pacific connection in the 17 selected models between the present period and the future period (2000–2099). There is no consistent change in variability of Atlantic Niño (fig. S5). For each period, we regress grid-point SST anomalies onto the Atl-EOF index, yielding the response of the equatorial Pacific grid-point SST (D0JF1), per SD of the Atl-EOF time series. We obtain an average of regression coefficients over the grid points with statistically significant correlation coefficients above the 95% confidence level (see “Sign-dependent average” section in Materials and Methods). A total of 13 of 17 selected models, or 76%, generate a reduced response (
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 2A</xref>). Aggregated over the 17 models, there is a reduction of 47.8%, from −0.178°C SD
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> in the present-day climate to −0.093°C SD
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> in the future climate. This reduction is statistically significant above the 99% confidence level, according to the bootstrap method (see “Bootstrap test” section in Materials and Methods) (fig. S6A), supported by a comparison in the evolution of the Atlantic Niño–Pacific connection for the two periods (fig. S4), showing a conspicuous weakening in the connection.
