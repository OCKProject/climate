<p class="p">We further confirm the above result by two sets of 20-member experiments using a coupled model of intermediate complexity (see “Model description” section in Materials and Methods), under a control [355 parts per million (ppm), constant] and 4× CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (1420 ppm) concentration (see “Model experiments” section in Materials and Methods). The 4× CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> leads to a weakening in the mean vertical temperature gradient of 0.72 K per °C of global warming. In each fully coupled model setting, the observed Atlantic Niño pattern (fig. S1A) is amplified by a factor of 4 to increase a response signal, imposed as an initial condition on the first day of June with an added stochastic noise. We analyze the response to the initial condition in the ensuing year. Aggregated over the 20 experiments, under the control condition, the Atlantic Niño–Pacific connection is produced, but under the 4× CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> condition, the connection weakens markedly, commencing from a much reduced vertical velocity at 600 hPa (
