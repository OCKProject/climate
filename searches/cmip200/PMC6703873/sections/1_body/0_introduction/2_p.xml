<p class="p">An El Niño induced by an Atlantic Niña tends to have an anomaly center in the eastern Pacific (

 </xref>), a type of event that is strong in strength and impact. The 1982 and 1997 extreme El Niño, the strongest events of the 20th century, were both preceded by an Atlantic Niña (table S1). The strongest La Niña events over the 20th century, 1988 and 1998, which caused billions in damage and loss of tens of thousands of lives (
