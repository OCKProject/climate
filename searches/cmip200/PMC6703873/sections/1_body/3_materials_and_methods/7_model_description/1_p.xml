 </xref>), which is a fully coupled system consisting of the Community Atmosphere Model version 3.1 (CAM3.1) and a 1.5-layer reduced-gravity ocean (RGO) model with flux corrections (CAM3.1-RGO model hereafter). The atmospheric component is part of the Community Climate System Model version 3 developed at the NCAR. It was based on a Eulerian spectral dynamical core, with a T42 horizontal resolution and 26 vertical levels. The land surface processes in CAM3.1 were represented by the Community Land Model version 3, a fully interactive land model. The oceanic component was an extended Zebiak-Cane type of 1.5-layer RGO model (

 </xref>). The active upper ocean layer was divided into a fixed-depth mixed layer to simulate SST variation and a subsurface layer to parameterize the entrained subsurface temperature through the multivariate linear relationship with thermocline depth. The ocean model covers a global domain (80°S to 80°N and 0°E to 360°E) with 1° latitude by 2° longitude resolution, which contains variability off the equatorial band [see more details in (
