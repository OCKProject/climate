<p class="p">The correlation or regression coefficients in the equatorial Pacific region (5°S to 5°N and 160°E to 90°W) were averaged as follows. First, only correlation (or regression) coefficients at grid points that are statistically significant (more than 95% confidence level) were considered. Coefficients that are not significant were discarded. We then examined whether the retained values in terms of a whole-region average. If negative, then only the significant negative coefficients were averaged, or if positive, then only the significant positive coefficients were averaged. If there were no significant coefficients at any grid points in the equatorial Pacific region (5°S to 5°N and 160°E to 90°W), the result was set to be zero (see
