<p class="p">To depict the Atlantic Niño unique to each model, we applied an EOF analysis to quadratically detrended JJA0 SST anomalies of tropical Atlantic (20°S to 20°N and 60°W to 20°E) to capture the observed and modeled Atlantic Niño (

 </xref>). We did not use the commonly used ATL3 index defined as the SST anomaly in the central-eastern equatorial Atlantic (3°S to 3°N and 20°W to 0°E). Although this index captures the observed Atlantic Niño, it might be inappropriate for CMIP5 outputs because the pattern of Atlantic Niño varies substantially among models. For CMIP5 models, the EOF analysis was applied to the full 200-year period (1900–2099) to represent the overall simulations of Atlantic Niño in both the present-day and future climates. Anomalies here were computed by removing seasonal cycles referenced to the long-term mean and quadratic trends from the monthly data (for all the CMIP5 outputs, the anomalies were obtained on the basis of the full 200-year period). Following (
