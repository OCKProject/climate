<p id="Par41" class="p">We also considered subtracting the impact of solar forcing, but have disregarded this for three reasons. First, direct measurements start only in 1978. If we limit ourselves to this period the length of the time series is shortened and thereby limits the robustness of any computed prediction skill. Second, for longer time series solar forcing is based on a reconstruction, which appears to be unstable leading to large unrealistic trends degrading the prediction skill. Third, solar irradiance is weak compared to other forcing and internal variability

 </sup>. Hence, including it in the internal variability hardly affects the results.
