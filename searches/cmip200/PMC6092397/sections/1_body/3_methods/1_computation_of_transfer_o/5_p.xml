<p id="Par35" class="p">The transfer operators are built by evaluating the number of trajectories from the entire multimodel database in each state (individual grid box) and then evaluating the number of these trajectories ending-up in each possible state after a given transition time (
 <italic class="italic">τ</italic>). The ratio of these two numbers gives the probability from a trajectory in an initial state to end-up in a final state after a time 
 <italic class="italic">τ</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). The probability of state transition is repeated for 
 <italic class="italic">τ</italic> = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 years, leading to 10 transfer operators for each of the 10 averaging times 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic> (so a total of 100 transfer operators).
