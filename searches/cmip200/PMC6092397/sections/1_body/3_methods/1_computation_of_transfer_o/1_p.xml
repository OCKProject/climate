 </sup> followed a multimodel approach using 10 climate models. The GMT and SST data are estimated based on historical simulations followed by the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 simulations. These simulations were gathered from the CMIP5 database

 </sup>. The 10 models are (with the number of ensemble members used in square brackets): “CCSM4” [6]; “CNRM-CM5” [5]; “CSIRO-Mk3-6-0” [10]; “CanESM2” [5]; “HadGEM2-ES” [3]; “IPSL-CM5A-LR” [4]; “FIO-ESM” [3]; “MPI-ESM-LR” [3]; “MIROC5” [3]; and “EC-EARTH” [16]. These models have been selected from the CMIP5 database because they have at least three members and the required data fields. For each model, to obtain the trajectory anomalies, the multi-member mean is removed from individual trajectories. Finally, for the purposes of this study GMT and SST are time averaged using a simple running average set to
