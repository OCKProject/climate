<p id="Par32" class="p">To determine the transfer operators we split the one-dimensional phase space defined by GMT or SST with a uniform resolution of 
 <italic class="italic">η</italic>. Individual grid box lengths are 6
 <italic class="italic">σ</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">η</italic> where 
 <italic class="italic">σ</italic> is the standard deviation of GMT or SST. (The most extremes boxes reached infinity to cover the entire phase space, including extreme cases.) We set 
 <italic class="italic">η</italic> = 24 for numerical applications. This number allows a good balance between high resolution (number of boxes) and reliable statistics (number of transition in each boxes). With these numbers the Transfer Operator is able to represent 24 different states with 500 individual transitions on average to build an accurate statistical transition between states.
