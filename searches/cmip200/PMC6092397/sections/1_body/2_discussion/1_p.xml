 </sup>. In this study we used CMIP5 simulations to train a statistical model to predict variations of GMT and SST with respect to the forced trend on interannual to decadal timescales. The statistical model is based on the Transfer Operator framework that transforms deterministic trajectories into probabilistic ones. Hence, our derived prediction system is naturally fitted for probabilistic forecasts, and is named PROCAST.
