  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>
 </sup>. These studies relate variations in observations with variations in external forcing to explain, or partially explain, the observed changes. For example, changes in global-mean surface air temperature (GMT) can be partially attributed to variations in external climatic forcing, such as volcanic eruptions or aerosol and greenhouse gas emissions

 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). However, there still remains a residual to this forced component (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>e), which can be interpreted as the internal variability of the climate. This variability, because of its dominance over the forced trend on interannual to decadal timescales (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>g), is at the heart of interannual climate prediction

 </sup>, and the goal of our study. Moreover, since volcanic eruptions are unpredictable by essence and aerosol and greenhouse gas emissions depend on socio-economic choices, further improvement of climate predictions will mainly occur through better, more accurate predictions of the internal variability. This conclusion is also true for the global-mean sea surface temperature (SST) studied here (Fig.
