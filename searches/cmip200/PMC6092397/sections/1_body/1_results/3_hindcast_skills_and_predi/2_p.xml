<p id="Par15" class="p">As before, the probabilistic distribution is computed for up to 10-year lags and for annual to 10-year averaged data. Similar to the perfect model approach, skill values decrease from 1 to 0 depending on the lags (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). Focusing on a 5-year mean prediction of SST, we still have a skill for 5-year lags of ~30% (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5d</xref>), suggesting our ability to accurately forecast part of the SST variations for the next 5 years. More generally the skills are always better than persistence (except for a few averaging times and hindcast lags of SST). Also reliability remains close to 1, even when the skill is low, suggesting that even for low skills we are sampling an accurate range of possible future states. The same holds for predictions of GMT, but with slightly reduced skill compared to SST. This demonstrates the usefulness of PROCAST for probabilistic predictions.
