 </sup>. We define this recent hiatus as the post-1998 decade cooling seen in GMT anomaly (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1e</xref>). This cooling totally offsets the forced warming (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1c</xref>) leading to a plateau in the observed, total warming (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref>). PROCAST is indeed able to reproduce the decade-long cooling anomaly (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>) for all averaging timescales tested (1–10 years). The coefficient of determination is 0.52 on average (for averaging timescales ranging from 1 to 5 years and could be as high as 0.6 or 0.64 for 1 and 5-year time averages, respectively. This suggests that 60% and 64% of the annual and 5-year variations, respectively, are accurately predicted for a decade long. For these two examples the correlation coefficient is also high with values of 0.63 and 0.64. Despite some error in its exact intensity (especially when focusing on mean prediction) or the details of its annual variations, this shows that an event such as the post-1998 hiatus could not have been missed using PROCAST (especially when acknowledging the predictive spread). In particular our probabilistic forecast framework shows that a decade-long hiatus was always a likely outcome (always well within 1 standard deviation of our prediction), even if not the most likely, especially after 7 years. Because the amplitude is somewhat lower than observed, it would be consistent if a small part of the hiatus was indeed caused by external forcing, although the main part would be due to internal variability

 </sup>. Other starting dates have been tested (such as 2002) and always allow PROCAST to capture the long-term hiatus, but to a lesser degree the exact interannual variation of the decades.
