<p id="Par24" class="p">For the forecasted 5-year averaged temperatures (i.e., for the period 2018–2022), the predictions differ. For GMT, the predictions suggest a balanced probability between warm and cold events (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7f</xref>) on top of the forced trend, with a small relative reduction of expected occurrence of extreme cold and a small relative increase of expected occurance of extreme warm events (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7i</xref>). For SST, the forecast still suggests an anomalous warm event for the period 2018–2022 with an expected value of 0.05 K (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8f</xref>). The forecast also suggests a relative increase of the probability of extreme warm events for SST over this period, by up to 400% (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8i</xref>).
