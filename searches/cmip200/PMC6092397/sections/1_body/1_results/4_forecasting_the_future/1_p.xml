<p id="Par21" class="p">After the skill of the method has been assessed, we compute a probabilistic forecast of GMT and SST from 2018 to 2027 (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref>), focusing on three averaging times: 1-, 2-, and 5-year averages. We also considered longer averaging times, such as a 10-year averaging period, but these all show forecast probabilities almost equivalent to the climatological probability (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Similarly, for long enough lags or forecast times (i.e., a decade) the predictions always converge to the climatological values (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8a–c</xref>).
