  <p class="p">Predictions of the post-1998 hiatus observed through GMT anomalies. Observation and prediction of GMT anomalies averaged over 
   <bold class="bold">a</bold> 1 year, 
   <bold class="bold">b</bold> 2 years, and 
   <bold class="bold">c</bold> 5 years. Hiatus is defined as the post-1998 decade (blue line) showing a decrease of GMT anomalies partially or totally offsetting the forced trend. Decadal prediction means and standard deviations (red circles and vertical lines, respectively) are obtained using PROCAST initialized in 1998 (red squares). Prediction skills are computed through the coefficient of determination (
   <italic class="italic">R</italic>
   <sup class="sup">2</sup>) and the correlation coefficient (CC) over the post-1998 decade. 
   <bold class="bold">d</bold>–
   <bold class="bold">f</bold> are equivalent to 
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>–
   <bold class="bold">c</bold> with the addition of the observed component attributed to forcing (purple lines)
