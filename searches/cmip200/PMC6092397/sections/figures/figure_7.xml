  <p class="p">Interannual probabilistic forecast of the GMT anomalies. 
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>–
   <bold class="bold">c</bold> Mean prediction of GMT anomaly for the next 5 years for three different averaging times: annual, 2, and 5 years; horizontal black lines correspond to the mean and ±1 standard deviations of the climatological distribution. Circles and squares represent mean predictions with coefficient of determination bigger and smaller than 0.2 (note that we still have good reliability even for skills smaller than 0.2); colorscale represents the mean prediction of the GMT anomaly; the vertical colored lines represent ±1 standard deviation of prediction distributions. Stars denote the most likely state from the distributions. 
   <bold class="bold">d</bold>–
   <bold class="bold">f</bold> Prediction of GMT distribution (in %) for 1, 2, and 5 years in advance with respect to 2017. Gray histograms in the background represent the asymptotic, climatological distribution; vertical blue lines represent the current position used to initialize the forecast system; vertical black lines correspond to the mean, ±1, and ±2 standard deviations of the climatological distribution. 
   <bold class="bold">g</bold>–
   <bold class="bold">i</bold> Distribution of probability anomaly (in %), probability changes with respect to the climatological distribution, for the 1, 2, and 5 years in advance predictions. Background colorscale represents ±0–1, 1–2, and more than 2 standard deviations, respectively, consistently with moderate, intense, and extreme events
