   <sup class="sup">2</sup>—between observations and mean prediction for different hindcast lags and averaging times. The coefficient of determination between model observations and persistence (i.e., the null hypothesis of prediction) is also computed to give a benchmark. Thick contour lines represent values of 0.5, thin dashed—lower skill, and thin solid—higher skill, with contour intervals of 0.1; and hatching shows skill lower than the persistence.

   <bold class="bold">f</bold> Reliability of the prediction for different hindcast lags and averaging times. Thick red, black, and white contour lines represent values of 0.8, 1, and 1.2, respectively; thin black dashed and solid lines represent lower and higher values than 1, respectively, with contour intervals of 0.1. Note the better skill than persistence (almost no hatched region) and the good reliability close to 1 for all hindcast lags and averaging times
