  <p class="p">Interannual hindcast skills of GMT and SST within a perfect model approach. 
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>, 
   <bold class="bold">b</bold> Skill of the prediction measured by the coefficient of determination—
   <italic class="italic">R</italic>
   <sup class="sup">2</sup>—between model observations and mean prediction for different hindcast lags and averaging times. The coefficient of determination between model observations and persistence (i.e., the null hypothesis of prediction) is also computed to give a benchmark. Thick contour lines represent values of 0.5, thin dashed—lower skill, and thin solid—higher skill, with contour intervals of 0.1; and hatching shows skill lower than the persistence. 
   <bold class="bold">c</bold>, 
   <bold class="bold">d</bold> Reliability of the prediction for different hindcast lags and averaging times. Note the absence of hatched region in 
   <bold class="bold">a</bold> and 
   <bold class="bold">b</bold> denoting the better skill than persistence for all hindcast lags and averaging times. Also, note the flat pink color in 
   <bold class="bold">c</bold> and 
   <bold class="bold">d</bold> corresponding to a good reliability close to 1 for all hindcast lags and averaging times, as expected in a perfect model approach. 
   <bold class="bold">e</bold>, 
   <bold class="bold">f</bold> Difference between the coefficient of determination for the hindcasts with observations and within a perfect model approach (

   <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5c, d</xref> for GMT and SST). For all hindcast lags and averaging times, the skill is better for observations than for the perfect model approach. Thick black lines are for zero values, thin black lines are positive values with a contour interval of 0.05
