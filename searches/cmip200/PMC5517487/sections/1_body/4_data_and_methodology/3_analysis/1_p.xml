 </sup>, we conduct our analysis for the HUC4 (i.e., 4-digit Hydrologic Unit Code) sub-basins (

Here, the aggregated soil moisture for the three soil layers as represented in the VIC model are used. Meteorological, agricultural and hydrological droughts are derived based on the monthly time series of HUC4 sub-basin mean precipitation, soil moisture and runoff, respectively. Historical droughts based on CMIP5-VIC are validated against those by observation based OBS-VIC for the reference period 1971–2000. Future changes are calculated in a 30-year time window along 1971–2099 relative to the reference period 1971–2000 for each CMIP5-VIC combination under each RCP scenario. We acknowledge that the magnitude of changes may differ if a different present-day period is selected for analysis. The multi-model ensemble mean is used for illustration and the standard deviation among simulations is used to denote the uncertainty range from climate models

 </sup>. Here, we conduct such assessments of 1.5 °C global warming on US droughts to provide the scientific basis for political discussions about mitigation and adaptation strategies. Specifically, global mean temperature is first calculated for each 30-year time window. We select the first 30-year period when the +1.5C global temperature is crossed for each climate model under each RCP. We then calculate the drought changes in the selected period corresponding to a 1.5C warming world for each model under each RCP. Investigation of drought changes with global warming can better inform policy-makers on regional mitigation and adaptation strategies, as governments and organizations are more concerned on the impacts associated with the target value of global mean temperature rise

 </sup>. In addition to climatological mean of droughts, we examine the changes in extreme droughts in terms of longest duration and largest intensity. What’s more, changes in droughts with four duration categories are calculated, i.e., D1, D2, D3 and D4 with duration of 1~3, 4~6, 7~12, &gt;12 months, respectively. Specifically, we first calculate the changes in D1, D2, D3 and D4 droughts for each region. We then compare the changes among the four drought categories and select the one which shows the largest change than other three categories as the dominant one. The fraction of lands dominated by each drought category is then counted for each period to show the temporal evolutions.
