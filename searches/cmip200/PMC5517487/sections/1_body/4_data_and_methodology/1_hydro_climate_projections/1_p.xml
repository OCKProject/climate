 </sup> are used (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>) to capture the possible uncertainty range arising from climate models and emissions pathways. Compared to the CMIP3, the CMIP5 models have notable changes in model physics, resolution and greenhouse gas emission and land cover change scenarios. The CMIP5 climate model projections are statistically downscaled to 1/8 degree resolution and bias-corrected against the observed climate

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" class="xref">65</xref>
 </sup>. Specifically, daily precipitation is first aggregated into monthly scale for both CMIP5 simulations and observations, based on which monthly scaling factors are calculated between the two during the overlap period

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">39</xref>
 </sup>. Then, a historical daily precipitation pattern is resampled for a specific month and adjusted by the monthly scaling factor to match simulated monthly precipitation totals with observations, while preserving the observed wet-day fractions. By this, the bias-corrected daily precipitation has the same monthly climatology and wet-day fractions with observations, but has its own wet-dry day sequence as produced by CMIP5 climate models.
