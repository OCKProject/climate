 </sup>, respectively. That is, meteorological drought is based on precipitation, while agricultural and hydrological drought is based on soil moisture and runoff, respectively. Here, the SPI is computed by fitting a gamma distribution to precipitation for specified months during the reference period 1971–2000. The gamma distribution is adopted since the distribution of monthly precipitation is typically similar to a gamma distribution. The SPI is designed with respect to normal conditions at a given site for a given period

Concurrent drought is defined as the period when meteorological, agricultural and hydrological droughts are all experienced. In this study, we use the following three metrics for measuring droughts: (1) frequency: the number of drought events in a specific period; (2) duration: the length of a drought event; and (3) intensity: the average of index value lower than the drought threshold.
