 </sup>. However, very few studies have reported scenarios consistent with the 1.5 °C target, especially on the droughts. Here, we link regional droughts to global temperature rise and, specifically, assess the response of droughts to the 1.5 °C target to provide scientific basis on mitigation and adaptation measures. We focus our investigation in the conterminous United States (CONUS) where droughts have resulted in average annual damage up to $6–8 billions

 </sup>. In this study, we try to investigate the drought of various types rather than examining the discrepancy arising from the formulation of a specific drought index. Specifically, we use a large ensemble of 97 1/8 degree hydro-climate model simulations to investigate future changes in the meteorological, agricultural, and hydrological droughts. By this, we attempt to explore the possible uncertainty in the projected droughts from the perspective of drought type, climate model and emission scenario, which is critical to inform policy-makings for adaptions. Specifically, we examine the following scientific questions: 1) How will drought change in terms of frequency, duration and intensity in response to different levels of global warming? 2) Are there robust patterns in the changes in meteorological, agricultural, hydrological drought and its concurrence? 3) Will the impacts of global warming on drought of various types and their probabilistic distributions be asymmetric? In other words, will drought change pattern be similar between the mean and extreme of the investigated drought types?
