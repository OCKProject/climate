<p id="Par14" class="p">Potential changes in drought would have adverse impacts on water management, ecosystem and social-economy. However, measuring drought itself is non-trivial as various drought indices have been used for different types of drought. A single drought event can be measured by its duration and intensity, while certain number of droughts in a period can be characterized by the probabilistic distribution (e.g., mean and extreme drought). Uncertainties arising from climate models, emission scenarios and impact models also add up to the uncertainties

 </sup>, often making it hard to inform policy-makings for adaptions. This study provides a comprehensive investigation on regional droughts over CONUS in response to global warming. Specifically, we investigate the changes in meteorological, agricultural and hydrological droughts and the concurrence based on 97 high-resolution hydro-climatic model projections. We also conduct specific assessment of droughts in the 1.5 °C warming world as advocated in the recent Paris agreement to provide scientific basis for mitigation and adaptation strategies.
