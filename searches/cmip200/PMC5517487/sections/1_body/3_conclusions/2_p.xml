<p id="Par15" class="p">Our results show that historical drought patterns can be well reproduced by the model ensemble, although bias of various magnitudes exist in reproducing specific features of drought. With global warming, meteorological drought frequency will decrease in the future, while agricultural and hydrological droughts are projected to increase. Durations of meteorological, hydrological and agricultural droughts remain relatively stable when averaged over the country. On the contrary, the intensity of all drought types are projected to increase linearly under RCP8.5 scenario, indicating that future drought intensities over CONUS can be derived directly from a given level of global mean temperature rise in this scenario. The spatial structure of short, medium and long-term droughts will remain stable after 2020s while extreme droughts in terms of longest duration and intensity are projected to increase much faster than the climatological mean. Regionally, droughts are highlighted as one of the great challenges for several hot spot regions that are consistently projected to be more strongly affected by drought under the 1.5 °C warming world. Several of the regions are important agricultural areas (e.g., California and Midwest Corn Belt), on which global food production would critically depend in the future.</p>
