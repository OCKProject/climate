<p id="Par16" class="p">The projected increase in droughts with global warming represents a threat to humans and ecosystems in CONUS. The distinct response of droughts of various types to global warming indicates the importance of considering more than one type of drought in climate change impact assessments. This study emphasizes the asymmetric impact of global warming on the probabilistic distribution of droughts resulting in a much stronger influence on extreme droughts than mean droughts. This finding has important implications for informing water management strategies and adaption measures coping with high-impact drought extremes.</p>
