<p id="Par11" class="p">We also examine the changes in extreme droughts in terms of longest duration and largest intensity. Indeed, changes in the longest drought can exert more profound impacts than the mean droughts. When averaged over the country, changes in the longest drought remain generally stable towards the end of 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century, consistent with the climatology mean but with larger uncertainty ranges (Supplementary Figures 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>). However, it is evident that agricultural drought with the longest duration is projected to increase substantially from 15 months to 17 months at the end of 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century. The longer drought durations could be attributed to the greater increases in extreme precipitation than in the mean in a warming climate, which could lead to a reduction in the number of wet days and an increase in dry spell length (i.e., longer drought durations)

 </sup> identifying the southwest US as one of the hot spot regions with aggravated droughts in the future. The asymmetric change in drought distribution indicates that projected increases in droughts are mainly driven by changes in extreme droughts. Our results highlight the importance of examining drought distributions and its extremes given the uneven changing ratios as revealed in this study and the distinct implications of their impacts on water resource management and ecosystems.
