<p id="Par10" class="p">A single drought event can be characterized by its duration and intensity, while certain number of droughts in a period can be measured by the climatological mean and distribution. Previous climate change impact studies mainly focused on the mean of droughts, leaving the changes in drought distribution under-investigated. Will impact of global warming on drought distribution be asymmetric? That is, will changes be similar between the mean and extreme droughts? Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref> shows the land fraction dominated by droughts in different duration bins. Here, we first calculate drought changes for each duration bin. We then compare the changes among the four duration bins and select the one which shows the largest change than other three bins as the dominant one (see methods). Generally, the drought structure exhibits an unstable pattern during the earlier study period (e.g., 1980s). The large variation during the earlier periods could be attributed to the fact that climate change impact signal is small in earlier periods as the changes are calculated relative to the reference period 1971–2000. With global warming, the signal tends to emerge with time and the defined drought structure become stable towards the end of 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century. Specifically, changes in meteorological and concurrent droughts with duration ranging from 1–3 months dominate ~30% of US’s lands, while the land fraction dominated by droughts longer than 12 months is less than 5%.Droughts longer than 12 months dominate up to 30% and 20% of US lands for agricultural and hydrological droughts, respectively, although durations of 4–6 months still exert the largest impacts. Importantly, land fractions dominated by different duration bins of droughts remain generally stable after 2020s for all drought types. Such pattern is consistent across the four emission scenarios although the magnitude would differ to some degree.
