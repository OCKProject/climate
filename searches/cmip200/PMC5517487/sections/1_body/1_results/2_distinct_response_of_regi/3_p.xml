 </sup>, leading to increase in hydrological drought frequency. For example, agricultural and hydrological drought events show large percentage increase in Pacific Northwest and California where meteorological droughts are projected to decrease. Notably, the spatial patterns of changes in agricultural, hydrological and meteorological droughts are found to be weakly correlated. This indicates that agricultural and hydrological droughts cannot be directly determined from precipitation alone as models add information to the signal derived from precipitation

 </sup>. Concurrent droughts experience substantial increases, in particular, in the Texas, California, Pacific Northwest and Colorado with relatively small changes over Northern Great Plains and eastern US. Much larger areas will experience decreasing duration of droughts, which is consistent among drought types except for larger magnitude of changes in agricultural and hydrological drought durations. Drought intensities are projected to increase in most of the country independent of drought types. In extreme case, agricultural and meteorological drought intensities are projected to increase by more than 40% in Pacific Northwest. Droughts are projected to increase the most in several hot spot regions which have experienced recent droughts (e.g., Texas, Pacific Northwest and California), highlighting the regions that are consistently projected to be more strongly affected by droughts in the future than other regions.
