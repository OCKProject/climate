 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> shows the evolution of US mean frequency and duration of meteorological, agricultural, hydrological and concurrent droughts based on CMIP5-VIC simulations under four Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios (i.e., RCP8.5, RCP6.0, RCP4.5 and RCP2.6). Here, we show the changes with global mean temperature rather than the time, mainly because we attempt to link regional droughts with global temperature rise which are informative for mitigation and adaptation strategies. Changes in drought with time can be found in the Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>. The US mean frequency of meteorological drought is decreasing with global warming, independent of emission scenarios. In contrast, agricultural and hydrological droughts are projected to become more frequent. This is reasonable given the fact that meteorological drought is based on precipitation deficit while agricultural and hydrological droughts are defined on the basis of soil moisture and runoff, respectively. Increase of precipitation does not necessarily result in increase of soil moisture and runoff, as the latter two are governed by several land surface processes such as evapotranspiration, soil storage and snow accumulation/melt

 </sup>. The deficit of precipitation minus evaporation (i.e., the available water) would result in less water in soils and rivers. Therefore, more agricultural and hydrological droughts are projected even if we have less meteorological drought. In general, increases in drought statistics are greatest under the highest emission scenario RCP8.5, and least under the lowest emission scenario RCP2.6. The differing responses of droughts to the same level of global warming demonstrate the importance to investigate droughts of various types in a consistent manner, instead of focusing one drought type as in previous studies. This also emphasizes the need to explicitly examine the changes in specific drought features which are neglected in global and regional scale studies. Associated with droughts are pronounced durations while decreasing durations of meteorological droughts are projected under RCP2.6 scenario. The most pronounced droughts are projected under RCP8.5 scenario in which global warming signal is much stronger than others.
