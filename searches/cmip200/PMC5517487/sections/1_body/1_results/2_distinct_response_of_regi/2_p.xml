<p id="Par8" class="p">In contrary to differing drought responses in terms of frequency and duration to global warming scenarios, more consistent changes in drought intensity are found. As shown in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>, droughts of all types are projected to become more severe with global warming independent of emission scenarios, although the inter-model ranges denoted by the error bars are considerable. The increase in drought severity could be attributed to increase in the vapor pressure deficits driven by higher temperatures and subsequent increase of atmospheric evaporative demand

 </sup> and etc. Importantly, changes in drought intensity are found to scale linearly with global warming amount especially under RCP8.5 scenario at the 95% confidence level, implying that future drought intensities over CONUS can be derived directly from given level of global mean temperature rise. This has great implications for mitigation and adaptation strategies as drought projections often involve extensive computation cost in driving complex impact models with an ensemble of climate models. However, such relations are not evident under other emission scenarios. Changes in the concurrence of meteorological, agricultural, and hydrological droughts which could exert more severe effects than any other single drought type in terms of impacts generally follow the pattern of agricultural and hydrological droughts.
