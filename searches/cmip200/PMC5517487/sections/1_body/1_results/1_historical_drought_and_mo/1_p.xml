That is, meteorological drought is based on observed precipitation while hydrological and agricultural drought are based on the simulated runoff and soil moisture by the VIC model driven with observed climate

 </sup>, respectively. Distinct spatial patterns are found in the frequency, duration and intensity among the three drought types due to the role of land surface processes in regulating the response of agricultural and hydrological droughts to climate variability and change
