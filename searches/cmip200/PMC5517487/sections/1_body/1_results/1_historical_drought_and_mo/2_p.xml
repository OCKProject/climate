<p id="Par6" class="p">Future changes in droughts are based on bias-corrected CMIP5 climate and VIC simulations driven by bias-corrected CMIP5 climate (i.e., CMIP5-VIC, see methods for details). Before our investigation of future changes in droughts, we first examine the validity of CMIP5-VIC simulations in reproducing historical meteorological, agricultural and hydrological droughts by OBS-VIC over CONUS. Instead of examining the general drying trend as in previous climate model validations

 </sup>, we specifically investigate the validity in reproducing the frequency, duration and intensity of the three drought types. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> shows the Taylor diagram between CMIP5-VIC and OBS-VIC (i.e., the patterns in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>) in terms of frequency, duration and intensity of the three drought types. The spatial correlations between CMIP5-VIC and OBS-VIC range from 0.5 to 0.8 for most models, indicating the reasonable performance of the bias-corrected CMIP5-VIC simulations in capturing historical drought events. Model performance varies among the three drought types (i.e., meteorological, agricultural and hydrological droughts) and depends on the drought feature (i.e., frequency, duration and intensity) and metric (e.g., the spatial correlation, standard deviation and model range). As for the frequency, meteorological drought has lower model range compared to agricultural and hydrological droughts, indicating the better performance in simulating meteorological drought. However, the spatial correlation of simulated meteorological drought with observation is lower compared to agricultural and hydrological droughts, indicating the worse model performance in simulating meteorological drought. As for the duration and intensity, the model performance in simulating meteorological drought is higher than agricultural and hydrological droughts, as indicated by the lower model range and similar magnitude of spatial correlation. Larger model ranges are found in simulating drought duration followed by frequency and intensity, while wider ranges in simulating hydrological and agricultural droughts than meteorological drought are observed. The ability of bias-corrected CMIP-VIC simulations in reproducing historical drought patterns leads to higher confidence in projecting future droughts. Such validations have great implications for climate change impact assessment on droughts in which the adopted bias-correction technique is mainly used for reducing the bias in the climatology mean and/or quantile distributions
