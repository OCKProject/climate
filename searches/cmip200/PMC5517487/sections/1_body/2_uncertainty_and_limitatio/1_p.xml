<p id="Par12" class="p">In this paper, we aim to complement previous studies by analyzing the most up-to-date ensemble of 97 hydro-climatic simulations under four emission scenarios. In particular, we analyze the changes in meteorological, agricultural, hydrological drought and its concurrence. We also investigate the changing patterns of drought frequency, duration and intensity. Inclusion of other drought properties such as the total span (occurrence × duration) is not within the scope of this study. By this, we aim to provide a comprehensive estimation of the related uncertainties, depending on drought indices, climate models and emission scenarios. Besides model biases as indicated by the validations in the result section, there are additional limitations to our general conclusions as certain influencing factors are not considered in the model, e.g., the effects of land use and land cover change

 </sup> showed that irrigation water use can further exacerbate the low-flow conditions with climate warming. These local factors could interact and amplify/counteract the drought response to global warming. Hence, our results should mainly represent the first-order climate change impacts on droughts in CONUS.
