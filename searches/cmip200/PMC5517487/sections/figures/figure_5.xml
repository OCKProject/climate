  <p class="p">Multi-model ensemble mean changes (%) in the frequency, duration and intensity of meteorological, agricultural, hydrological and concurrent droughts in 1.5 °C global warming. The global mean temperature is first calculated for each 30-year time window. We select the first 30-year period when the +1.5C global warming is crossed for each climate model under each RCP. We then calculate the drought changes in the selected period corresponding to a 1.5C warming world for each model and the multi-model ensemble mean under each RCP is shown.
