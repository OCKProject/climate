  <p class="p">Taylor-diagram on the performance of CMIP5-VIC simulations in reproducing the frequency, duration and intensity of meteorological, agricultural and hydrological droughts by OBS-VIC during 1971–2000. The CMIP5-VIC refers to the bias-corrected CMIP5 climate and VIC simulations driven by bias-corrected CMIP5 climate. Black circles denote the simulations driven by CMIP5-VIC combinations with the numbers indicating the simulations driven by the climate model identified by the ID numbers in Table
