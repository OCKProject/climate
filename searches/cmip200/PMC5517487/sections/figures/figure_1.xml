  <p class="p">Spatial distribution of frequency (occurrences/30yrs), duration (months) and intensity (unitless) of meteorological, agricultural and hydrological droughts during 1971â€“2000. Meteorological drought is based on observed precipitation while hydrological and agricultural droughts are based on VIC simulated runoff and soil moisture driven by the observed climate, respectively. The frequency is referred to the number of drought occurrences for the given period while duration and intensity are for the climatology mean of those drought events.
