<p id="Par13" class="p">The availability of both direct and diffuse measurements is indispensable for the detection of cloud-free conditions, as clouds substantially modify the ratio between these two components. The Long and Ackerman (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">2000</xref>) clear-sky detection algorithm for shortwave radiation that we apply in this study makes use of this behaviour, as well as of the high temporal resolution of the data. Specifically, this algorithm analyses the magnitude and variability of the minute time-series of total (global) and diffuse shortwave irradiance periods to infer clear (i.e. cloudless) sky episodes. The identified clear-sky data at minute resolution are then used on a daily basis to empirically fit functions using the cosine of the solar zenith angle as the independent variable for days that exhibit the minimum amount of clear-sky times across the necessary range of solar zenith angles as defined by Long and Ackerman (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">2000</xref>). The fit coefficients are interpolated through time for days that cannot be adequately fitted, and then the coefficients (fitted or interpolated) are used to calculate continuous estimates of the clear-sky downward total, diffuse and direct shortwave radiation. The methodology requires some modification for climates such as the tropical western Pacific characterized by persistent cloudiness as detailed in Long and Gaustad (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">2004</xref>). As shown in Long and Ackerman (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">2000</xref>), the uncertainty of the clear-sky estimates due to interpolation is about of the same magnitude as the total shortwave measurements themselves for the instantaneous values. The long-term averaging of these values as used in the present study significantly decreases the uncertainties. Following the procedure as described above, clear-sky climatologies of surface downward shortwave radiation were produced at 53 BSRN sites which provide multiyear shortwave records that allow to establish climatologies (TableÂ

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">2017</xref>). The periods covered by these reference climatologies do not necessarily exactly match the ones of the model climatologies (which is not a strict requirement due to the non-deterministic nature of the modelling setups), yet both observational and model climatologies can be considered as representative of the beginning of the 21th century.
