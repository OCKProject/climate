<p id="Par14" class="p">The clear-sky detection algorithm for the longwave radiation is based on Long and Turner (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">2008</xref>), and takes into account the temporal variability of downward longwave radiation, as well as the difference between the measured ambient air temperature and effective sky brightness temperature calculated from the longwave measurements. The detected “effective” clear-sky data are used along with the previously detected shortwave clear-sky data to fit functions using collocated air temperature and humidity measurements as the independent variable in the formulation developed by Brutsaert (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">1975</xref>). These longwave detected periods are labelled “effective” clear-sky because the broadband downwelling longwave is insensitive to high, cold, thin clouds, thus the detected clear-sky times represent primarily periods with no low- and mid-level clouds. Similar to the shortwave clear-sky method, the fit coefficients are interpolated through time and used to produce continuous estimations of clear-sky longwave fluxes. Following this procedure, the data availability allowed the construction of clear-sky climatologies of surface downward longwave radiation at 31 BSRN sites (Table
