<p id="Par12" class="p">The observational reference data for the clear-sky fluxes at the Earthâ€™s surface are derived from the records of the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN, Ohmura et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">1998</xref>; Driemel et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">2018</xref>). BSRN is a worldwide network of radiation sites measuring at highest possible accuracy with well-calibrated instruments and known accuracy, which can serve as anchor sites for a variety of applications. BSRN became operational in the early 1990s with a few sites and has gradually been growing to contain now more than 60 sites in different climate zones, which report their data to the BSRN Archive at the Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI) (

The BSRN data are recorded and stored at high temporal resolution (minute data), which is a prerequisite for the application of clear-sky detection algorithms as outlined below. BSRN sites are further requested to record shortwave radiation not only in terms of its total flux (measured with a pyranometer), but also separately in terms of the direct shortwave flux (measured with a pyrheliometer) and the diffuse shortwave flux (measured with a shaded pyranometer).
