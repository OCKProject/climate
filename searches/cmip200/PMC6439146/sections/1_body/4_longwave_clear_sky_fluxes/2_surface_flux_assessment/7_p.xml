<p id="Par46" class="p">Overall climatological mean biases in downward surface longwave clear-sky radiation of the 37 individual CMIP5 models obtained by averaging the biases over all sites are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig" class="xref">12</xref>. A large spread in the overall biases can be seen amongst the models, ranging from + 10 to − 12 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>. As with the shortwave biases presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>, this large spread is not surprising, considering the substantial differences amongst the global mean downward surface longwave clear-sky radiation of the various models shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9</xref> (upper panel). The majority of the models (23 out of 37) overall overestimates the BSRN reference climatologies, whereas also strong underestimations in some of the models are evident. However, there are also numerous models that show hardly any overall biases in downward surface longwave clear-sky radiation, with 11 models having an overall bias of one Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> or less. The mean and median biases of all models only amount to 1.1 and 1.4 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>, respectively.
