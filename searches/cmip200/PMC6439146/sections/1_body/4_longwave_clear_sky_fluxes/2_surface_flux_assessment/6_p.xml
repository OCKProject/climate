<p id="Par45" class="p">Note that there are indications, that the official scale for longwave radiation issued by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) based on the World Infrared Standard Group (WISG) might somewhat underestimate the downward longwave radiation measured by the pyrgeometers, and may need to be recalibrated in the future (Nyeki et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">2017</xref>). This could potentially lead to surface downward and upward longwave fluxes which are higher by a few Wm
 <sup class="sup">âˆ’2</sup>. Until this issue is completely settled, which will require additional investigations to enhance the preliminary findings from so far four sites as well as the approval and adaptation by WMO and thus may take several years, the WISG scale will remain the reference for longwave measurements in the BSRN network.
