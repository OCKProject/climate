<p id="Par43" class="p">The multi-model mean biases in downward surface longwave clear-sky radiation at each of the 31 BSRN sites are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig" class="xref">11</xref> as blue bars in terms of their climatological annual mean biases. As in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>, the spread of model-calculated values at the single sites is further indicated by vertical lines covering ± one standard deviation and by the maximum positive and negative  model biases given as triangle symbols. At two-thirds of the stations, the multi-model mean bias is within 3 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> (blue bars in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig" class="xref">11</xref>). The mean and median of the multi-model mean biases over all sites correspond to 1.1 and 0.9 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>, respectively. This is remarkable given the amount of processing that went into the generation of both model-simulated and reference data.
