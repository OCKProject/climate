<p id="Par41" class="p">The simulated climatological mean annual cycles of downward surface longwave clear-sky radiation from the 37 CMIP5 models are compared in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig" class="xref">10</xref> with the BSRN reference climatologies at the 31 stations where such reference climatologies could be established (see Sect. 
 <xref rid="Sec3" ref-type="sec" class="xref">3</xref>, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). In Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig" class="xref">10</xref>a, the annual cycles of the models are again shown in red, whereas the BSRN reference climatologies are given in black. The associated differences between the model-calculated and observed annual cycles are displayed in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig" class="xref">10</xref>b. As in the shortwave (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>), the models overall reproduce the BSRN annual cycles reasonably well. This gives confidence in both model-simulated and observation-derived fluxes, which are completely independently obtained.
