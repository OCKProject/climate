<p id="Par40" class="p">In the following, the surface downward longwave clear-sky radiation fields of the CMIP5 GCMs are compared to the BSRN-derived clear-sky climatologies (c.f. Sect. 
 <xref rid="Sec3" ref-type="sec" class="xref">3</xref>). As with the shortwave, also the longwave clear-sky flux fields in the climate models stem from clear-sky calculations at each timestep, solely by removing the clouds if present, but otherwise retaining the atmospheric temperature and humidity structure (Method II according to Cess and Potter 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">1987</xref>), thus not only taking into account the atmospheric structure under true cloud-free conditions. However, unlike for the shortwave clear-sky assessment in Sect.Â 
 <xref rid="Sec6" ref-type="sec" class="xref">4.2</xref>, this states no problem for the comparison with the longwave BSRN reference climatologies. This is due to the fact that the algorithm that derives longwave clear-sky fluxes from the BSRN sites uses continuous measurements of air temperature and humidity regardless of whether clouds are present or not (Long and Turner 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">2008</xref>). Thus, the atmospheric conditions that enter the reference estimates are directly comparable to the ones that enter the GCM radiation codes, as both align with Method II, and thus there is no sampling issue. Therefore, unlike in the shortwave, no systematic sampling biases are apparent for the longwave clear-sky fluxes, and no further adjustments are required for an appropriate comparison of the simulated fluxes with the BSRN references.
