<p id="Par38" class="p">The clear-sky component in the longwave that can be directly compared with surface observations is the surface downward longwave clear-sky radiation. Global annual means of this quantity for each CMIP5 model are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9</xref> (upper panel). Compared to the net longwave clear-sky radiation shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref> (lower panel) the discrepancies amongst the model-calculated global means is further enhanced, now covering a dissatisfactory large range of 26 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>, with a standard deviation of 5.5 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9</xref> upper panel, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). This spread is even larger than in the corresponding all-sky global means of the same component, where the model spread covers a smaller range and standard deviation of 19 and 4.3 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9</xref> lower panel, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). This suggests that cloud effects may help to mask some of the discrepancies found in the longwave clear-sky fluxes simulated by the various CMIP5 models. This issue has already been noted in earlier generations of climate models (AMIPII, CMIP3) (Wild 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">2008</xref>), and suggests that the longwave emission from the cloud-free atmosphere towards the Earth surface is a major cause for the inter-model differences seen in the (all-sky) downward longwave radiation.
