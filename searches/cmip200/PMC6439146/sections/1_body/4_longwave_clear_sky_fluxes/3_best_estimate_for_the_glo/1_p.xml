<p id="Par48" class="p">As previously for the shortwave, we use in the following also the above longwave model biases to infer a best estimate of the global mean downward longwave clear-sky radiation at the Earth’s surface. This is again achieved by relating the model biases to their respective global mean numbers, but now for the longwave rather than the shortwave downward surface clear-sky radiation. This is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig" class="xref">13</xref>, where for each model its overall bias in the climatological annual downward surface longwave clear-sky radiation (as given in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig" class="xref">12</xref>) is plotted against its corresponding global annual mean value (as given in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9</xref> upper panel). As for the corresponding shortwave analysis, also in the longwave a tight relation between the two quantities can be noted, with a correlation coefficient of 0.88. The stronger the overestimation (underestimation) of the downward surface longwave clear-sky radiation at the BSRN sites in a model, generally also the higher (lower) its corresponding global mean value. Again we then infer a “best estimate” for the global mean downward surface longwave clear-sky radiation from the linear regression at the intersect where the bias against the surface observations becomes zero (dashed lines in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig" class="xref">13</xref>). Thereby we obtain a value of 313.7 (± 0.9) Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> (2σ uncertainty in the parentheses). Again the choice of the regression method (y-least squares and orthogonal regression) did not impact this value significantly (difference less than 0.2 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>). We consider therefore a value around 314 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> as best estimate for the global mean downward surface longwave clear-sky radiation.
