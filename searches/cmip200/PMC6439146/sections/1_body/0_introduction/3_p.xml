<p id="Par4" class="p">In previous studies (Wild et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" class="xref">2013</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">2015</xref>) we made an attempt to better constrain the radiative fluxes in the CMIP5 models under all-sky conditions, using to the extent possible the information contained in surface radiation measurement records. In the present, complementary study we specifically focus on the clear-sky radiative fluxes. Thereby, we will make use of clear-sky reference climatologies that we established from the high-quality radiation records measured at worldwide distributed stations from the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN, Ohmura et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">1998</xref>; Driemel et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">2018</xref>). We will then use these newly established references to assess the clear-sky fluxes simulated by the CMIP5 models.
