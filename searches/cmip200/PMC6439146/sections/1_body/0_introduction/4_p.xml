<p id="Par5" class="p">We will further use the emerging bias structure of the CMIP5 clear-sky fluxes with respect to the BSRN records to infer best estimates for the global mean surface shortwave and longwave clear-sky fluxes. We will then incorporate these estimates, together with TOA flux estimates from satellites, to establish a diagram of the global energy balance under cloud-free conditions, as presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>. By combining these estimates with the corresponding all-sky estimates determined in our earlier studies we will finally quantify the global cloud radiative effects not only at the TOA, but also within the atmosphere and at the surface.
