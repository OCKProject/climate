<p id="Par2" class="p">The global energy balance fundamentally constrains the energy fluxes in the Earth’s climate system. Radiative transfer through the atmosphere can be modified by both cloud-related processes and processes within the cloud-free atmosphere. In the cloud-free atmosphere, the shortwave fluxes stemming from the sun can be absorbed and/or scattered by gaseous and solid constituents, such as water vapor and other radiatively active gases as well as aerosols. Radiatively active gases are also mainly responsible for the longwave emission of the cloud-free atmosphere towards space and the Earth’s surface. For the quantification of the effects of clouds on the Earth’s energy balance, the precise magnitudes of the radiative fluxes both under “all-sky” (including clouds) and “clear-sky” (excluding clouds) conditions need to be known (Ramanathan
