 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" class="xref">2013</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">2015</xref>) the model-calculated flux climatologies stem from the “historical all forcings” experiments, which aim at reproducing the evolution of climate over the twentieth century as realistically as possible, considering all major natural and anthropogenic radiative forcings. These include changes in atmospheric greenhouse gases, aerosol loadings (tropospheric and stratospheric volcanic), solar output, and land use. Most of the CMIP5 historic experiments cover the period from the mid nineteenth century up to 2005.
