<p id="Par11" class="p">A detailed description of the models participating in CMIP5 is provided on the CMIP5 web-pages of the Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison (PCMDI) (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/</ext-link>). From most CMIP5 models multiple simulations of the historic experiments are available, which only differ in their initial conditions (ensemble experiments). However, the different ensemble members from a specific model hardly differ in terms of their clear-sky radiative flux climatologies (by less than 1 Wm
 <sup class="sup">âˆ’2</sup> on average), and the results presented in this study were found not to be sensitive to the choice of a particular ensemble member from a specific model. Therefore, results from only one ensemble realization of each model are presented in this study. This also avoids giving too much weight to specific models with large numbers of ensembles.
