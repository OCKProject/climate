<p id="Par7" class="p">In the present study we assess the clear-sky radiation climatologies as simulated by a variety of GCMs from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5), which provided the basis for the most recent (5th) IPCC assessment report (IPCC

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">2015</xref>), except for the following models which could not, or only partly, be considered in the present study due to incomplete clear-sky datasets: model versions CMCC-CESM, CMCC-CM, CMCC-CMS of the Centro Euro-Mediterraneo per I Cambiamenti Climatici (no surface shortwave and longwave clear-sky fluxes), CNRM-CM5 from the Centre National de Recherches Meteorologiques (wrong partitioning of shortwave clear-sky fluxes into downward and upward components over land), FGOALS-g2 from the Institute of Atmospheric Physics (corrupted surface downward clear-sky fluxes at poles, no surface shortwave clear-sky upward fluxes), and two versions of the Community Earth System Model, CESM1-CAM5 and CESM1-CAM5.1-FV2 (no surface clear-sky downward longwave fluxes). This leaves 38 and 37 CMIP5 models for the analysis of the shortwave and longwave clear-sky fluxes, respectively.
