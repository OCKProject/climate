<p id="Par10" class="p">The GCM clear-sky fluxes are determined at every time-step irrespective of the presence of clouds. During cloudy conditions, clear-sky fluxes are calculated by removing the clouds in the radiative transfer calculations, but otherwise retaining the atmospheric input structure (e.g. profiles of water vapor, temperature, aerosols) that prevail during these cloudy conditions. This is also known as “Method II” according to Cess and Potter (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">1987</xref>) and Potter et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">1992</xref>), whereas their definition of “Method I” refers to clear-sky climatologies which are only composed of truly cloud-free episodes. Clear-sky flux climatologies were established from the CMIP5 models as 5-year averages over the final complete years of their “historical all forcings” experiments, which correspond to the years 2000–2004. Since the year to year variations in the model-calculated clear-sky fluxes are small (the median annual variation at the various BSRN sites, defined as difference between the 5 and 95 percentiles, amounts to 2 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>), a 5-year mean gives a representative depiction of the model clear-sky flux climatologies at the beginning of the 21th century. To derive a correction, which ensures an adequate comparison between model-calculated (according to Method II above) and observed (according to Method I) shortwave clear-sky flux climatologies, we additionally made use of the multi-century unforced control simulations of the CMIP5 models, as well as an in-house simulation with the model MPI-ESM-LR (see Sect. 
 <xref rid="Sec4" ref-type="sec" class="xref">4</xref>). The latter allowed to store and investigate the clear-sky fluxes at higher temporal resolution (daily data) than provided by the CMIP5 archive (only monthly data).
