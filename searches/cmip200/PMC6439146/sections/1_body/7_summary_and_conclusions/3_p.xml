<p id="Par72" class="p">To derive best estimates for the global mean clear-sky radiative fluxes at the Earth’s surface we then applied the approach presented in Wild et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" class="xref">2013</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">2015</xref>) taking into account the bias structure of the 38 CMIP5 models with respect to the BSRN sites. The clear-sky radiative flux biases in the various models have thereby been linearly related to their respective global means. From the linear regression we inferred a best estimate (with zero bias against the surface observations) of 247 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> for the global mean downward shortwave radiation at the surface under cloud-free conditions, and a corresponding surface absorption of 214 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>, assuming a global mean surface albedo of 13.5%. Combined with a best estimate for the global net influx of shortwave radiation at the TOA under cloud-free skies from CERES-EBAF of 287 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>, this leaves 73 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> of shortwave radiation absorbed globally in the cloud-free atmosphere. This estimate nearly matches the completely independent estimates obtained from the state of the art satellite-retrieved dataset CERES-EBAF (Kato et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">2013</xref>), as well as from a Monte Carlo Aerosol-Cloud-Radiation (MACR) model assimilated with satellite-derived input (Kim and Ramanathan
