<p id="Par71" class="p">The subsequent assessment of the CMIP5 clear-sky surface flux climatologies at the BSRN sites identified a number of models with overall biases of no more than 1–2 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> in their shortwave and/or longwave downward flux climatologies. However there remain also a number of models with substantially larger overall flux biases, indicative of strong overestimations of the downward shortwave fluxes, as well as both overestimations and underestimations of the downward longwave fluxes, with systematic biases up to more than 10 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> when averaged over all BSRN sites.
