<p id="Par75" class="p">Accurate knowledge of the global radiation budget of the cloud-free atmosphere is a prerequisite to quantify the global cloud radiative effects, through a comparison with consistently derived “all-sky” global radiation budget estimates. Quantitative estimates of the global cloud radiative effects at the TOA, within the atmosphere and at the surface have thus been derived in the present study, which may also be of use in climate model assessments and tuning.</p>
