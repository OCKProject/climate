<p id="Par70" class="p">The global energy balance quantifies the distribution of radiative energy in the climate system. In previous studies we derived estimates for the magnitudes of the components of the “all-sky” global mean energy balance, taking into account the information provided by direct observations from surface and space as well as climate model estimates (Wild et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" class="xref">2013</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">2015</xref>). In the present study we made an attempt to derive complementary estimates for the global mean energy fluxes under cloud-free (“clear-sky”) conditions. While reference values for the energy fluxes in and out of the climate system under cloud-free conditions at the TOA are now available with high accuracy from satellite-based measurements (CERES EBAF), corresponding estimates for the atmospheric and surface clear-sky budgets are less straightforward to obtain. Yet such reference values are needed, since climate models still show considerable spreads in their simulated clear-sky budgets, particularly at the Earth surface. As outlined in this study, these model spreads amount already in the global mean to as much as 16 and 24 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> for the clear-sky surface downward shortwave and longwave radiation, respectively, which may further amplify on regional, seasonal and diurnal scales. We thus made an attempt to better constrain these fluxes using newly-derived clear-sky reference climatologies obtained at more than 50 worldwide distributed anchor sites from BSRN. The assessment has been slightly complicated by the fact that the monthly shortwave clear-sky BSRN reference climatologies are derived from measurements under truly cloud-free conditions, whereas the GCMs clear-sky fluxes are calculated continuously at every time-step solely by removing the clouds, yet otherwise retaining the prevailing atmospheric composition associated with the cloudy conditions. The quantitative effects of these different clear-sky definitions were estimated by comparing in multi-century GCM control simulations the clear-sky irradiances in months with lowest cloud amounts to their corresponding climatological mean clear-sky irradiances. The effects of the different clear-sky definitions between models and observations, estimated at 2 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> on average, were individually determined for each model and month and adjusted accordingly for a proper comparison with the reference climatologies.
