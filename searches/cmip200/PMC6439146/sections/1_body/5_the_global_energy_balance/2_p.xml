<p id="Par53" class="p">The currently most accurate estimates for the global mean clear-sky fluxes at the TOA as presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> can be obtained from the CERES EBAF dataset. We use here data from its latest Edition 4.0 (Loeb et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">2018</xref>), where the global annual mean estimates for the reflected shortwave clear-sky and outgoing longwave clear-sky fluxes amount to 53 and 268 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>, respectively. These values, however, are aggregated only from cloud-free scenes, and thus, similarly to the BSRN shortwave clear-sky climatologies discussed previously, may slightly differ from the computation of clear-sky TOA fluxes in climate models (c.f. Sect. 
 <xref rid="Sec6" ref-type="sec" class="xref">4.2</xref>). The effect of sampling over all types of atmospheric conditions as in climate models, rather than only over truly cloud-free conditions in the calculation of the global mean clear-sky fluxes have been estimated by Kato et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">2013</xref>) using the CERES EBAF framework. For the global mean shortwave reflected and outgoing longwave radiation at the TOA, Kato et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">2013</xref>) estimate this sampling effect at 0.24 and − 1.25 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>, respectively (their Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). This signifies, that considering not just the (slightly drier) atmospheres as under true clear-sky conditions, but all atmospheric conditions (with somewhat more water vapor content) in the calculation of the clear-sky fluxes, results in a slightly lower outgoing clear-sky longwave and slightly higher reflected clear-sky shortwave radiation at the TOA, as one would expect. To keep the clear-sky energy balance diagram consistent with the GCM definition of clear-sky fluxes (Method II), we therefore slightly adjusted the CERES TOA global mean values for Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> with the abovementioned corrections of 0.24 and − 1.25 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> in the shortwave and longwave, respectively. With these corrections, rounded to integers, the global mean clear-sky TOA shortwave reflected radiation remains at 53 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>, while the outgoing longwave radiation is slightly reduced to 267 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). The associated uncertainties of these estimates amount to ± 2 and ± 3 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>) (Loeb et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">2009</xref>). Combined with a global mean TOA insolation of 340 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> (solar constant divided by four to obtain the average TOA insolation on a square meter on the Earth’s sphere), the total amount of shortwave absorption under cloud-free conditions becomes 287 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>. Note that the cloud-free energy balance in the diagram shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> is not the balance that Earth would achieve in equilibrium when no clouds could form. As mentioned above the diagram is rather representative for the GCM-type of clear-sky fluxes determined by removing the clouds but otherwise retaining the entire atmospheric structure. As a consequence, unlike in the all-sky case, the TOA budget is far from being balanced between shortwave clear-sky absorption (287 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>) and longwave clear-sky emission (267 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>). In the all-sky budget (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig14" ref-type="fig" class="xref">14</xref> left, reproduced from Wild et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">2015</xref>) the difference between these two quantities is largely remediated by the global net cloud radiative effect.
