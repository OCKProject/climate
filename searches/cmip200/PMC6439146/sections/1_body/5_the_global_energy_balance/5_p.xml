<p id="Par56" class="p">The amount of shortwave radiation absorbed within the cloud-free atmosphere can then be determined as residual between the cloud-free absorption of shortwave radiation in the total (TOA) climate system (287 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>) and at the surface (214 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>), and thus amounts to 73 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>. The 73 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> of atmospheric shortwave clear-sky absorption closely match our previous estimates of this quantity which we obtained more than a decade ago based on older models and their biases against much fewer direct clear-sky observation (Wild et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" class="xref">2006</xref>). Two decades ago we estimated the global mean clear-sky atmospheric absorption similarly at 72 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>, not derived from clear-sky climatologies as they were not available at the time, but from a stand-alone evaluation of the radiation codes under cloud-free conditions used in the ECHAM3 and ECHAM4 climate models (Wild et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">1998</xref>). Also, from the completely independently derived CERES-EBAF Ed.4. satellite-derived dataset, the very same global mean atmospheric shortwave clear-sky absorption of 73 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> has been determined (Kato et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">2018</xref>) as in the present study. Further, in another independent approach, Kim and Ramanathan (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">2008</xref>) obtained a closely matching estimate of 72 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> for this quantity, by integrating global satellite-derived data sets for aerosols, water vapor and total ozone with a Monte Carlo Aerosol-Cloud-Radiation (MACR) model.
