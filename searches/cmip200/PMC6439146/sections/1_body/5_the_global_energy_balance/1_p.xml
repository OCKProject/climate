 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Note that the clear-sky flux magnitudes in this diagram are representative for an atmospheric structure corresponding to all-sky conditions but with clouds removed. This view thus corresponds to the climate model-type representation of clear-sky fluxes (Method II according to Cess and Potter 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">1987</xref>), and enables a direct comparison with the clear-sky budgets obtained from GCM output. It further allows the isolation and quantification of the effects of clouds on the global mean Earth radiation budget, by comparing the all-sky fluxes with the clear-sky fluxes merely obtained by removing the clouds, but with otherwise identical atmospheric conditions.
