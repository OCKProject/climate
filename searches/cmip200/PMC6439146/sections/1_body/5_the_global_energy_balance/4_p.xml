<p id="Par55" class="p">In our representation of the clear-sky energy balance we further retain the same radiative properties for the surface emission and surface albedo as in the discussion of the all-sky budget in Wild et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">2015</xref>), to be consistent. Using thus the global surface albedo of 13.5% from Wild et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">2015</xref>) and the best estimate of 247 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> for the global mean clear-sky shortwave downward radiation (Sect. 
 <xref rid="Sec7" ref-type="sec" class="xref">4.3</xref>), the global mean clear-sky surface shortwave absorption and reflection become 214 and 33 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). A detailed description of the derivation of the surface albedo value can be found in Wild et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">2015</xref>). Strictly speaking, the surface albedo under clear-skies slightly differs from the one under all-sky conditions, because the incident radiation under clear-skies is more directional particularly over ocean. According to the dataset of CERES EBAF surface, this effect is, however, small on a global mean basis, at 0.3% (Kato et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">2018</xref>, as can be derived from their Table 5). This corresponds to a change in surface shortwave reflection of only 0.7 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>, so that the magnitude of this flux rounded to integer remains at 33 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> as given in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>.
