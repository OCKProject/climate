<p id="Par58" class="p">The 73 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> derived here for the global mean clear-sky shortwave atmospheric absorption are distinctly higher than some of the earlier estimates, and many of the simulated values of this quantity in GCMs, particularly in older models. This fits to the evidence for a lack of shortwave atmospheric absorption in many of the GCM radiation codes compared to line-by-line reference codes in radiation code intercomparison projects spanning more than two decades (Fouquart et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">1991</xref>; Barker et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2003</xref>; Oreopoulos et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">2012</xref>). The situation in GCMs has somewhat improved over the years. While the global mean clear-sky shortwave atmospheric absorption in some of the GCMs of the early 1990s did not even reach 60 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> (Wild et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">1998</xref>), this quantity was gradually enhanced in subsequent GCM generations, to 67 and 69 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> in terms of multi-model means in the AMIPII and CMIP3 model intercomparison projects, respectively (Wild et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" class="xref">2006</xref>), and finally to 71 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> in the CMIP5 multi-model mean (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). This development is in line with the notion of an overall improvement in the performance of more recent GCM radiation codes in the context of the Continual Intercomparison of Radiation Codes (CIRC) compared to earlier assessments (Oreopoulos et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">2012</xref>). Increasing water vapor absorption, due to the improved description of the shortwave continuum absorption in the near-infrared windows and revised spectroscopic absorption coefficients, may favour this development (Radel et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">2015</xref>; Paynter and Ramaswamy 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">2012</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">2014</xref>; Kim and Ramanathan 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">2008</xref>). A more accurate description of the aerosol radiative properties in the GCM radiative transfer calculations may further contribute to the enhanced shortwave absorption (Ackerman et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">2003</xref>; Kim and Ramanathan 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">2008</xref>). Note that now about half of the CMIP5 models calculate a clear-sky atmospheric absorption that exceeds 70 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> middle panel), and are thus in close agreement with the best estimate supported here. Yet there are still a number of CMIP5 models with a substantially lower clear-sky atmospheric absorption (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> middle panel). This low absorption in some of these models may rather point to an inadequate implementation of known radiation physics in their radiation codes than to remaining genuine uncertainties in the representation of aerosols and the water vapor continuum.
