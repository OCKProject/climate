<p id="Par20" class="p">The large spread amongst the models remains if we consider the downward rather than the absorbed clear-sky fluxes at the surface which can directly be compared to the upward-oriented radiation sensors of the surface stations. In their global means, these clear-sky fluxes vary in a range of 13 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>, with a standard deviation of 3.7 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> upper panel, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). Interestingly, this inter-model spread is not that much smaller than the all-sky equivalent of the downward shortwave radiation, despite neglecting cloud effects (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> lower panel, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>).
