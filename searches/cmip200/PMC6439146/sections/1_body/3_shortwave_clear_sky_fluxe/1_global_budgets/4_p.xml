<p id="Par19" class="p">No similarly trusted reference values are available for the global mean shortwave absorption under cloud-free conditions at the Earth surface. Accordingly, model estimates differ in a larger range (16 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>) and with a larger standard deviation (3.6 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>) than their TOA counterparts, despite the absolute values being lower by about 25% (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> lower panel). The global mean absorption of shortwave radiation in the cloud-free atmosphere also varies between different models in a range of 11 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>, middle panel), which corresponds to 17% of their absolute values spread around 70 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>, and with a standard deviation of 2.9 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>).
