<p id="Par16" class="p">Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> shows the global annual mean clear-sky budgets as simulated by 38 CMIP5 GCMs at the surface (bottom panel), within the atmosphere (middle panel) and at the TOA (upper panel). The budgets at the TOA that govern the total amount of clear-sky absorption in the climate system, are to some extent tuned to match the CERES reference value, given at 287 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> for the global mean TOA shortwave clear-sky absorption. Accordingly, the corresponding quantity in the CMIP5 multi-model mean, at 288.6 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>, closely matches the CERES reference (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). Between the individual models, this quantity varies in a range of 10 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>, with a standard deviation of 2.1 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>, and with a maximum deviation of 5 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> from the CERES reference value (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> upper panel).
