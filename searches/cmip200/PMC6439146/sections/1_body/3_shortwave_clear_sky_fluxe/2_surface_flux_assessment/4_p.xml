<p id="Par25" class="p">Model-calculated climatologies of the annual cycles of downward surface shortwave clear-sky radiation from the 38 CMIP5 models, slightly adjusted according to the above procedure to ensure a proper comparison with the reference climatologies, are compared in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> with the BSRN reference climatologies at 53 stations. In Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>a the mean annual cycles of the 38 models are shown in red, whereas the annual cycles of the BSRN reference climatologies are given in black. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>b displays the associated differences between the simulated and observed mean annual cycles for each model. Note the smooth shapes of the annual cycles in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>a which are characteristic for clear-sky climatologies. Overall the models reproduce the reference annual cycles reasonably well, with monthly biases of no more than 10–20 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>. Only at a few stations, large differences can be noted, mostly in the summer months with high absolute values. Substantial model spread can be seen at desert sites which are heavily influenced by aerosols [ilo: Ilorin (Nigeria), tam: Tamanrasset (Algeria), sov: Solar Village (Saudi Arabia)].
