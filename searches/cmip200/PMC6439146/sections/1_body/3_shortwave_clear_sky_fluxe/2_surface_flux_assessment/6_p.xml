<p id="Par27" class="p">The climatological annual mean differences between model-calculated and observed downward surface shortwave clear-sky radiation at each of the 53 BSRN sites are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>. The blue bars denote multi-model mean differences between the model-calculated and reference clear-sky climatologies at each individual BSRN station. The spread of model-calculated values at each site is further indicated by vertical lines covering ± one standard deviation, and by the maximum positive and negative model biases given as triangle symbols. There is an overall tendency that the models overestimate the downward surface shortwave clear-sky fluxes compared to the BSRN references, with a multi-model mean overestimation at 35 out of the 53 sites (two-third of the sites). The multi-model mean and median overestimation with respect to the 53 sites is 2.9 and 2.3 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>, respectively. There is, however, a considerable fraction, namely 20 sites with multi-model mean biases of no more than 1 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>. This is remarkable given the complex processing that stands behind both model and reference data. At two sites, both located in Brazil (brb and ptr), the multi-model mean differences are particularly high. Although there is the possibility that the models underestimate the absorption by aerosols from biomass burning in these areas we cannot entirely rule out the possibility of a measurement problem at these remote sites. Without considering these two sites, the abovementioned multi-model mean bias reduces by 0.7 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> to 2.3 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>, whereas the median bias is hardly affected.
