<p id="Par24" class="p">We had also the chance to double check the magnitude of this adjustment further, by analysing daily rather than monthly data from a 150-year long control simulation that we performed in-house with one particular model, the MPI-ESM-LR. Thereby we compared model-calculated clear-sky fluxes from the most cloudless days with the respective clear-sky fluxes averaged over all corresponding days from this simulation, for each day of the year. A similar deviation on the order of 2 Wm
