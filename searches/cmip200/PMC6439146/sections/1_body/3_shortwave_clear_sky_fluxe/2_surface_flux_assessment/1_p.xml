<p id="Par22" class="p">To better constrain the unsatisfactory large spread in the model calculated shortwave clear-sky fluxes at the surface noted above, we use the clear-sky reference climatologies established from records compiled at 53 BSRN sites (see Sect.

Thereby the model-calculated fields of clear-sky downward shortwave radiation were interpolated to the coordinates of the BSRN stations taking into account the four distance-weighed surrounding grid points. The random error induced by the comparison of point observations with gridded shortwave flux products with a resolution of 1° as typically found in GCMs has been estimated by Hakuba et al. (
