<p id="Par29" class="p">The overall biases of the individual CMIP5 models when averaged over all 53 sites are given in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>. They largely vary between models, in a range of 13 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>, which is not unexpected given the large model discrepancies already in their global mean downward surface shortwave clear-sky radiation (c.f. Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> upper panel). Most models (32 out of 38) show an overestimation. Averaged over all 38 models, this overestimation amounts to 2.9 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>, while the median model overestimation is 2.2 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>. Again, excluding the two Brazilian sites would reduce the overestimation by about 0.7 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>. It is also noteworthy that more than half of the models show an overall bias compared to the BSRN references of no more than 2 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>. The overestimation of the downward surface shortwave clear-sky radiation has been a long-standing issue in climate models, as inferred in earlier studies from fewer observational references and older models compared to the present study (Wild et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">1995</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">1998</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" class="xref">2006</xref>). An underestimation of water–vapor absorption in the GCM radiation codes, related to uncertainties in the spectroscopic absorption coefficients and the formulation of the near-infrared water vapor continuum, as well as inaccuracies in the representation of aerosol characteristics and burdens have been put forward as potential causes for the overestimation of the downward surface shortwave clear-sky radiation (Wild et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">1998</xref>; Morcrette 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">2002</xref>; Pincus et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">2015</xref>; Paynter and Ramaswamy

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">2014</xref>; Radel et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">2015</xref>). This is also in line with findings of the Continual Intercomparison of Radiation Codes (CIRC, Oreopoulos and Mlawer 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">2010</xref>) and preceding radiation code intercomparison projects (Fouquart et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">1991</xref>). While these intercomparison projects were useful to identify radiation codes which do not adequately represent well-established radiation physics [e.g., some radiation codes entirely neglect the N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O and CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> absorption (Collins et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">2006</xref>)], they may not be able to nail down uncertainties induced by incompletely understood physics such as aspects of the water vapor continuum or aerosol optical properties. Additional biases in the model-calculated downward surface shortwave clear-sky radiation could potentially be introduced by inadequacies in the simulated amount of water vapor (precipitable water) in the CMIP5 model atmospheres, which is used as input to the radiation schemes. Indeed there is recent evidence that the CMIP5 atmosphere are globally too dry, on average by about 6% when compared to satellite-derived references (Takahashi 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">2018</xref>). However, the impact of a dry bias of this magnitude on the downward surface shortwave clear-sky radiation is likely less than 1 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> (Wild 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">2009</xref>).
