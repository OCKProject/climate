<p id="Par23" class="p">The comparison is complicated by the fact that the monthly shortwave clear-sky BSRN reference climatologies are derived from measurements under truly cloud-free conditions, whereas the GCM clear-sky fluxes are calculated continuously at every time-step solely by removing the clouds, yet otherwise retaining the prevailing atmospheric composition (e.g. water vapor, temperature, aerosols) during the cloudy conditions. As mentioned in Sect. 
 <xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec" class="xref">2</xref>, the former method of determining the clear-sky fluxes is also known in the literature as Method I, whereas the latter is referred to as Method II (Cess and Potter 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">1987</xref>; Potter et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">1992</xref>). These different definitions of clear-skies in models and observations give rise to potentially spurious biases in the GCMs with respect to the reference climatologies due to the additional sampling of clear-sky fluxes calculated under atmospheric conditions representative for cloudy situations. Thereby, the different sampling may result in a wet bias in the GCMs compared to the clear-sky reference climatologies, which may induce some spurious additional shortwave atmospheric absorption, thus potentially leading to downward clear-sky shortwave fluxes that are biased artificially somewhat low compared to “true” clear-sky conditions. To obtain an estimate of the magnitude of this potential spurious sampling bias, an obvious procedure would be to compose clear-sky climatologies from the model fluxes only out of situations when true clear-sky conditions prevail. However, this would require access to raw model output at high temporal resolution (ideally at the model time step), yet this is not available from the CMIP5 archive. To nevertheless get a sense of whether the different definitions of clear-skies in models and observations could be of any relevance, we applied the following methodology (Ott 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">2017</xref>): We took from all CMIP5 models used in the present study monthly data from their very long unforced control runs, which typically cover many centuries of integration. Within these multi-century simulations of each model, we searched for the specific month with the least cloud amount, for each month of the year separately (i.e. the January with the least cloud amount out of all Januarys in the control run (typically several hundreds), and similar for each other month of the year through to December). The aim thereby was to approximate as best as we can on a monthly basis true clear-sky conditions. We then took the associated model clear-sky fluxes of these particularly cloud-free months, and compared them to the corresponding long term climatological mean clear-sky fluxes as averaged over the entire control run. This can give an idea to what extent the model-calculated monthly fluxes under as cloudless as possible conditions deviate from the corresponding clear-sky fluxes calculated under all types of cloud conditions. These deviations have been determined for each model at each BSRN station, and were subsequently used as corrections to adjust the simulated downward shortwave flux climatologies individually for each model and each station. On average, the deviations were found to be relatively modest, on the order of 2 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>, with the clear-sky fluxes of the months with lowest cloudiness systematically slightly higher than under all type of cloud conditions, as expected due to the dryer atmosphere of the former.
