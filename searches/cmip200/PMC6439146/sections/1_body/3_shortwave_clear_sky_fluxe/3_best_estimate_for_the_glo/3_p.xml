 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" class="xref">2017</xref>) to doublecheck the robustness of our method with respect to the station distribution, as the observational records in GEBA are only available at monthly resolution and thus do not allow for the establishment of clear-sky climatologies. In Wild et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" class="xref">2013</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">2015</xref>) we could show that for all-sky conditions our regression method to obtain the best estimates of the global mean downward fluxes is fairly robust with respect to the choice of independent reference datasets with differing station distributions. Robust results are expected from our regression method if no major common systematic geographical dependencies are present in the bias structures of the simulated flux climatologies, which could be missed by the BSRN network. We did not find any such dependencies in the clear-sky biases amongst the various CMIP5 models, such as latitudinal dependencies, differences in biases in polar versus tropical sites, or sites in maritime versus terrestrial environments etc., with the one exception of the outlier biases at the two Brazilian sites mentioned above. Therefore we believe that also our clear-sky estimates should be fairly robust, even though we cannot rule out the possibility that undetected outstanding biases in undersampled regions could affect the results.
