<p id="Par34" class="p">As in our previous study (Wild et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">2015</xref>), to obtain a conservative uncertainty range for our best estimate, we expand the 2σ regression uncertainty range given above to additionally cover all global mean clear-sky estimates from those GCMs which show only marginal biases compared to the surface stations. This accounts for the fact that any global mean estimate stemming from a GCM with only marginal overall biases against the surface sites strictly cannot be disqualified by our approach. Specifically, in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref> we note also global mean clear-sky downward solar radiation values spreading from 246 to 250 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> which belong to GCMs with marginal overall biases (defined here as smaller than 1 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>), and which accordingly defines the uncertainty range of this quantity in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>.
