<p id="Par31" class="p">We now make use of the bias structure of the CMIP5 models with respect to the BSRN references to infer a best estimate for the global mean downward surface shortwave clear-sky radiation. We thereby apply the methodology presented in Wild et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" class="xref">2013</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">2015</xref>) for all-sky fluxes now to the clear-sky fluxes, and relate the diverging values in global mean downward surface shortwave clear-sky radiation of the various CMIP5 models (as given in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>) to their respective biases (as given in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). Therefore, in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>, each cross represents one CMIP5 model with its global annual mean downward surface shortwave clear-sky radiation on the vertical axis and its overall climatological bias in this quantity compared to the 53 BSRN sites on the horizontal axis. A very tight connection between the global means and the corresponding biases of the downward surface shortwave clear-sky radiation calculated by the various models is evident, as reflected in a high correlation coefficient of 0.94. Thus, generally, the more a climate model overestimates the downward surface shortwave clear-sky radiation compared to the BSRN references, the higher is also its corresponding global mean value. A linear regression can then be used to determine the hypothetical global mean value that would correspond to a zero bias against the observational references (dashed lines in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>). The value that fits to the zero bias according to the linear regression is 246.6 (± 0.6) Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> (2σ uncertainty given in the parentheses). We thus take this value as our best estimate for the global annual mean downward surface shortwave clear-sky radiation. Note that in the bias calculations the two suspicious Brazilian sites are included. Excluding these two sites puts the best estimate to 247.3 (± 0.6) Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>. This suggests a value near 247 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> as best estimate for the global annual mean downward surface shortwave clear-sky radiation. We further tested two different ways of calculating the regression in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>, namely a y-least squares and an orthogonal regression, but this had only a marginal influence of less than 0.2 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> on the best estimate derived here.
