<p id="Par60" class="p">The clear-sky radiation balance derived in the previous section can then be used as a reference state to isolate and quantify the overall radiative effects of clouds, through a comparison with the corresponding all-sky radiation balance. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig14" ref-type="fig" class="xref">14</xref> contrasts the two radiation budgets, including clouds (left, as estimated in Wild et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">2015</xref>) and excluding clouds (right, as estimated in the present study). This not only allows the estimation of the overall effects of clouds on the global mean radiation budget at the TOA, but also within the atmosphere and at the Earth’ surface, as given in Fig.
