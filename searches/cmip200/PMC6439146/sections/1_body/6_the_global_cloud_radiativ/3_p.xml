 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">2018</xref>), at 287 and 240 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>, respectively, differs by 47 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>. This suggests that the overall effect of clouds is to reduce the absorption of shortwave radiation in the climate system by − 47 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> (TOA shortwave cloud radiative effect). Since the cloud radiative effect is defined as the difference between the all-sky and clear-sky fluxes, and since this indicates a cooling of the climate system, this value obtains a negative sign (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig15" ref-type="fig" class="xref">15</xref>). Accordingly, the longwave cloud radiative effect at the TOA, as the difference between the outgoing longwave radiation under all-sky and clear-sky conditions determined from CERES-EBAF Edition 4.0, becomes positive at 28 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>, since this states an energy gain for the climate system (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig15" ref-type="fig" class="xref">15</xref>). The net (shortwave and longwave combined) cloud radiative effect at the TOA then results in an overall energy loss of − 19 Wm
