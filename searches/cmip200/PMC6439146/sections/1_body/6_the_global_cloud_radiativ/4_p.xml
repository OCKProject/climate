<p id="Par63" class="p">In addition to these widely published TOA cloud radiative effects, our study further allows the estimation of the global mean shortwave, longwave and net cloud radiative effects within the atmosphere and at the surface in a similar way, based on the respective all-sky and clear-sky estimates given in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig14" ref-type="fig" class="xref">14</xref>. At the surface the shading effects of clouds are estimated to reduce the downward shortwave radiation globally from 247 to 185 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>, thus by − 62 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>. In terms of absorbed (net) shortwave radiation at the Earth surface, the reduction by clouds amounts to − 54 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> globally (from 214 to 160 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>), which corresponds to the net surface shortwave cloud radiative effect (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig15" ref-type="fig" class="xref">15</xref>). On the other hand, clouds are estimated to enhance the global mean surface downward longwave radiation by 28 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>, from 314 to 342 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig15" ref-type="fig" class="xref">15</xref>). The same amount applies also to the net surface longwave cloud radiative effect (i.e. the cloud effect on the net longwave balance at the surface), since the all-sky and clear-sky upward longwave radiation is nearly identical within this framework (see discussion above). The surface net cloud radiative effect, defined as the sum of the surface net shortwave and longwave cloud effects, thus amounts then to − 26 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> globally (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>).
