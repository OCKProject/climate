 <p class="p">Work on the Global Energy Balance at ETH is supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation Grant 20002_159938/1 (Towards an improved understanding of the Global Energy Balance: temporal variations of solar radiation in the climate system). Atsumu Ohmura, Gert König-Langlo, and Amelie Driemel are highly acknowledged for establishing and maintaining the BSRN Archive over many years. Atsumu Ohmura’s deep insight into the energy balance data is highly valued. The global energy balance diagrams shown in this paper were designed by Barbara Schär. We acknowledge the international modeling groups for providing their data for analysis, the Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison (PCMDI) for collecting and archiving the model data, the JSC/CLIVAR Working Group on Coupled Modeling (WGCM) and their Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) and Climate Simulation Panel for organizing the model data analysis activity. The simulation with the climate model MPI-ESM-LR referred to in this study has been performed at the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre (CSCS) whose support is greatly acknowledged. We also wish to extend heartfelt appreciation to those individuals responsible for the long-term continuous operation and maintenance of the instruments and facilities that produced the quality observations used in this study; their diligent and dedicated efforts are often underappreciated.</p>
