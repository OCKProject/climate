  <p class="p">Schematic representation of the global annual mean energy balance of the Earth under cloud-free conditions. Numbers indicate best estimates for the magnitudes of the globally averaged clear-sky energy balance components together with their uncertainty ranges, representing present day climate conditions at the beginning of the new millennium. Estimates based on discussion in Sect.

It rather represents the global mean fluxes as determined solely by removing the clouds but otherwise retaining the entire atmospheric structure (i.e. the GCM representation of clear-sky fluxes, also known as Method II according to Cess and Potter
