<p class="p">As the applications of Earth system models move from general climate projections toward questions of mitigation and adaptation (Lawrence et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>) the more comprehensive representation of land management practices becomes crucial. A corresponding trend toward a more comprehensive representation of land use generally, and land management in particular, in ESMs is clearly discernable. This development can be guided by a prioritization of land management practices based on their importance for the Earth system, the possibility of technical implementation in the model, and data availability. Our review of these aspects reveals some “low‐hanging fruits” such as a basic implementation of crop harvest and residue management, nitrogen fertilization, and forestry harvest, where existing model structures are mostly sufficient to capture certain key effects on the Earth system and the required additional input variables can be derived from observational or statistical datasets.
