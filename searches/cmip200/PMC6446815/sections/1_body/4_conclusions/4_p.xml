<p class="p">Extending ESMs to a more comprehensive representation of land management effects will in the near future lead to model divergence as the planned paths of model development and prioritization differ between modeling groups. It will, however, allow for a more accurate description of the human impact on the Earth system as long as the multimodel assessments required to overcome model biases are based on selecting models with comparable representation of land management practices. A multitude of observational datasets can be included for evaluation purposes that were not meaningful in earlier‚Äêgeneration models, because earlier models lacked a detailed representation of vegetation processes that are relevant for land management practices and captured by Earth observations. To achieve a comprehensive inclusion of land management in ESMs a continuous collaboration of the modeling community, Earth observation community, as well as land system science is required beyond the identification of challenges and opportunities provided by this study.</p>
