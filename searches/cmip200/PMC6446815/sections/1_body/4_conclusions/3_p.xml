<p class="p">Our review also pinpoints the need for additional research in specific communities: the implementation, even in a simple form, of the most extensive land management practice—grazing and mowing harvest—is severely hampered by the lack of high‐quality data, and data availability reveals substantial gaps for almost all of the land management practices assessed in this study when the aim is to capture their effects in a comprehensive way. A lack of process understanding is complicating implementation of practices that otherwise can be easily linked to existing model structures and datasets (such as crop species selection and tillage for a basic implementation). Finally, while some key effects of most land management practices can be captured without major extension of ESMs to additional structures, major model development will be the challenge for a comprehensive representation of biogeophysical and biogeochemical effects.</p>
