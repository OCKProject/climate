<p class="p">While it must be expected that in the medium term, as models start to implement different land management practices, model spread will increase, the common trend toward high complexity (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>) suggests that models eventually converge on a more homogeneous accounting for land‐use conversions and land management processes alike. Currently, studies applying several LSMs for their estimates of land‐use change impacts on surface climate and biogeochemical fluxes typically rely on multimodel mean and spread for a best estimate (e.g., Le Quéré et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) despite the fact that the amount and types of land‐use and land management practices differ across models. For example, in LUCID‐CMIP5 (“Land‐Use and Climate, IDentification of robust impacts” in CMIP5) only three of six models accounted for pasture as a specific plant functional type, three models accounted for subgrid scale transitions, and one model accounted for wood harvest (Brovkin et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). The inclusion of more land management practices will in the future allow to form larger ensembles of models that account for the same processes, as currently part of the spread across models must still be attributed to different land‐use change processes included (Houghton et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Moving toward a greater comprehensiveness will also facilitate evaluation of models against observations. For instance, Nyawira, Nabel, Don, Brovkin, and Pongratz (
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0080" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>) found that the observed sign of soil carbon changes for forest‐cropland transitions could be simulated by a LSM only after the inclusion of crop harvesting.
