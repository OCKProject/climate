<p class="p">Ongoing activities aim at moving ESMs toward an extension of biogeochemical cycles and greenhouse‐gas fluxes beyond carbon, but also to implement more detail on agricultural management (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Some land management practices, such as fertilization and irrigation, are well captured by crop models (e.g., Brisson et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>), and currently move to the focus of the ESM community due to the emerging empirical evidence of their substantial biogeophysical (in particular for irrigation) and biogeochemical effects (in particular for fertilization, grazing, and residue management) (see Erb, Luyssaert, et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>, for a detailed review).
