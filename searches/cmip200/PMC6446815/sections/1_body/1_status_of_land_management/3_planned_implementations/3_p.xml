<p class="p">With these plans, there is a clear trend toward a more complete representation of land‐use change, including land management effects, in ESMs from the current state to the perspective beyond CMIP6 (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). A tendency appears for models to compensate for their “weaknesses” first by improving on the aspect, either forestry or agricultural management, which was more coarsely represented before (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). It needs to be noted that development paths across models have similarities because dependencies of certain processes on others are the same for all models, for example, the requirement of a nitrogen cycle for fertilization (see also Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). The long‐term consequence of the planned developments is a convergence of models toward a detailed representation of land management. However, on the timescales covered here (several years beyond CMIP6) the diversity and amount of processes that can be represented in the face of limited resources will keep models dissimilar (the models do not converge yet at the highest complexity in Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). Representation of the same process also differs between models, meaning that even models with the same degree of complexity can exhibit marked differences in their simulated behavior and sensitivity. The development path taken by each model to add a more comprehensive representation of land management thus differs based on current capabilities and different prioritization.
