<p class="p">We conducted a survey among modeling groups participating in international studies including land‐use change (SOM text 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-sup-0003" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref>). Hence, by design, all 17 models who participated currently represent land‐use change in some form. Prior to the inclusion of land‐use change, ESMs typically already included a submodel for natural vegetation processes, to account for processes such as changes in biogeographical distribution of natural vegetation or wildfires (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Yet, this does not imply that the link between natural processes and land‐use change is well developed. For instance, models disagree on if and how fire should be represented on managed areas (e.g., Rabin et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0090" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>) and few models feature an explicit interaction of natural and anthropogenic land‐cover modifications, such as the preferential allocation of pasture on natural grasslands (e.g., Schneck, Reick, Pongratz, &amp; Gayler,
