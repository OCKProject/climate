<p class="p">As climate models moved toward ESMs, the carbon cycle was included to prognostically calculate the atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration and capture this dominant driver of anthropogenic climate change (Flato et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). The carbon cycle is thus represented more frequently than nitrogen or phosphorus cycles. In fact, simulated land surface emissions of non‐CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> greenhouse gases are implemented in only around one‐third of all models considered in our survey (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Forest and crop harvest and the corresponding product pools as well as subgrid scale transitions, which all directly alter vegetation and soil carbon stocks, are the most common processes related to land management that are considered in current ESMs (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). It is worth emphasizing that the development of increasingly complex biophysical models on the one hand and biogeochemistry models on the other hand not necessarily implies that the two are integrated. For example, only three of nine participating models also include tree age classes, but a representation of forest structure is needed to capture the biophysical effects of wood harvest in addition to the biogeochemical effect (e.g., Otto et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0083" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Similarly, models might represent the release of carbon from fires while the feedback on the biophysical part through albedo may not exist in the model (e.g., Lasslop, Thonicke, &amp; Kloster,
