<p class="p">Despite the small number of IAMs participating in our survey, some clear differences and common features emerge in the treatment of land management between ESMs and IAMs: Forest and crop harvest are important practices also in IAMs (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>), although the focus is on their socioeconomic importance, rather than for carbon cycling as in the ESMs. This different focus of IAMs and ESMs is reflected in the subordinate role of processes related to natural vegetation and vegetation dynamics in IA modeling (Figure
