<p class="p">We lack, however, an assessment of ways to implement land management practices in current ESM structures. Further, data availability needs to be matched with modeling needs to guide prioritization in the observational community for collection of additional datasets. This study will address these gaps. Here, we focus on implementing the ten land management practices that were selected by Erb, Luyssaert, etÂ al. (
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>) based on their global prevalence across a diversity of biomes and the strength of their biogeophysical and biogeochemical effects on the Earth system, as described in the literature. These 10 land management practices are: (1) forestry harvest; (2) tree species selection; (3) grazing and mowing harvest; (4) crop harvest and crop residue management; (5) crop species selection; (6) fertilization of cropland and grazing land; (7) tillage; (8) crop irrigation (including paddy rice irrigation); (9) artificial drainage of wetlands for agricultural purposes; and (10) fire as a management tool. We will discuss the status of implementation of land management in ESMs, possible implementation approaches for these ten practices, and data availability for model input and evaluation. This study will thus identify challenges and opportunities for the assessment of land management effects in Earth system research and allow for a comprehensive prioritization of various land management practices.
