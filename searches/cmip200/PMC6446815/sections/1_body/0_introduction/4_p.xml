<p class="p">Earth system models (ESMs) have become key tools to assess how land‐use change has affected the climate in the historical past and how it may affect the climate for future scenarios. The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5), which provided the simulations underlying the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 5th Assessment Report, was the first CMIP that included spatially explicit maps of land‐use change as a forcing (Hurtt et al.,

At this stage, models were limited in the types of land‐use change represented: Most models represented anthropogenic conversions in land use, typically those that also result in land‐cover conversions such as the clearing of natural vegetation for cropland expansion (Boysen et al.,

 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). These are relevant for about 18‐29% of the ice‐free land surface, while land management, inducing both land‐cover conversions and modifications, affects about 71%–76% of the land (Luyssaert et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0069" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Nevertheless, the effects of land management were practically absent in CMIP5. Only some ESMs accounted for land management practices like wood harvest (e.g., Shevliakova et al.,
