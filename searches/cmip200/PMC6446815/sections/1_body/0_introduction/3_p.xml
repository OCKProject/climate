<p class="p">This requires bridging different Earth system science disciplines, particularly the climate change and land system science communities, and establishing a common terminology. Here, we use the term land‐use change as an umbrella to entail both conversion from one broad land‐use class to another (e.g., from forestry to cropping) and changes in land management within one land‐use class (e.g., intensification of cropping). Importantly, this moves beyond simplified definitions that defined land‐use change by its impact on land cover to define land‐use change more comprehensively and mechanistically (see Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Both land‐use conversions and land management impact the climate through biogeochemical and biogeophysical pathways.
