<p class="p">Three quarters of the Earth's ice‐free land surface are in some form managed by humans (Luyssaert et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0069" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). While this provides essential food, fiber, energy, and living space for about 7 billion people (Haberl et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>), the extent and magnitude of land‐use change impacts key Earth system processes, including the climate, in major ways. Global climate change has been accelerated by greenhouse‐gas emissions from land‐use changes, with about one‐third of all anthropogenic CO

 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>). In addition, changes in albedo, energy fluxes, and water fluxes induce changes in surface climate as important locally as those induced by the increased global greenhouse‐gas concentration (de Noblet‐Ducoudré et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0078" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>), which can feed back on atmospheric dynamics on regional scale (Winckler, Reick, &amp; Pongratz,
