<p class="p">For these reasons moving beyond conversions in land use that induce land‐cover conversions to also represent land management has become a key priority for Earth system modeling. This is also reflected in additional data layers provided for CMIP6 and proposed simulations that isolate management effects and compare them across models (Lawrence et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Assessments of regional land management strategies with promise to help mitigate and/or adapt to climate change are envisaged within the Land Use Model Intercomparison Project (LUMIP) (Lawrence et al.,
