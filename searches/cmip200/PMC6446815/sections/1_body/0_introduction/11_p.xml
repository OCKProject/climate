<p class="p">The first two of these criteria are related to the prospective impact of the land management practice on the Earth system, the third and fourth to the implementation in ESMs, with the last relating to data availability for any realistic simulation. Studies have assessed the spatial extent of various practices and gathered evidence of land management effects (see Luyssaert et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0069" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>; and Erb, Luyssaert, et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>; for reviews). A recent study has reviewed the current state of knowledge of major land management practices with respect to the level of process understanding of Earth system impacts and data availability of the underlying drivers (Erb, Luyssaert, et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>).
