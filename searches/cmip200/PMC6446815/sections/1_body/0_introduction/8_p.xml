<p class="p">A model extension toward land management further provides a direct link between ESMs and integrated assessment modeling (IAM) by sharing common input and output variables, such as amount of irrigation and fertilization or forest and agricultural yields. Land management thus provides a way to test and improve the consistency between these two types of models. IAMs and ESMs have so far been linked only loosely due to both methodological and data challenges (Prestele et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0087" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>) and the fact that feedbacks between environmental and human systems in many cases are small (Van Vuuren et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0127" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). However, land management and land‐use conversions are a prime example for where these feedbacks may be non‐negligible because of the tight coupling of the land surface with the atmosphere and of the land surface state with human decision making (Van Vuuren et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0127" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). First attempts at synchronously coupling IAMs and ESMs therefore exist (e.g., Collins et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) and show, for example, a decrease in projected managed area when beneficial effects on plant productivity such as increasing atmospheric CO

 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0119" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>).
