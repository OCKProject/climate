<p class="p">The large variety in crop species can be captured by extending the existing model PFTs with crop functional types representing the most widespread agricultural plant traits (Bondeau et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). If the model already includes crop PFTs, allowing it to treat crops differently than natural vegetation (crop harvest, irrigation, N fertilization, …), no additional structures are needed (Bondeau et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>; Lokupitiya et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0068" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>; de Noblet‐Ducoudré et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0079" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>). The targeted species‐specific parameters are similar to the ones for tree species selection (see Section 3.1.2); however, additional parameters related to the development of yield‐bearing organs can be included. This approach should allow for capturing crop differences in yield, soil organic matter accumulation, nitrogen and phosphorus uptake, evapotranspiration, and phenology. The latter is important as it includes crop‐specific sowing dates, which can determine harvest date and seasonal changes in albedo (Sacks &amp; Kucharik, 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0098" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). Similar to crop harvest (see Section 3.1.4), evaluation can be done against yield data, and additionally against MODIS albedo and evapotranspiration (Loarie, Lobell, Asner, Mu, &amp; Field, 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0066" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>).
