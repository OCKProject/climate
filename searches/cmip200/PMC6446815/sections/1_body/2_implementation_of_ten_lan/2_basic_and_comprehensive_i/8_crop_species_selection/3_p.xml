<p class="p">The combination of the above described crop‐specific parameterization and the implementation of mixed stands (see comprehensive implementation in Section 3.1.2.) would allow to simulate intercropping (i.e., concurrently growing multiple (crop) species to maximize resource usage) and agroforestry (i.e., if one of the species is a tree) (Brisson, Bussiere, Ozier‐Lafontaine, Tournebize, &amp; Sinoquet, 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>). Agroforestry in different forms may represent an important form of land management, but data are particularly scarce. A recent analysis reveals that about 43% of cropland areas, measured as 1 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> gridcells, had at least 10% tree cover in 2010 (Zomer et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0136" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). A certain fraction of this tree cover consists of patches of cropland interspersed with wood patches, but agroforestry may play a significant role. Beside parameter sets for crop functional types, information on crop type distribution and rotation schemes is needed.
