<p class="p">We outline possible approaches of implementation of the ten management practices to assess the required implementation efforts and associated need for data. The starting point for the suggested approaches is a typical land surface component of an ESM that is capable of representing land‐cover conversions (Boysen et al.,

 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). We acknowledge that individual models may differ substantially in their process description, but common histories and fundamental approaches (Fisher, Huntzinger, Schwalm, &amp; Sitch, 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) allow for capturing common features across a wide range of models. While many effects of certain land management practices require no structures beyond those contained in typical LSMs, but only additional detail (e.g., the introduction of product carbon pools for harvested material in parallel to existing soil and vegetation carbon pools), other effects require processes to be implemented that were previously ignored or implicitly parameterized (such as prognostic groundwater storage).
