<p class="p">A comprehensive approach would require that models distinguish between mineral and organic soils (Letts, Roulet, Comer, Skarupa, &amp; Verseghy,

Drainage could still be represented by removing water from the soil layer that corresponds to the typical depth of a drainage channel. The effects of a reduced soil water content on greenhouse‐gas emissions and transpiration can then be simulated by the existing process representation in the model. Both basic and comprehensive implementations require knowledge of the extent of drainage and drainage depth and an adequate routing scheme to simulate the lateral transport. Most often drainage is followed by a land‐cover conversion, which is expected to cause the main biogeochemical and biophysical effects. This land‐cover conversion will need to be prescribed unless its socioeconomic drivers are sufficiently understood. The validation of drainage would thus require to separate between the effects of drainage and the subsequent land‐cover change. We could not identify datasets which at present would support such a validation.
