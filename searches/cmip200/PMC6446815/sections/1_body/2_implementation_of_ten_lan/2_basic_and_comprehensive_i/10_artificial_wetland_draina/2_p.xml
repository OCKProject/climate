<p class="p">Wetlands cover about 4% of the land surface but store about one‐third of the soil organic carbon, mainly in peatlands (Aselmann &amp; Crutzen, 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1989</xref>). Even in the absence of a representation of peatlands, a basic implementation of drainage is feasible in models including a multilayer hydrology by removing water from the lower soil layers and adding it to the run‐off (in addition to the gravitational drainage commonly represented in ESMs). We are not aware of ESMs that implemented wetland drainage.
