<p class="p">A comprehensive implementation would include the representation of mixed‐species stands. Representing species interactions in mixed stands involves competition for light, water and nutrients (see Pretzsch, Forrester, &amp; Rötzer, 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0088" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref> for a review of model approaches). Belowground competition can be captured when the model includes multilayer soil carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and hydrology schemes. Capturing light competition, however, would require the replacement of the current “big leaf” approach of most ESMs by a vertically explicit canopy structure with a multilayer radiation scheme (Haverd et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>; McGrath et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0072" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). The combination of a multilayer radiation and energy scheme enables simulating emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds (Sindelarova et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0109" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Both basic and comprehensive implementations require tree species distribution, whereas the comprehensive implementation also requires the distribution of mixed stands. The evaluation approach can be similar to the one for forestry harvest (see Section 3.1.1).
