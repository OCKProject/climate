<p class="p">The tendency of foresters to select economically interesting species can be captured by adding species‐specific plant functional types (PFTs) to the existing PFTs representing unmanaged forests in ESMs. Besides species‐specific parameter sets, this approach does not require any additional model changes. Tree‐species‐specific parameter sets should include parameters related to carbon allocation, nitrogen cycling, photosynthesis, surface albedo, phenology, and evapotranspiration (Farley, Jobbágy, &amp; Jackson,

 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). Depending on the forestry harvest scheme, parameters related to wood harvest, for example, harvest age or size, should also be included. Species‐specific parameters regarding disease, pest and drought resistance (e.g., mortality) could help to capture carbon releases due to forest dieback. If short rotation coppice is a management strategy a specific PFT could be dedicated to the species that are usually used in these plantations. The species‐specific parameterization will affect all processes that are implemented at the PFT level. If the model has a multilayer soil carbon and hydrology scheme (see Section 3.1.7), species‐specific root profiles will help to capture species differences in water and nutrient uptake. For the main European tree species parameter sets have already been derived and applied (Hickler et al.,
