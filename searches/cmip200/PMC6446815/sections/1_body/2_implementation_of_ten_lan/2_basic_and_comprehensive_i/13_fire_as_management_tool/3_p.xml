<p class="p">A comprehensive implementation accounting for both the biophysical and the biogeochemical effects of fire management (including potentially emissions relevant to wider atmospheric composition interactions such as biomass burning aerosols, methane and carbon monoxide) requires that the vegetation structure is accounted for (Randerson et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0092" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>). Where fire management is applied in woodland savannas, this may require structural model developments that enable mixed PFTs (see implementation of mixed stands in Section 3.1.2), such that trees and grasses compete for the same water, nutrient, and light resources (Saito et al.,

 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0102" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>; Simioni, Le Roux, Gignoux, &amp; Sinoquet, 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0108" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>). In forests, the vegetation structure needs to represent a canopy structure. Preventive fires will then remove part of the litter and the fuel ladders that connect the litter layer with the top canopy through the crowns of the small trees (Scherer, DAmato, Kern, Palik, &amp; Russell, 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0103" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). The chemical composition and dimensions of the biomass as well as the fire characteristics can be used to adjust the emission factors of the burn gases in terms of their carbon and nitrogen compounds (Lobert et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0067" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1990</xref>; Surawski, Sullivan, Meyer, Roxburgh, &amp; Polglase, 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0115" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>; Urbanski, 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0125" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Both the basic and comprehensive approaches require a spatially explicit driver that prescribes the areas where fire is used as a management tool in agriculture and forestry.
