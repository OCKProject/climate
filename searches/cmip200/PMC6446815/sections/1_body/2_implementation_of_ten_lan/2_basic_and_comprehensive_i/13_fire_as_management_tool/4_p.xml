<p class="p">The implementation of fire suppression builds on the functionality required to simulate wildfires (Arora &amp; Boer,

When a wildfire is ignited and the resources for fire suppression are available, a fire suppression module should stop the fire before the natural conditions for burning would stop the fire. A fire suppression module could thus be driven by regional data on the capacity to fight fires as well as the size of the fire, the population density and the property value in the vicinity of the fire to set decisions rules on where to fight wildfires.
