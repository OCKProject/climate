<p class="p">Fire has multiple uses in agriculture, for example, to burn crop residues or manage grazing lands. In inhabited fire‐prone areas, prescribed burning is used to prevent wildfires and if these preventive measures fail, fire suppression is expected to avoid losses. In a basic biogeochemistry‐oriented implementation, a fraction of the litter and standing biomass—after harvest—should be put back into the atmosphere as burn gases (Van der Werf et al.,
