<p class="p">A process‐based representation of tillage effects requires representing vertical layers of soil, with the top layers exchanging carbon and water due to tillage, which leads to different conditions for decomposition. Therefore, the representation of tillage would benefit from a microbial‐based decomposition instead of the first‐order decomposition that is generally used in ESMs but lacks microbial control (Todd‐Brown, Hopkins, Kivlin, Talbot, &amp; Allison,

 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0133" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). While many LSMs represent vertical soil layers for water (e.g., De Rosnay, Polcher, Bruen, &amp; Laval,

 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0081" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>), layered soil carbon schemes (e.g., Braakhekke et al.,

 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>) are less commonly applied. The top‐soil mixing allows for representing altered soil respiration fluxes and, depending on the capabilities of the model's soil scheme, other greenhouse‐gas emissions. Altered soil moisture further influences plant growth, surface water fluxes, and soil albedo. Effects of stubble on albedo can partly be captured by distinguishing between transfer of on‐site residues to soil/litter pools in the case of tillage (see description of crop harvest and residue management) and onsite residues left in the biomass pools for no‐till, or be parameterized, as can be effects of mulch on evaporation (Davin et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). This more comprehensive implementation, however, requires additional input concerning depth of tillage and possibly seasonal timing. Observational data on soil moisture and albedo for till vs. no‐till locations can be used for evaluation (e.g., Davin et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) in addition to carbon stock chronosequences or paired sites.
