<p class="p">A comprehensive implementation of irrigation would also account for paddy rice. Paddy rice has different drivers and effects from irrigation of other crops. The aim is not alleviation of water stress but weed and pest control. The primary impact is via methane emissions. Surface biophysics are also altered in terms of evaporative ability and albedo. To capture emissions of other greenhouse gases, which are particularly important for paddy rice (Wassmann et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0129" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>), models should include methane production as well as an N cycle which can adapt to anaerobic conditions through reduced decomposition and enhanced denitrification (Kraus et al.,
