<p class="p">If mass balance closure is aimed for, which is required for assessments of water availability, the water used for irrigation should, depending on the location, be taken from the simulated aquifers or surface water stocks such as reservoirs and rivers (Gleeson, Wada, Bierkens, &amp; van Beek, 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>; Postel, Daily, &amp; Ehrlich, 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0086" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1996</xref>). This approach is more data‐demanding as the simulated water stocks will need to be evaluated against ground‐truth data. Spatially explicit data on the land area equipped for irrigation and fraction of water need fulfilled should be complemented by data on soil depth to simulate the groundwater table as well as data on sources of extraction. In addition to the evaluation data discussed for the basic approach, this scheme could also be evaluated against statistics of river flow (e.g., Monk, Wood, Hannah, &amp; Wilson, 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0073" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>), soil water content (Entekhabi et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>; Tapley, Bettadpur, Ries, Thompson, &amp; Watkins, 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0116" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>), and amount of water extracted for irrigation (Gleeson et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>; Postel et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0086" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1996</xref>). Note that we propose to use the amount of extracted water for evaluation rather than for driving the model. This proposition is justified by the fact that changes in aquifers are calculated from irrigation statistics. If irrigation statistics are prescribed, the simulated changes in aquifers can no longer be used to evaluate this aspect of model performance. A consequence of this proposition is that irrigation demand will need to be calculated by considering plant physiology in combination with the atmospheric condition.
