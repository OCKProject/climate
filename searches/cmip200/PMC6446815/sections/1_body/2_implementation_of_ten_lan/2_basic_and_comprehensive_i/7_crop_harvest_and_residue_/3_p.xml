<p class="p">More comprehensive implementations will put emphasis on plausible harvest dates by fixing them to statistical information or crop calendars or, in regions with seasonal climate, by interactively simulating harvest dates in dependence on phenological state or climate conditions (e.g., Bondeau et al.,

 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0081" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Removal of nutrients is simulated together with carbon, which requires particular attention to the magnitude and fate of residues, which return part of the nutrients to the system (Kumar &amp; Goh,
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1999</xref>). The outlined approach requires structural changes to the phenology scheme to account for a harvest date, and nutrient cycles. Residual material goes to the litter pools, which generally exist in models; introduction of product pools would allow for accounting for noninstantaneous emissions, for example, due to storage of bioenergy. Effects are changes to carbon and nutrient cycles as well as a more realistic depiction of phenological consequences. Additional input data are needed on fate of harvest and residues and its return to the field as organic amendments. Additional opportunity for evaluation results from the interactive simulation of harvest dates (Sacks, Deryng, Foley, &amp; Ramankutty,
