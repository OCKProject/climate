<p class="p">Reflecting crops’ purpose of providing food, feed, and fiber, the most basic implementation just represents a removal of a fixed fraction of biomass at a fixed date (Lindeskog et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>; Shevliakova et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0105" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>) or an interception of a fixed fraction of productivity or litter (Olofsson &amp; Hickler, 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0082" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). Removed carbon can be released to the atmosphere under the assumption that consumption of harvested products occurs within short time periods or be transferred to short‐lived soil/litter pools (Oleson et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0081" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>; Reick, Raddatz, Brovkin, &amp; Gayler, 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0094" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>), such that product pools are dispensable. Consequences of crop harvest are a reduction in vegetation biomass and consequently soil carbon stocks, associated with emissions of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> to the atmosphere, and biogeophysical changes that are associated with altered vegetation cover. The only required input is information on the amount of biomass that is removed, in absolute terms or relative to standing biomass, although globally fixed rates of removal or biomass left on site are found in model studies (Malyshev, Shevliakova, Stouffer, &amp; Pacala, 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0070" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>; Stocker, Strassmann, &amp; Joos, 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0114" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). Evaluation of such removal can be done via yield data (e.g., Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>) after translating yield dry mass into carbon stocks, and soil carbon chronosequences or paired‐site studies (e.g., Don, Schumacher, &amp; Freibauer, 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>; Poeplau et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0084" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>).
