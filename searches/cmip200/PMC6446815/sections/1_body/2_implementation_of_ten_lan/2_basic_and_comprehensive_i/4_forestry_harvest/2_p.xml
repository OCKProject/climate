<p class="p">Wood harvest is a major process controlling carbon stocks and physical structure of managed forests. A basic representation of wood harvest in ESMs could simply remove a prescribed amount of carbon each year (e.g., Shevliakova et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0105" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). This could be implemented as a mass removal of carbon from the biomass pool or by a removal of a fraction of biomass in the forest area according to harvested area. In the simplest schemes there may be no biophysical impact, although in some models carbon stocks are linked to structure via, for example, canopy height or leaf area and so some biophysical effects may be included. The main effect, though, of a simple scheme is the loss of biomass from the forest. This may be released straight to the atmosphere or stored for some period in a product pool or pools. In order to drive the simple scheme, wood harvest amounts are required (as either mass or area harvested). Slightly more complex schemes may also treat the fate of harvest residue as input to litter or soil carbon pools. The scheme could be evaluated using remote‐sensing‐based biomass products or land‐based forest inventories (Roman‐Cuesta et al.,
