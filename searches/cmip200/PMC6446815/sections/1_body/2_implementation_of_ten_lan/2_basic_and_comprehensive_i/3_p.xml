<p class="p">Since the representation of a land management practice in a model can vary substantially in its level of comprehensiveness, we describe possible approaches on two levels: A “basic” implementation aims at capturing some of the most obvious effects of a practice (e.g., biomass removal for forest harvest), i.e., fulfills the minimum requirement for a model to account for this practice. A more “comprehensive” implementation accounts for details of how the practice is realized (e.g., harvesting of differently aged forest and influencing canopy structure). The aim of the latter is a comprehensive depiction of effects on the Earth system, although some of these effects are marginal (Erb, Luyssaert, et al.,
