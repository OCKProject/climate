<p class="p">A more comprehensive implementation accounts for the return of carbon and nutrients in manure and urine, which is important on grazed lands, with consequences on methane and nitrous oxide emissions (Davidson,

 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0120" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>) and on plant productivity by accelerated nutrient cycling (e.g., McNaughton, Banyikwa, &amp; McNaughton, 1997). While methane emissions from manure are commonly quantified as fraction of enteric methane production (Thornton &amp; Herrero, 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0120" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>), the simulation of nutrient effects on soil respiration, plant growth, and nitrogen‚Äêrelated emissions requires a representation of the nitrogen cycle. Information on which systems are grazed vs. mowed is needed to determine manure input, but does not exist yet. Simulating changes in ecosystem structure due to selective grazing such as woody encroachment in semiarid regions, which affects both biogeochemical and biophysical pathways, requires a complex competition scheme.
