<p class="p">While biophysical effects are found to be relatively weak, strong biogeochemical effects relate to this practice, in particular due to the direct effect of carbon removal (Erb, Luyssaert, et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). The basic implementation and evaluation of effects on carbon stocks are analogous to removal of cropland biomass for crop harvest (e.g., Bondeau et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>; Lindeskog et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>; Shevliakova et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0105" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>), requiring information on grazing intensity in terms of amount of biomass or fraction of net primary production (NPP) removed. Effects are limited to those related to altered carbon stocks. Yet, in reality grazing occurs also on shrubby and woody vegetation (affecting low and high vegetation cover, the latter denoted “browsing”), so that additional information is needed on type of vegetation to be grazed (ecosystem type and the share of low and high vegetation affected) to overcome the current common ESM assumption that all land used for grazing is grassland. Such data are scarcely available, adding to the existing uncertainties (Fetzel et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). An important additional effect of grazing and mowing harvest is the emission of methane from livestock, which accounts for about 2/3 of total non‐CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> greenhouse‐gas emissions from the livestock sector (Herrero et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Methane emissions can be simulated by models of different complexity linking feed intake to fermentation products (Chang et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>; Thornton &amp; Herrero, 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0120" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>) combined with estimates of number of livestock (FAOSTAT, 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>), but the lack of information on dietary composition in ESMs suggests to approximate this by external input on spatially varying fractions of methane emissions per unit biomass removal.
