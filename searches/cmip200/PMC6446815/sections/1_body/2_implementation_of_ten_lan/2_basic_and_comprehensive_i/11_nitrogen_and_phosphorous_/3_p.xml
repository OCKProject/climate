<p class="p">In the comprehensive implementation N concentration in plant and soil are simulated dynamically, and therefore carbon fluxes respond to the N status (Xu‐Ri &amp; Prentice,

 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0135" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). In this approach, N uptake can be determined according to Michaelis–Menten kinetics, proportional to fine root biomass or surface area, N availability, and plant N status. Additional model developments could include N‐dependent allocation (shift toward belowground carbon to improve N status, Smith et al.,

 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). The comprehensive implementation should also capture potential biophysical effects of N fertilization through increased leaf area.
