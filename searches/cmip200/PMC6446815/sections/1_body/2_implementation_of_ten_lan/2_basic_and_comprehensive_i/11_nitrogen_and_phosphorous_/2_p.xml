<p class="p">The biogeochemical effect of N fertilization is large and well‐documented (Erb, Luyssaert, et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>), explaining our suggestion to implement the key N cycling processes in both basic and complex approaches. N cycle processes not related to land management, i.e., representation of N inputs from atmospheric deposition and biological fixation, and ecosystem losses through leaching and microbial emissions, need to be extended to account for input from fertilizer application. In a basic representation, N uptake can be a function of demand and availability, where the demand is determined by assuming a fixed C/N ratio in plant and soil compartments, i.e., if the amount of carbon in the pool increases, N increases accordingly (Goll et al.,

 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0121" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). In this approach, N limitation is relaxed and biomass production increased as a result of N fertilization, but plants are not allowed to optimize their C/N ratio (Haxeltine &amp; Prentice, 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1996</xref>), possibly leading to an overestimation of N limitation. In the basic approach microbial N emissions consist of nitrification and denitrification which can be a function of mineral nitrogen concentration, soil moisture, temperature, pH, and carbon availability (Butterbach‐Bahl, Baggs, Dannenmann, Kiese, &amp; Zechmeister‐Boltenstern,
