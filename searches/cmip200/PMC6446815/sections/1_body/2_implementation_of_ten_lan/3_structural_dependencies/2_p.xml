<p class="p">The implementation of land management practices might require that new structures and processes are added to the model architecture. In FigureÂ 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> we collect the new structures and processes required for the implementation described in Section 3.1 (in parentheses the total number for basic/comprehensive implementation approaches). The degree of these required changes differs largely between land management practices. For example, tree species selection requires a small, and wetland drainage and fire management a large number of new processes and structures to be implemented.
