<p class="p">The required changes introduce dependencies between the land management practices when they are implemented in a comprehensive way, as many processes and structures form basis for more than one practice. Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> shows the interrelation between processes and structures required for the implementation of our ten land management practices. Some structures emerge as being essential in that they form basis for many practices, such as the nitrogen cycle for a more comprehensive implementation, while others are specific to individual practices, such as age structure (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). Note that the most essential structures of a comprehensive implementation include the nitrogen cycle, canopy structure, mixed‐species stands, and representations of methane, most of which go far beyond an extension of existing structures. Considerations of prioritization thus may not just include the number and complexity of processes and structures required by individual land management practices, but also synergies that practices provide in sharing key structures with other practices. For example, all new structures required for tree species selection would already be available following an implementation of fire management or forestry harvest plus crop species selection; similarly irrigation and paddy rice could use the structures provided by implementation of wetland drainage.
