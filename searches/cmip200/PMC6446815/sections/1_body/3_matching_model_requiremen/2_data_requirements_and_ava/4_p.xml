<p class="p">We assess the availability of observational datasets as input variables or parameters as required by the implementation outlined in Section 3.1. It should be noted that few of these datasets are direct observations—many are processed data products relying on additional assumptions, including partly even process‐based modeling (see Text 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-sup-0004" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S2</xref>). Our assessment of data availability aims at simulations for the historical time period (e.g., for simulations covering the industrial era) and includes aspects of data quality and spatial and temporal coverage (Table

 <xref rid="gcb13988-sup-0004" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S2</xref>). Our assessment reveals that data availability differs vastly across the ten land management practices. Good data availability exists for cropland management practices where mostly area information is required (as for basic implementations of crop species selection, fertilization, tillage). Poor data availability is found for forestry harvest, grazing and mowing harvest, artificial wetland drainage, and tillage when the comprehensive assessment requires additional data streams. Partly this may be attributable to complications in separating natural from managed processes in Earth observations.
