<p class="p">Timescales of decades to centuries imply that deriving information on the input variables from Earth observation is often not sufficient—it needs to be possible to reconstruct the same variable from statistical or inventory data to capture time periods prior to the satellite era (e.g., statistics on agricultural area by the Food and Agricultural Organization, statistics on wood production by FAO's Global Forest Resources Assessments, forest inventories). Furthermore, ESMs are frequently used to project anthropogenic effects, including land‐use change, into the future (e.g., Brovkin et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>); the same variable thus needs to be available, from global land system or integrated assessment modeling, for future scenarios. For some land‐use conversions and certain land management practices a harmonization of historical, Earth observation, and IAM data has been performed for CMIP5 (Hurtt et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>) and is currently extended for CMIP6, but covers only a subset of the variables identified as essential input in Section 3.1. Discrepancies between priorities of IAMs and ESMs may therefore limit ESM applications for future management.
