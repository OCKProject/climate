<p class="p">Each land management practice comes with certain additional variables that need to be prescribed from external data (summarized from Section 3.1 in Table 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-sup-0002" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S2</xref>). Most information is required globally and in a spatially explicit way and describes in particular the extent and intensity of the practices, but implementing crop and tree species selection would also require extending the existing parameter sets. Land management has substantially changed over history, and modeling land‐use change effects involves simulations covering a decadal to centennial timescale to capture in particular delayed biogeochemical fluxes and slow feedback responses in the Earth system. Therefore, input datasets need to cover these timescales. Yet, observational data are useful for model evaluation even when available only for certain regions or time periods.
