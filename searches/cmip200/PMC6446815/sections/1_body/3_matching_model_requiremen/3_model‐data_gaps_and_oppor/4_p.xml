<p class="p">Our prioritization results are partly reflected in model development: Coincidence of importance, modeling ease, and data availability for a basic implementation of crop harvest and residue management, which only relies on removal of biomass, indeed is one of the most common land management features in the current generation of models (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). That most models move toward the inclusion of the nitrogen cycle (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>) coincides with nitrogen fertilization being recognized as important and, despite its own complexity, requiring only nutrient‐related structures (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). Grazing and mowing harvest, which requires many additional structures and processes, is left only to the third generation of ESMs, requiring future progress on data availability. A good observational basis may also have been a driver of past model development. For example, the availability of large databases such as from the eddy covariance network Fluxnet (Baldocchi et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>) or the global plant trait database (Kattge et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>) pushed the carbon cycle development in LSMs; the wide inclusion of wood harvest (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>) occurred as part of the development for CMIP5, which provided gridded wood harvest information (Hurtt et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). On the other hand, new scientific questions in the ESM community fostered specific development of datasets, such as the first global reconstructions of some historical land‐use and land‐cover conversions (Kaplan, Krumhardt, &amp; Zimmermann,
