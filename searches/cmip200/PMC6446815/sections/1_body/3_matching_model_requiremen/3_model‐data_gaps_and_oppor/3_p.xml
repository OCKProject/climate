   <p class="p">“Low‐hanging fruits” for modeling a land management practice, where all three aspects are well covered, emerge for a basic implementation approach. Crop harvest and residue management, nitrogen fertilization, and (with some more restrictions on data availability but larger spatial extent) forestry harvest are all important for the Earth system, possible to implement in current ESMs, and provide good data availability (Figure 
    <xref rid="gcb13988-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>a). However, for all three practices the ease of implementation and data availability dramatically drop for a comprehensive implementation (Figure 
    <xref rid="gcb13988-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>b).

   <p class="p">For some land management practices data availability and robustness is the key obstacle for simulating their effects in ESMs. Most notably, data availability is poor for grazing and mowing harvest, which is important for the Earth system and rather easy to implement in current ESMs. Here, a substantial number of variables needs to be provided with external data and quality of the individual datasets is poor (Figure 
    <xref rid="gcb13988-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>a and Text 
    <xref rid="gcb13988-sup-0004" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S2</xref>). The problem arises both for the basic and comprehensive implementation, interfering with modeling groups’ plans of moving toward representation of grazing processes in their models (Figure 
    <xref rid="gcb13988-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Data availability is poor also for artificial wetland drainage and fire as management tool, but implementation for these practices is equally hindered by the lack of process understanding. Data availability becomes the limiting factor for many land management practices for a comprehensive implementation (Figure 
    <xref rid="gcb13988-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>b).

   <p class="p">A call for more research on process understanding was voiced by Erb, Luyssaert, et al. (
    <xref rid="gcb13988-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>) for crop species selection, tillage, artificial wetland drainage, and fire as management tool. Our analysis shows that for the first two, process understanding is indeed the major obstacle, as the available structures of current ESMs are capable of catching the basic effects of crop species selection and tillage and data availability is good. Simulation of the latter two is also hindered by data availability.
