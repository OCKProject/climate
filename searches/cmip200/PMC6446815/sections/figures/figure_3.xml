The completeness score reflects how many of forest management and agricultural management processes and variables are considered in the models. For forest management the maximum score of four reflects that (1) wood harvest, (2) forest age classes, (3) the fate of harvest, and (4) the fate of residues are considered. For agricultural management the maximum score of nine would include (1) cropland presentation, (2) crop harvest, (3) fate of harvest, (4) crop residues, (5) fertilizer use, (6) use of irrigation, (7) inclusion of other greenhouse gases, (8) grazing, and (9) pasture management. A score of zero means that none of them are included
