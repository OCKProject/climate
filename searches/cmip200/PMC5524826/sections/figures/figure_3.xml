  <p class="p">Reservoir water storage anomalies considering future climate and projected demand in 2020–2035 relative to the baseline (1995–2010). Each gray line is a model output driven by one single climate model. A net positive ensemble average (blue) indicates that on average the future storage will be more than the baseline, whereas a negative storage (red) indicates that the system will expect more water stress relative to the baseline (i.e., Millennium Drought) – for demand scenarios see Table
