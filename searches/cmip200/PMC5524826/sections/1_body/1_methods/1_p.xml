CMIP5 includes a suite of historical and future climate simulations that are subjected to common GHG emissions or concentration scenarios, as reported in the fifth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2013). We chose CMIP5 simulations of the RCP 8.5 scenario of exponentially growing 21

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref> in Supplementary Materials) supplied a wide range of hypothetical water demand scenarios, from very low stress to very high stress. These data are estimated from different projections of population growth, industrial and agricultural development, and consumption behavior. The observed inflow and outflow to Melbourne major reservoirs (Maroondah, O’Shannassy, Upper Yarra, and Thomson) are from Melbourne Water, and are used for model calibration.
