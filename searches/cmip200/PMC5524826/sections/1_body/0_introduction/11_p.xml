<p id="Par12" class="p">The framework presented in the Methods Section offers time series of change in storage based on the future climate and water demand scenarios. For selected water demand discussed in Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> displays time series of reservoir storage anomalies (%). The gray lines represent future projections of different climate models relative to the baseline, whereas the red and blue lines denote the ensemble means. The ensemble means that lead to an overall positive or negative anomaly are shown in blue, and red, respectively. In the ensemble means marked by blue, storage anomalies in the reservoirs remain positive during the projection period relative to the baseline period. Yet, for most other demand scenarios the ensemble means are negative (red lines) and the storage of the reservoirs would be below the historical baseline level. It is worth mentioning that uncertainties in the future model projections and demand scenarios are substantial (see Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>) and the variability should be considered along with the mean behavior of the system. We also acknowledge that accounting for climate change impacts on water supply (e.g., input to reservoirs) does not fully capture the spread or uncertainty in the water storage scenarios.
