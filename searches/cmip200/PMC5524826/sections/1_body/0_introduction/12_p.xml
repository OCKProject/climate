<p id="Par13" class="p">This modeling framework aims to show whether the current reservoirs provide sufficient local resilience against the projected climatic change and increase in water demand. In scenarios that lead to negative storage anomalies, the available storage capacity may not be sufficient to buffer against future climate change and water demand increases

 </sup>. The proposed modeling framework allows managers to assess climate change impact on water resources while including water supply infrastructure such as desalination plants. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> shows to what extent a high reliability alternative water source of 150 GL per year can buffer water shortages in a changing climate and expected future demand scenarios. For all combinations of the climate model simulations for the future (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>) and projected water demand (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>), Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> shows the storage deficit with and without the addition of alternative water sources of 150 GL per year. The addition of a high reliability alternative water source reduces the storage deficit substantially (compare Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4a and b</xref>). However, under some combinations of future water demand and projected climate change (RCP 8.5), the region will likely experience water stress conditions more extreme than the Millennium drought, despite the available water storage and supply infrastructure.
