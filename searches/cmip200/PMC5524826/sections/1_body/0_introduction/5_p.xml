<p id="Par6" class="p">While previous studies have addressed integrating human interactions in earth system or hydrologic models, there are still major modeling challenges. Previous studies do not include local reservoir model calibration based on water storage information, which is closely associated with local resilience to extreme events. Furthermore, global water demand projections used for assessing human influence do not include local policies and management practices. This paper outlines a nested modeling framework that explicitly accounts for future water demand and man-made infrastructure such as reservoirs and high reliability alternative water sources (local resilience) when evaluating the impact of climate change on water resources (see Methods Section). The model is designed to reproduce historical observations and allows for integrating multiple types of infrastructure (e.g., reservoirs and other high reliability alternative water sources). The proposed nested framework allows tailoring the model to local conditions and including bottom-up information such as future demand scenarios. In this study, human water demand provided local information based on different population and growth policies.</p>
