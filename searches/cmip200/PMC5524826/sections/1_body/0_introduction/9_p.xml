<p id="Par10" class="p">Considering only the future climate and ignoring both future demand and storage capacity leads to a different perspective on future water availability (Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref> in Supplementary Materials). Model simulations of the future indicate that under RCP 8.5, the region will experience significant reduction in runoff during 2020–2035 relative to 1995–2010, and the ensemble mean of all future inflow simulations is negative (i.e., indicates more water stress in the future relative to the baseline). The inflow, alone, is not a good indicator of water availability since: (a) it does not include the amount of water needed for human consumption; or (b) how much of the inflow can be stored in reservoirs or augmented by other infrastructure. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> offers a unique perspective that involves both of these issues in future water availability assessment (compare Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> with Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>). In fact, we argue that without accounting for water storage and human water needs, estimates of future water availability (or stress) may not be reliable.
