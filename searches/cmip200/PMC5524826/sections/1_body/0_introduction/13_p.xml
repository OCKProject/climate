<p id="Par14" class="p">In recent years, assessing future changes in water availability has received a great deal of attention. Increased human water use, which will likely increase in the future, is recognized as an important component of local water stress

 </sup>. Our results suggest that predictions of future water availability should consider not only the future climate, but also future localized water demand and water supply infrastructure to cope with climate variability. In fact, climate alone is not a very good predictor of future water scarcity, because of the many complex ways in which humans acquire and use water. Here, we present a case that isolates the interaction between just three components (projected climate change, projected human water demand, and local storage) of this much more complex system. Indeed, for the same set of climate scenarios, existing water supply infrastructure is either adequate or not depending on projections of water demand. The interaction between human and climate can dramatically enhance or reduce local vulnerability to water stress. A question often ignored in the climate community is: To what extent will uncontrolled growth with concomitant increase in water use exacerbate future water stress? Our framework offers a unique way to incorporate the anthropogenic water demand (human-induced water stress) and local capacity to cope with extremes when assessing future climate. This approach can be used to assess unexpected consequences that can occur when both demand and climate vary within normal bands, but their combination leads occasionally to acute water scarcity.
