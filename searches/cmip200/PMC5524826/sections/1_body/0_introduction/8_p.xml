<p id="Par9" class="p">Melbourne’s future water availability, considering the available storage infrastructure, projected climate, and all expected future demand scenarios (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>) are summarized in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>. The purple-shaded region (far left) shows optimistic future water demand scenarios in which the demand in the projection period (2020–2035) is less than the baseline (1995–2010). These scenarios lead to more mean water storage in the projection period relative to the baseline (i.e., positive mean storage anomalies or more available water relative to the baseline). The green-shaded region shows scenarios in which future demand is greater than the baseline, but the projected average storage anomalies still remain positive. That is, despite increases in the future demand, the system would not experience water stress worse than that of the baseline period (which includes the Millennium Drought). The red-shaded region corresponds to scenarios in which future demand significantly exceeds that of the baseline, and projected average storage anomalies are negative under the RCP8.5 climate projections. This latter indicates that the Melbourne area would experience more water stress in the future relative to the baseline period, given the current storage capacity and considering both climatic change and future demand.
