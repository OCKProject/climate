<p id="Par11" class="p">While 14 scenarios project higher water demands in the future relative to that of the baseline period, only 9 of those scenarios (Very Low Stress to Very High Stress in Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>) lead to storage deficit more extreme than the baseline period under the RCP8.5 climate change assumption (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Note that the baseline period includes the Millennium drought. These results suggest that the combination of climatic change and several projected water demand scenarios (including the ensemble mean of the selected climate models and demand scenarios) would likely lead to water stress conditions more extreme than the Millennium drought. Furthermore, with the available storage infrastructure, if the demand is restricted to the low or medium demand scenarios (blue and green regions in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>), the net average storage remains above the baseline period. Comparing low (blue) and high (red) water demand scenarios in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> highlights that human-induced water stress significantly exacerbates climate impacts on water availability. While human water use can cause or intensify water stress, if managed well, it allows societies to react and adapt to the projected conditions (blue and green regions in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>).
