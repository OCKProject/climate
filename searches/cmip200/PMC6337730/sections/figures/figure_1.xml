 <caption class="caption">
  <p class="p">Schematic flow chart depicting the processing of climate projections and EU-forest inventory data to eventually obtain projected species distribution maps (here using the grid cell corresponding with the location of Munich and Scots pine projected for current climate conditions as an example). 
   <bold class="bold">(A)</bold> For each of the 3,949 grid cells current and future analogs are computed resulting in 3,949 different climate analog regions. 
   <bold class="bold">(B)</bold> For each species, relative abundance per grid cell is computed, resulting in 26 species-specific relative abundance maps. 
   <bold class="bold">(C)</bold> Intersection of the current/future climate analog region with the species-specific relative abundance map allows for computing the mean relative abundance of a given species within the corresponding climate analog region which is taken as local relative abundance probability of the corresponding grid cell. 
   <bold class="bold">(D)</bold> Computing local relative abundance probabilities for each of the 3,949 grid cells allows for projecting the relative abundance probability of a specific species under a certain scenario across Europe. Please note the comparably good match between actual Scots pine relative abundance 
   <bold class="bold">(B)</bold> and projected current Scots pine relative abundance probability 
   <bold class="bold">(D)</bold>.
