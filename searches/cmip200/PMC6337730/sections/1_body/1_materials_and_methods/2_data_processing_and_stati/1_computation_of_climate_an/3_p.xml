<p class="p">To define current/future climate analogs, we then computed the Manhattan distance (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Black, 2006</xref>) between the standardized current/future climate variables of a given site and the historic climate variables of all considered grid cells. Consequently, each of the considered grid cells obtained a value which resembled the climatic distance (considering all 11 variables) of that grid cell to the selected site and projection. That is, the lower this climatic distance, the more similar the climate of the respective grid cell to the projected current/future climate of the selected site.
