<p class="p">To map recent and potential future species distributions we computed climate analogs and merged those with the EU-forest dataset (see Section “Mapping Current and Future Tree-Species Distributions”). Here, we used climate analogs to identify regions which currently feature climate conditions that are more or less similar to the projected conditions of a given site. Depending on the selected target projection we in the following call these climates 
 <italic class="italic">current</italic> analogs if considering current climates that are analogous to the current climate of a given site vs. 
 <italic class="italic">future</italic> analogs if considering current climates that are analogous to the projected future climate of a given site.
