<p class="p">To visualize the change of European forests tree species composition (see Section “Mapping Current and Future Tree-Species Distributions”) we first of all plotted current and future relative abundance probabilities for the four currently most abundant European tree species, i.e., 
 <italic class="italic">P. sylvestris</italic> (Scots pine), 
 <italic class="italic">P. abies</italic> (Norway spruce), 
 <italic class="italic">F. sylvatica</italic> (European beech), and 
 <italic class="italic">Q. robur</italic> (English oak). In combination, these four species make up 44% of the considered forest inventory data. As a proxy for tree-species relevance for forestry within the different scenarios, we computed the mean relative abundance probability for each species across all grid cells for current and future conditions. That is, species with high mean relative abundance probabilities in a given scenario feature a high relevance for forestry and 
 <italic class="italic">vice versa</italic>. As a measure of change for the general appearance of forests, we moreover computed the relative change of the currently most dominant tree species for each of the 3,949 grid cells. That is, for each grid cell the currently dominant tree species was determined and its relative abundance probability of the two future scenarios for the same grid cell was put in relation to its current relative abundance probability. Finally, as a measure of tree-species diversity changes, we for each grid cell computed Shannon’s H (
