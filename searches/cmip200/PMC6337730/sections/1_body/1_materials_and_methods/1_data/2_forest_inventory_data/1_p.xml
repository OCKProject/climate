<p class="p">As a baseline for current tree species distributions across Europe, we downloaded the recently published EU-Forest dataset (
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Mauri et al., 2017</xref>). This dataset contains altogether 588,983 tree-species records (for details see 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Mauri et al., 2017</xref>). Due to low spatial and climatological representativity we did not consider data from the Canary Islands, finally resulting in 586,862 records representing altogether 242 different tree species distributed across Europe. Since many of these species were only represented at very few locations and thus would not allow for a meaningful representation of their current potential distribution, we decided to only include the 26 species which each at least represented 1% of the total dataset. By doing so, we eventually considered 82% of the EU-Forest dataset for our analyses (for an overview on the selected species see Supplementary Table
