<p class="p">While Scots pine and Norway spruce expressed a decrease in the order of 5 (RCP 4.5) to 15% (RCP 8.5) of mean relative abundance probability across Europe, European beech and English oak retained their mean relative abundance probability for both scenarios (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3</xref>). Despite possible losses in abundance probability, these four tree-species remained the most abundant across Europe. Tree species with remarkable increases (2–6%) of abundance probabilities were

 <italic class="italic">Pinus halepensis</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Pinus nigra</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Castanea sativa</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Quercus pubescens</italic>, all of which seemed to expand their current distributional range from the Mediterranean to Central Europe. In contrast, declining species mostly featured a northward migration of their distributional range rather than an expansion (Figure
