<p class="p">Shannonâ€™s H expressed features complementary to relative abundance changes (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">5</xref> vs. Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">4</xref>). That is, while tree-species diversity decreased in the Mediterranean, it generally increased in Central and Northern Europe, thereby mirroring the immigration of new species into those regions (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">5</xref> upper panels). Under RCP 4.5 74% of grid cells expressed increasing tree-species diversity while it was only 68% under RCP 8.5 (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">5</xref> lower panel). However, under RCP 8.5 the distribution was shifted toward higher increases in tree-species diversity, particularly in Scandinavia.
