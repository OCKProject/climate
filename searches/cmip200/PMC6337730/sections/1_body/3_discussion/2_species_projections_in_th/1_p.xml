<p class="p">The projected changes of the four most abundant species are in line with recent research. First of all, for Scots pine an increasing mortality at its southern distributional margin was observed over the last decades, e.g., on the Iberian peninsula after a severe drought in 2005 (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Galiano et al., 2010</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>), in inner-alpine dry valleys, for instance in 1998 and 2003 (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Rebetez and Dobbertin, 2004</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bigler et al., 2006</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Pichler and Oberhuber, 2007</xref>), and recently also Central European lowlands after the hot and dry summer of 2015 (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Buras et al., 2018</xref>). Secondly, Norway spruce is well-known for its high drought-susceptibility (

 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">LÃ©vesque et al., 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Zang et al., 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Rehschuh et al., 2017</xref>). Since the frequency and intensity of drought spells are projected to increase in Central Europe (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Horton et al., 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Pfleiderer and Coumou, 2018</xref>), the disappearance of Norway spruce from Central European lowlands in our projections seems reasonable. Finally, our projections suggested beech to express a more pronounced decline in Central Europe compared to English oak, although both species were relatively less affected in comparison to Scots pine and Norway spruce. On the one hand, this is in line with 
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Zang et al. (2014)</xref>, who reported a lower drought susceptibility of beech in comparison to Norway spruce. On the other hand, the higher drought susceptibility of beech in comparison to English oak has been reported on the basis of dendro-ecological investigations (
