<p class="p">Considering less abundant species, the projected northward expansion of 
 <italic class="italic">Q. ilex</italic> also finds support in the literature. Based on tree-ring analyses, 
 <italic class="italic">Q. ilex</italic> was shown to decline under increasing water stress, but to benefit from increasing winter temperatures (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gea-Izquierdo et al., 2011</xref>), which is in line with the projected northward expansion and decline in the driest regions in Spain (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" class="xref">S9</xref>). Also, the increasing importance of 
 <italic class="italic">Q. pubescens</italic> in Central European lowlands (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" class="xref">S13</xref>), finds support in the literature. That is, pubescent oak has been reported to potentially replace Scots pine in dry inner-alpine valleys due to a comparably better adaptation to dry conditions (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Eilmann et al., 2009</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Rigling et al., 2013</xref>). The projected northward migration of 
 <italic class="italic">P. nigra</italic> (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" class="xref">S11</xref>) is supported by studies which reported a relatively high drought-susceptibility of black pine and increasing trends in needle defoliation in the Mediterranean which reflects its sensitivity to increasing temperatures (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Linares and TÃ­scar, 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Carnicer et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, its cold-hardiness was reported to be in the range of Central European species which renders it suitable for the projected northward migration (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kreyling et al., 2012</xref>). Also for 
 <italic class="italic">P. pinaster</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. halepensis</italic> an increased leaf defoliation has been observed, indicating a declining performance of those species in the Mediterranean (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Carnicer et al., 2011</xref>) which is also reflected in their projected northward migration in our study (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" class="xref">S10</xref>). In conclusion, several of the presented projected changes of European tree-species distributions are supported by independent studies.
