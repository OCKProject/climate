<p class="p">Another shortcoming of the presented approach is related to the current relative abundance of species. For instance, 
 <italic class="italic">Picea sitchensis</italic> is yet mainly distributed in the United Kingdom and Denmark, which may introduce certain biases regarding its projected distribution. That is, although it also is capable of growing under more continental conditions, the high abundance in the observational data mainly restricts it to coastal climates in the projected relative abundances. This is also the main reason, why we focused our evaluation on the four most abundant tree species. However, to also include species with projected increasing relative abundances, we decided to consider all species which cover at least 1% of the EU-forest data. Another constraint in this context is related to other theoretically important tree species that were not considered in our approach due to a marginal representation in the EU-forest data. For instance, 
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Walentowski et al. (2017)</xref> reported 
 <italic class="italic">Acer campestre</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Sorbus torminalis</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Sorbus aria</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Ulmus minor</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Tilia platyphyllos</italic> to be well adapted to anticipated climate conditions, all of which were not considered here due to low representation. Within this context it moreover is important to mention, that based on the utilized forest-inventory data, we were not able to incorporate tree species from the Mediterranean coast of North Africa, which may qualify as potential alternative tree species for the European Mediterranean under projected climate conditions. Therefore, the decline in tree-species diversity for Mediterranean regions has to be interpreted in the context of the underlying data. That is, the depicted declining tree-species diversity in those regions highlights a substantial loss in diversity regarding Europeâ€™s 26 currently most abundant tree species, and thus that local foresters should consider non-native tree species from outside of Europe as potential alternatives.
