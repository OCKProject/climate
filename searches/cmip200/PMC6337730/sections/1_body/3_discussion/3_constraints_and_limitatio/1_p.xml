<p class="p">Despite the support by independent studies, the methodological approach behind the presented projected tree-species distributions features certain constraints and limitations. Most of all, the rather coarse resolution of 0.5° yet needs further improvement. This is because at such coarse resolution, elevational differences are only poorly resolved—particularly in the inner-alpine valleys but also in other mountain areas such as the Norwegian fjords. Therefore, projected relative abundances of these regions have to be interpreted carefully. For instance, while it seems likely that Norway spruce and Scots pine refugia will remain at higher elevations in the Alps, these species will likely disappear from the dry inner alpine-valleys. To overcome these limitations, future studies should consider integration of higher resolved climate projections such as the EURO-CORDEX ensembles with 11 km spatial resolution (

 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Fick and Hijmans, 2017</xref>). However, since we wanted to account for model uncertainty by incorporating a comparably large number of different simulations and moreover encountered computational limitations, we here opted for downscaled projections derived from 16 different models. But even if increasing the spatial resolution to 1 km, unresolved sub-scale processed would remain. A focal point in the context of sub-scale processes is the forest edge, which recently was shown to feature a higher drought-induced mortality of Scots pine within the first 50 m of forest-edge distance (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Buras et al., 2018</xref>) that may also hold true for other tree species. However, given the specific micro-climatic conditions at the forest edge (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Chen et al., 1993</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1999</xref>), incorporation of these effects into projections of tree-species distributions that rely on gridded climate projections only remains a demanding challenge. Consequently, the forest edge needs to be given further attention in the context of climate-change induced tree vulnerability.
