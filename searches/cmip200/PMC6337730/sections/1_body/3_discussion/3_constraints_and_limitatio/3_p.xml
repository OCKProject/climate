<p class="p">The rigorous definition of the climate analog threshold to the average first percentile over all European grid cells also has certain caveats. Although the validation assessments confirmed this threshold superior in comparison to others, some likely errors resulted as for instance the projected increase in relative abundance of beech and oak on the Kola Peninsula (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2</xref>). One way to cope with this, is to incorporate additional climate parameters into the computation of climate distances. However, in the extensive trials undertaken to identify the best-suited variable combination, we eventually decided for the current selection, which may be considered the best compromise among available variables, particularly since the match between actual and projected current tree-species distributions were fairly good (see Section “Mapping Current and Future Tree-Species Distributions” and Supplementary Figures
