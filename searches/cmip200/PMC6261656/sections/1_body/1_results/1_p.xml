 </xref>). Aggregated over all areas for which observational data are available for the full 1931–2015 period, the probability of a warm year (relative to a given area’s 1961–1990 mean) has increased from ~50% during the mid-20th century to &gt;80% in the 21st century (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1D</xref>). The time evolution of warm year probability in the Historical climate model ensemble closely matches that of the observations, increasing from ~40% in the mid-20th century to ~80% in the early 21st century (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1G</xref>). In contrast, the warm year probability remains centered around 20% (relative to a given area’s 1961–1990 mean) throughout the Natural ensemble, with the 2.5th to 97.5th percentile confidence intervals of the Historical and Natural ensembles remaining completely separated after ~1970. There is thus high statistical confidence that the observed increase in warm year probability would not have occurred without anthropogenic forcing.
