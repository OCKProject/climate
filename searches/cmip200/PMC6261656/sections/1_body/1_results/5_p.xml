<p class="p">Previous work shows that the occurrence of extreme years—and especially extremely warm years—is particularly important for the volatility of agricultural yields and hence prices [e.g., (

  <italic class="italic">5</italic>
 </xref>, 
 <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">22</italic>
 </xref>)]. We therefore analyze the joint probability of progressively larger climate anomalies. Like the co-occurrence of years that are warmer and drier than the historical mean (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>), we find that the joint probability of simultaneous occurrence of these more extreme combinations of temperature and precipitation has also increased during the historical period (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>). For example, the joint probability of a year in which the temperature exceeds 2 standard deviations (SDs) of the baseline variability and the precipitation is drier than the baseline mean has increased from &lt;5% for all region pairs in the 1931–1950 and 1961–1980 periods to &gt;10% for 31% of the region pairs in the 1996–2015 period (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Fig. 3A</xref>). Similarly, the joint probability of a year in which the temperature exceeds 2 SDs of the baseline variability and the precipitation is at least 1 SD drier than the baseline mean has increased from &lt;1% for all region pairs in the 1931–1950 and 1961–1980 periods to &gt;1% for 42% of the region pairs in the 1996–2015 period (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Fig. 3B</xref>). Further, whereas most region pairs exhibit zero probability during the 1931–1950 and 1961–1980 periods that a year exceeds 4 SDs of the baseline temperature variability and is simultaneously drier than the baseline mean, all region pairs exhibit &gt;0% probability during the 1996–2015 period, including &gt;1% probability in 12% of the region pairs (
