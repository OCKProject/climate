<p class="p">In contrast, the probability of dry years has remained ~50% at the global scale throughout the observational period (relative to the 1961â€“1990 baseline; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1E</xref>), with areas of the tropics and subtropics exhibiting increases and much of the extratropics exhibiting decreases or no change (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1B</xref>). Although both the observations and the Historical climate model ensemble exhibit slight indications of a decrease in dry year probability in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, the 2.5th to 97.5th percentile confidence intervals of the Historical and Natural ensembles overlap substantially throughout the historical period (
