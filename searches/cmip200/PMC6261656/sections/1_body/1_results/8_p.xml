<p class="p">The lower forcing in the RCP2.6 scenario substantially curbs the increase in joint probability for the most severe thresholds (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>). For example, the joint probability of a year in which the temperature exceeds 4 SDs of the baseline variability is &gt;20% larger in RCP8.5 than RCP2.6 for 83% of the region pairs and &gt;50% larger in RCP8.5 for 33% of the region pairs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">Fig. 5A</xref>). Four-SD annual temperature anomalies represent extreme conditions and are likely to cause acute impacts even if they do not occur in conjunction with low precipitation. However, in addition to the increases in the probability of co-occurring extremely hot years, the joint probability of a year in which the temperature exceeds 4 SDs and the precipitation is drier than the baseline mean is &gt;20% larger in RCP8.5 for 72% of the region pairs. Likewise, the joint probability of a year in which the temperature exceeds 4 SDs and the precipitation is at least 1 SD drier than the baseline mean is &gt;20% larger in RCP8.5 for 62% of the region pairs.
