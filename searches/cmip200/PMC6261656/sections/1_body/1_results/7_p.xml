<p class="p">Continued greenhouse gas emissions are likely to further increase the joint probabilities of severely warm+dry conditions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>). Relative to the CMIP5 historical simulations, the joint probability of a year in which the temperature simultaneously exceeds 2 SDs of the baseline variability in both regions increases by at least 60 percentage points for all region pairs in the 2020â€“2050 period of Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5), and the joint probability of a year in which the temperature simultaneously exceeds 4 SDs increases by at least 30 percentage points for 90% of the region pairs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Fig. 4A</xref>). As a result, the joint probability of a year in which the temperature exceeds 2 SDs and the precipitation is drier than the baseline mean increases by at least 20 percentage points for 21% of the region pairs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Fig. 4C</xref>). Likewise, the joint probability of a year in which the temperature exceeds 4 SDs and the precipitation is drier than the baseline mean increases by at least 10 percentage points for 44% of the region pairs (
