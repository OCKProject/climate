<p class="p">The increase in global warm+dry probability would be expected to increase the odds that different regions experience warm+dry years simultaneously. Given the negative impacts of co-occurring warm+dry conditions on agricultural yields (

 </xref>) and the importance of co-occurring yield shocks for regional and global agricultural markets [e.g., (

  <italic class="italic">3</italic>
 </xref>â€“
 <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">5</italic>
 </xref>)], we quantify the joint probability of warm+dry conditions in pairs of global crop and pasture regions (see Materials and Methods). We find that these regions have become substantially more likely to experience warm+dry anomalies in the same year over the historical period (
