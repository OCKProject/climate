<p class="p">Despite the spatial heterogeneity of trends in dry year probability (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1B</xref>), the increasing trends in warm year probability (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1A</xref>) lead to broad increases in the probability of years that are both warm and dry (“warm+dry”; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1C</xref>). At the global scale, the aggregated warm+dry probabilities are similar to what would be expected from the product of the two univariate probabilities (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>, D and E), with global warm+dry probability equaling ~20% in the mid-20th century and ~40% in the early 21st century (relative to the 1961–1990 baseline; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1F</xref>). At the regional scale, the largest increases in warm+dry probabilities are generally associated with the largest increases in warm year probabilities, although the lack of data in the tropics likely limits the number of grid points that exhibit increases in both univariate probabilities. The most prominent exception to the general increase in warm+dry probability is the well-documented “warming hole” over the central and southeastern United States, where the warm, dry, and warm+dry probabilities all exhibit decreasing trends over the 1931–2015 period (
