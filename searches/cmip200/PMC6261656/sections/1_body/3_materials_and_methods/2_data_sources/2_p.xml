 </xref>). To match the NOAA observational data, we calculated monthly temperature and precipitation anomalies using the 1961–1990 baseline. Following many previous studies, we accessed all available CMIP5 realizations and interpolated all climate model realizations to a common 1° by 1° geographical grid. For the regional analyses (see below), we used all the 1° by 1° grid points in each region.
