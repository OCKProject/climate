<p class="p">We analyzed observational temperature and precipitation data from the NOAA Global Historical Climate Network–Monthly gridded products, which are available on a 5° by 5° geographical grid (

 </xref>). We restricted our observational analysis to grid points for which observational data were available for the full 1931–2015 period, with the joint probability analysis restricted to those grid points for which both observational temperature and precipitation data were available. The NOAA temperature and precipitation data were available as monthly anomalies, which we aggregated to annual values. Because the temperature and precipitation data used different baseline periods for calculating the anomalies (1981–2010 for temperature and 1961–1990 for precipitation), we used a simple arithmetic adjustment to express each of the temperature values as an anomaly from the 1961–1990 period (i.e., by adding the difference between the 1981–2010 calendar-month mean and the 1961–1990 calendar-month mean to each monthly temperature value).
