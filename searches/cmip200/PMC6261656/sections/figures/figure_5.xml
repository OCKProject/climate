  <p class="p">Colors show the probability (based on the Bayesian posterior mean) that both regions of a respective region pair experience severe conditions in the same year during the 2020–2050 period of the RCP8.5 simulations, expressed as the percent difference from the probability in the 2020–2050 period of the RCP2.6 simulations.

   <bold class="bold">A</bold>) Joint probability for years in which the temperature anomaly is at least 4 SDs warmer than the baseline mean. (
   <bold class="bold">B</bold>) Joint probability for years in which the temperature anomaly is at least 4 SDs warmer than the baseline mean and the precipitation anomaly is drier than the baseline mean. (
   <bold class="bold">C</bold>) Joint probability for years in which the temperature anomaly is at least 4 SDs warmer than the baseline mean and the precipitation anomaly is at least 1 SD drier than the baseline mean.
