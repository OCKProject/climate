  <title class="title">Historical change in joint probability of simultaneous warm+dry conditions of varying severity.</title>
  <p class="p">Colors show the probability (based on the Bayesian posterior mean) that both regions of a respective region-region pair experience simultaneous warm and dry conditions in the same year during the 1931–1950, 1961–1980, and 1996–2015 periods, based on NOAA observations. (
   <bold class="bold">A</bold>) Joint probability for years in which the temperature anomaly is at least 2 SDs warmer than the baseline mean and the precipitation anomaly is drier than the baseline mean. (
   <bold class="bold">B</bold>) Joint probability for years in which the temperature anomaly is at least 2 SDs warmer than the baseline mean and the precipitation anomaly is at least 1 SD drier than the baseline mean. (
   <bold class="bold">C</bold>) Joint probability for years in which the temperature anomaly is at least 4 SDs warmer than the baseline mean and the precipitation anomaly is drier than the baseline mean. The 
   <italic class="italic">P</italic> value of the difference in joint probability between the CMIP5 Historical and Natural simulations is indicated as in Fig. 2.
