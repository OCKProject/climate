   <bold class="bold">C</bold> to 
   <bold class="bold">E</bold>) Thickness of lines shows the probability (based on the Bayesian posterior mean) that both regions of a respective region-region pair experience simultaneous warm and dry conditions in the same year during the 1931–1950, 1961–1980, and 1996–2015 periods, based on NOAA observations. Each region pair shares a single joint probability. The color of each region-region joint probability is shown as the color of the first region on the circular plot, starting with Canada and moving clockwise around the circular plot. Thus, all region-region joint probabilities involving Canada are shown in red, and all involving US_West are shown in dark gray except for Canada-US_West, etc. The values of the region-region joint probabilities are shown in (F) to (H). (
   <bold class="bold">F</bold> to 
   <bold class="bold">H</bold>) Colors show the probability values depicted by lines in (C) to (E). Symbols show the 
   <italic class="italic">P</italic> value of the difference in joint probability between the CMIP5 Historical and Natural simulations for the 1931–1950, 1961–1980, and 1986–2005 periods (see Materials and Methods). The absence of a symbol indicates 
   <italic class="italic">P</italic> value less than 0.01, a gray circle indicates 
   <italic class="italic">P</italic> value between 0.01 and 0.05, and a black circle indicates 
   <italic class="italic">P</italic> value greater than 0.05.
