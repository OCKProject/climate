<p id="Par8" class="p">Sea ice loss can force a change in the NAM via a tropospheric pathway or through interaction with the stratosphere [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">28</xref>]. The tropospheric pathway is associated with the adjustment of transient eddies to the change in meridional temperature gradient and baroclinic instability. The stratospheric pathway involves enhanced upward planetary-scale wave propagation and the weakening of the stratospheric polar vortex [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">29</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">30</xref>], which then modifies the NAM. Idealised atmospheric general circulation model experiments, using configurations with and without an interactive stratosphere, suggest that when the stratosphere is inactive, the tropospheric jet still shifts equatorward in response to Arctic warming, but by approximately half the magnitude compared to that of an active stratosphere [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>]. The stratospheric pathway appears sensitive to the location of sea ice loss whereas the tropospheric pathway appears less so [
