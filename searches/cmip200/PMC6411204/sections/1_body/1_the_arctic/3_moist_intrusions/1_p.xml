<p id="Par14" class="p">An aspect of Arctic meteorology that has garnered considerable scientific interest in recent years is intrusions of warm and moist air. Intrusions occur predominantly over the ocean basins and typically when a large-scale blocking pattern to the east of each basin deflects midlatitude cyclones and their associated moisture into the Arctic [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" class="xref">54</xref>]. Woods and Caballero (2016) found an increase in the frequency of moist intrusions, which can explain roughly 45% of the surface warming trend and 30% of the sea ice loss in the Barents Sea during the past two decades [
