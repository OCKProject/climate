<p id="Par17" class="p">Rudeva and Simmonds (2015) analysed cyclone behaviour in 34Â years of data and found significant increases in winter cyclone frequency to the north of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago and to the north of Greenland [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" class="xref">58</xref>]. In summer, they revealed a quite different pattern of change, with negative trends north of the Beaufort Sea and positive trends centred over the Laptev Sea. Similar trend results were achieved by Zahn et al. (2018) who used a somewhat shorter period and four reanalyses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" class="xref">59</xref>]. They identified increasing winter cyclone frequency over most of the central Arctic Ocean and towards the Pacific, and decreasing winter cyclone frequency in the Barents Sea and north of the Russian coast. These cyclone frequency changes are consistent with observed winter changes in the frequency and longevity of high-latitude blocking [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" class="xref">60</xref>]. The contrasting regional trends were broadly consistent across the four reanalyses. They showed, however, that the magnitudes of trends differed in strength between reanalyses. When summed over the entire Arctic basin, the number of Arctic cyclones exhibits no significant linear trend in any season [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" class="xref">61</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" class="xref">62</xref>]. Given the opposing regional trends mentioned above, this finding is perhaps not surprising.
