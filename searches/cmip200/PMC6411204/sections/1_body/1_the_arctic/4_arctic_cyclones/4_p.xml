<p id="Par19" class="p">Turning now to future projections of Arctic cyclones, Day et al. (2018) conducted experiments with the CESM1-CAM5 climate model under a high GHG emission scenario [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74" class="xref">74</xref>••]. They compared Arctic cyclone properties during 2071–2080 with those revealed over 1990–2005 in their historical simulation and found the response to vary with season. In winter, they found a significant reduction in both the number and intensity of storms, and a strong decrease in the frequency with which strong cyclones occur. The cyclone decrease was particularly marked in a band from Greenland to the Norwegian Sea, consistent with observed increases in high-latitude blocking near Greenland [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76" class="xref">76</xref>]. By contrast they identified an increase in cyclone activity in the summer season and a rise in the frequency of strong storms. Their analysis allowed them to posit that this strong seasonality was associated with changes in the high-latitude meridional temperature gradient. In winter, this gradient is weakened as a result of amplified Arctic warming, while it is strengthened in summer because of the enhanced warming of high latitude continents compared to the Arctic Ocean.
