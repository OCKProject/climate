<p id="Par5" class="p">This review forms part of a Topical Collection on Climate Change and Atmospheric Circulation. Here, we focus on the polar regions, but also consider relevant aspects of the mid-latitude atmospheric circulation that are intimately connected to changes in the polar regions. Other papers in this Collection cover the tropical convergence zones [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>], subtropical highs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">7</xref>] and blocking [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">8</xref>]. Our review is not intended to cover all aspects of the polar circulation but, instead, focuses on selected areas of research where significant scientific advances have been made in the past 5Â years. In the following sections, we report on progress in understanding the past and projected future climate change response of the following atmospheric circulation phenomena: the northern and southern stratospheric polar vortices, Arctic and sub-Antarctic cyclones, Arctic moist intrusions, and the Amundsen Sea Low. We also consider the dominant modes of atmospheric circulation variability in the extratropics of each hemisphere, namely the Northern Annular Mode and Southern Annular Mode. Rather than describing each of these circulation features now, we provide some background within the relevant sections. We deal first with the Arctic, then the Antarctic, and lastly, reflect on the differences and similarities between circulation changes in the two polar regions.
