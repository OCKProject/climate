 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>]. Whilst the basic physics of global warming is clear, the response of the atmospheric circulation at the regional scale is less well known [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>]. This poses a challenge to the attribution of past climate change to human influence and is a large source of uncertainty in climate projections. As Shepherd (2014) puts it: “nearly everything we have any confidence in when it comes to climate change is related to global patterns of surface temperature, which are primarily controlled by thermodynamics. In contrast, we have much less confidence in atmospheric circulation aspects of climate change, which are primarily controlled by dynamics and exert a strong control on regional climate” [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>]. This is especially true for the high latitudes, where internal variability of the atmospheric circulation is a major source of uncertainty in projected climate change [
