<p id="Par31" class="p">Analyses of past variability indicate that the ASL has deepened in recent decades in association with the increasingly positive polarity of the SAM. However, the drivers of change in the ASL are particularly complex to understand since it is situated in the region of largest atmospheric pressure variability in the Southern Hemisphere [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122" class="xref">122</xref>]. Consistent with this, observations and model results show that a significant part of changes in the post-1979 modern satellite era can be linked to tropical variability. Most notably, El Niño and La Niña are associated with weakening and intensification of the ASL, respectively, in association with a Rossby wave train from the central Pacific that is most prominent in winter. This Rossby wave train is a key explanation for the occurrence of the Pacific South American Pattern (PSA), which is a winter-dominated pattern of troughs and ridges that connects ENSO variability in the tropical Pacific with West Antarctica and the Antarctic Peninsula [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123" class="xref">123</xref>] and in particular, the depth of the ASL [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119" class="xref">119</xref>]. However, more recently, the importance of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) in spring has been highlighted in association with a wave train propagating from further west in the tropical Pacific that is consistent with a deepening of the ASL linked to the recent trend towards a negative polarity of the PDO [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124" class="xref">124</xref>]. The importance of tropical variability relative to external drivers such as GHG in explaining recent trends was highlighted by Schneider and Deser (2017), who found that historically forced climate model simulations only reproduced observed ASL deepening when tropical sea surface temperature variability was constrained to observed variability [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125" class="xref">125</xref>••]. Some climate models do, however, exhibit significant deepening of the ASL in response to stratospheric ozone depletion alone [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126" class="xref">126</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127" class="xref">127</xref>], so it is possible that both tropical drivers and stratospheric ozone have contributed significantly.
