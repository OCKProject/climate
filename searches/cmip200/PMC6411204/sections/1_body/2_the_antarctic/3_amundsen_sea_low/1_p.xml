<p id="Par30" class="p">The Amundsen Sea Low (ASL) is a climatological low-pressure centre, which migrates seasonally west towards the Ross Sea in winter and east towards the Bellingshausen Sea in summer [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117" class="xref">117</xref>]. It is a key influence on variability of Antarctic-wide zonal wave numbers 1 and 3 since it forms one of the troughs of climatological wave-3 and also occurs in the vicinity of the ridge of wave-1 [
