<p id="Par32" class="p">Looking at future climate change projections, Hosking et al. (2016) found that out of a subset of 11 CMIP5 models, selected based on skill at representing the ASL, the majority simulate a poleward migration of the ASL over the twenty-first century austral summer and autumn [

These changes are less consistent than the hemispheric-scale strengthening and poleward shift of the westerly jet that are simulated across the CMIP5 ensemble under the same future scenario, thus illustrating the greater uncertainty in projections of smaller-scale regional circulation change around Antarctica.
