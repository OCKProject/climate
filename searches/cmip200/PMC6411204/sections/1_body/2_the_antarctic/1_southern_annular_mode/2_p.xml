<p id="Par25" class="p">The depletion of stratospheric ozone and resulting strengthening of the polar vortex in the late twentieth century caused a major shift in Southern Hemisphere tropospheric climate, inducing a more positive SAM index mainly in the summer season (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80" class="xref">80</xref>,

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85" class="xref">85</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91" class="xref">91</xref>]. The causal chain for this starts with the fact that ozone absorbs solar radiation, and therefore in sunlit seasons, the depletion of stratospheric ozone induces local radiative cooling of the polar stratospheres [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92" class="xref">92</xref>]. In response to cooling, the stratospheric polar vortex strengthens as changes in the vertical shear of zonal wind adjust to maintain thermal wind balance. Antarctic stratospheric ozone depletion is most pronounced in late winter/early spring since the chemical reactions responsible are linked to polar stratospheric clouds that form in the very cold conditions of the polar night [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93" class="xref">93</xref>]. Consequently, there is a strong seasonality in polar ozone-related stratospheric cooling trends, which are most pronounced in early spring. In observations, the resulting stratospheric circulation anomalies propagate downwards gradually during spring to exhibit the strongest impact in summer [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80" class="xref">80</xref>]. Identifying the precise mechanisms for this downward propagation is still a topic of debate [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83" class="xref">83</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94" class="xref">94</xref>]. Despite uncertainty over the mechanisms, there is strong consensus that stratospheric ozone depletion has had an impact on tropospheric circulation based on evidence from both observations and modelling, and both in terms of the detection of the shift and its attribution to ozone depletion [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95" class="xref">95</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96" class="xref">96</xref>]. This consensus has been increased in recent years due to the more widespread use of atmospheric models that extend high enough to include most of the stratosphere (so-called high top models), which more consistently reproduce the stratospheric impacts and downward propagation of circulation anomalies associated with stratospheric ozone depletion [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97" class="xref">97</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98" class="xref">98</xref>]. However, the precise mechanisms for the transfer of signals from the stratosphere to the surface are still a subject of debate [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94" class="xref">94</xref>]. Accurate modelling and improved understanding of mechanisms are important for accurately simulating the relative contribution from other factors that can influence the SAM. In particular, increasing GHG have likely re-enforced the recent ozone-induced SAM increases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99" class="xref">99</xref>]. The proportion of this contribution is, however, difficult to establish since multi-decadal climate variability has also been implicated as an important contributor to decadal time-scale SAM index trends [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100" class="xref">100</xref>]. For example, a key role for decadal cooling of the western tropical Pacific has been identified as contributing to observed positive austral summer and autumn SAM index trends that have occurred since the end of rapid ozone depletion in the late 1990s [
