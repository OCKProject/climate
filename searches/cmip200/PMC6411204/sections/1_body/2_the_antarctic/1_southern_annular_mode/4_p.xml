<p id="Par27" class="p">Looking to the future, further change is likely across a range of emission scenarios, but the character and even sign of these changes depends on a delicate balance between the relative contributions from a range of drivers. The CMIP5 models include either prescribed or simulated stratospheric ozone recovery over the twenty-first century to near pre-ozone-hole levels by 2100. Therefore, climate models exhibit a cancellation between SAM index decreases associated with stratospheric ozone recovery and SAM index increases associated with increased GHG and global warming. The most up-to-date studies indicate an approximate cancellation of effects for medium emission scenarios, mainly in summer (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>), but for high emission scenarios, a dominance of GHG driving overall SAM increases across all seasons by the year 2100 [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104" class="xref">104</xref>]. However, for a given scenario, the CMIP5 models still produce a wide range in projected changes [

Diversity across different climate models in simulations of future changes in the SAM has been linked to a range of different processes including: uncertainties in the representation of shortwave radiative forcing (associated with clouds) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107" class="xref">107</xref>]; and uncertainties associated with the response of the coupled ocean-atmosphere-ice system across different timescales [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111" class="xref">111</xref>]. In terms of the coupled system, recent research has shown that the jet strength component of projected westerly change is highly correlated with biases in Antarctic sea ice across the CMIP5 models [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112" class="xref">112</xref>]. Models with excessive sea ice in their baseline climate simulate more retreat in the future and more polar amplification. This stronger polar amplification weakens the lower-tropospheric temperature gradient across the storm track and acts to cancel out some of the strengthening of the westerlies that occurs due to other processes (in particular, increasing upper-tropospheric temperature gradients). This indicates a potential avenue for constraining future projections of the westerlies based on observed baseline climate, although improved understanding of the mechanisms involved is required.
