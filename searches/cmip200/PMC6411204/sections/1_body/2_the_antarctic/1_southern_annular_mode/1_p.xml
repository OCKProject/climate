<p id="Par24" class="p">In recent decades, significant and robust large-scale changes have been observed in atmospheric circulation over Antarctica and the Southern Ocean [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80" class="xref">80</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85" class="xref">85</xref>]. These changes are of major importance in terms of impacts on the broader coupled atmosphere-ocean-ice system across Antarctica and the Southern Ocean [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83" class="xref">83</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86" class="xref">86</xref>]. The dominant pattern of lower- and mid-tropospheric circulation variability at high southern latitudes is the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) or Antarctic Oscillation. A more positive phase of SAM is associated with anomalously low atmospheric pressure over Antarctica and higher pressure at lower latitudes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81" class="xref">81</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87" class="xref">87</xref>]. In recent years, more direct diagnostics of the circumpolar mid-latitude southern near-surface westerlies (hereinafter the westerly jet) have become an important part of quantifying and understanding SAM-related changes in hemispheric-scale circulation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88" class="xref">88</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90" class="xref">90</xref>]. Strengthening and/or poleward shifting of the westerly jet are associated with a more positive SAM index and vice versa.
