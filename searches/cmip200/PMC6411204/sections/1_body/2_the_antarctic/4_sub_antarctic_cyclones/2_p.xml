<p id="Par34" class="p">Grieger et al. (2018) undertook a comprehensive analysis of sub-Antarctic cyclones making use of 14 state-of-the-art tracking methods applied to the ERA-Interim reanalysis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR132" class="xref">132</xref>]. Robust positive trends in cyclone numbers were identified by almost all methods for austral summer over the hemispheric region south of 60Â°S, mainly due to the strong relation to SAM, and in the Amundsen-Bellingshausen Seas sector. Fewer methods indicated significant positive trends over the East Antarctica and Weddell sectors. Trends in austral winter were positive for most regions and methods, but only statistically significant using some tracking methods.
