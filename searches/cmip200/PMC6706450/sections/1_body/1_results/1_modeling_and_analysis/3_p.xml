 </sup>. Here we evaluate the integrated climatology–hydrodynamic modeling system by comparing the flood return period estimates derived from the NCEP-based synthetic TCs for the historical period of 1980–2005 to those based on the observed water levels at tide gauge stations for the same period. Comparisons show a good agreement between the modeled and observation-based flood level estimates for relatively short return periods that can be resolved based on the observations during the relatively short historical period, although larger return levels cannot be well resolved from the observations and wide uncertainty bounds exist (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>). To assist the spatial comparison of flood hazards, the flood heights are determined relative to the local mean higher high water.
