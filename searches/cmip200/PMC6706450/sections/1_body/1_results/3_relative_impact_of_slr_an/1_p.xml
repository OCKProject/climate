 <sub class="sub">100 year</sub> of 1.07 m (35% increase in the average

 <sub class="sub">100 year</sub>) in the Gulf of Mexico (averaged over all counties in this region), 1.08 m (74%) in the southwest Atlantic, 1.38 m (165%) in the mid-Atlantic, and 1.58 m (239%) in New England. The effect of TC climatology change varies along the coastlines in a contrary way. The TC climatology change alone increases

 <sub class="sub">100 year</sub> by about 0.93 m (31% increase in the average

The largest-projected TC induced change in the 100-year flood level is about 1.5 m for several coastal counties in Mississippi and Louisiana. Our projections show a
