<p id="Par23" class="p">We recommend that future studies on coastal flood hazards take into account effects of ETCs and precipitation. In the northeast region of the United States, especially in New England, coastal flooding induced by ETCs are more frequent (but less destructive) than TC-induced flooding

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">35</xref>
 </sup>, which can increase coastal flood hazards for certain regions. Thus, future studies should evaluate changes in coastal flood levels under compound effects of SLR and climatology change of TCs, ETCs, and related precipitation.
