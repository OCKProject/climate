 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">25</xref>

 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">25</xref>

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref>
 </sup> to calculate the (1 min) storm wind at the gradient level based on the maximum wind speed and radius of maximum wind. For use in the ADCIRC model, we convert the gradient wind to the surface level (10 m above the sea surface) with a velocity reduction factor of 0.85 and an empirical expression of inflow angles

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">38</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">39</xref>
 </sup>. We add to the storm wind the surface environmental wind estimated as a fraction (0.55, rotated counterclockwise by 20

The water level at the open boundaries is specified by eight major tidal constituents K1, K2, M2, N2, O1, P1, Q1, and S2. Tidal data, including amplitudes and phases, are obtained from the global model of ocean tides TPXO8–ATLAS with a 1/30° resolution
