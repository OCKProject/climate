<p id="Par4" class="p">The purpose of this study is to identify the model(s) suitable for global as well as regional (monsoonal) scale simulations with realistic features and explore if some of the widely used model improvement techniques can be applied to the selected model(s) to reduce biases. The existing model biases are computed by inter-comparison with observations and reanalysis datasets

 </sup>. In the assessment of biases, this study is confined primarily to the two most important model variables, namely, surface air temperature (T2m) and precipitation. We would like to emphasize that the primary objective of the paper is to check if any of the employed methods (i.e., increased resolution, manual tuning, and semi-automatic tuning) is successful in reducing model biases. The reason for testing these methods is that they are widely used (excepting the semi-automatic tuning which is quite recent and not as widely used) by climate modeling groups worldwide in the process of model improvement. Simple statistical means such as bias correction can easily be used for correcting biases in the mean state as well as the distribution, but that does not lead to model improvement, since it is only a post-processing exercise done to the model outputs. Thus, reducing model biases using statistical techniques is beyond the scope of the current work.
