<p id="Par3" class="p">There are long standing biases, especially in the tropical regions, that have remained since several generations of models over the decades. Many of these models have participated in the CMIP5

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>
 </sup> project, with their inherent systematic biases. These biases inherited in the CGCMs pose serious complications in the interpretation of the results generated. Owing to the intricate shape of the Indian land mass and Indian Ocean basin, the region has strong seasonal influence of the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) variation. These CGCMs are coarser in resolution, so any attempt to oversee their regional imprints suffers from large biases. Attempts have been made to rectify these long-term systematic biases

 </sup> through various methods. Methods that have been used in the past for bias reduction include manual tuning, increasing model resolution
