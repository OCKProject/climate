 </sup> are developed with an objective to accurately simulate the global climate, simulating the regional climate of the corresponding model development centers is often the highest priority. Also, it is not practical for every country to have enough resources for developing their own climate model. Large biases in climate simulations over the Indian region leads to low confidence in the climate change projections and the subsequent impact assessment studies. Also, such models cannot be used for process understanding, hypothesis testing, and future projections due to the high degree of non-linearity in the system. However, building a model with zero bias may not be practically feasible. Thus, instead of hoping for a model with zero bias in all the relevant climatic parameters, we should make efforts to reduce the bias to the maximum extent possible. Seasonal mean T2m and precipitation are the most important parameters that are required in several impact assessment studies and hence have been used in this study.
