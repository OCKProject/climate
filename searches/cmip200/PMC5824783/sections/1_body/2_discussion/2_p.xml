<p id="Par32" class="p">The model tuning through manual methods is exhaustive and time-consuming. Yet, it provides better model configuration for simulation of regional climate. The results from this study show that increase in horizontal resolution alone will not improve the simulation effectively unless the model is simultaneously tuned. On the other hand, not much can be achieved simply by manually tuning the model. We show that automatic parameter tuning is not that effective, specifically in the context of Indian summer monsoon simulations. Therefore, it is suggested that both manual and automated tuning should go hand in hand. The existing CGCMs are developed at reputed institutions keeping the characteristics of climates of certain specific regions in mind. Therefore, in order to simulate the spatial and temporal characteristics of T2m and precipitation close to their observed values, it is paramount to adopt a combination of manual and automated tuning methods simultaneously along with enhancing the resolution of the model. Efforts are going on in this direction by identifying the sources of biases at each important stages of model tuning.</p>
