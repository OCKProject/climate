<p id="Par12" class="p">Considering all the models of CMIP5 at different resolutions, most of the models having low resolution show larger bias over land. Thus, the resolution seems to play an important role over land. Therefore, in this section, model sensitivity to the change in the horizontal resolution is studied, for T2m and precipitation parameters. Ensemble of six members (with different initial conditions as discussed in Section 4) for each resolution is considered for the study. Systematic improvement in the simulation pattern (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>) and reduction in biases (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4a</xref>) for both the parameters is observed with increase in resolution. This improvement in the simulation of surface variables may be attributed to improved representation of orography and coastlines at high horizontal resolution. But the increased resolution does not always lead to an improvement in all the aspects. For example, by comparing the spatial plot of T2m (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a</xref>) at various model resolutions it is found that the model with higher resolution has a better representation of the spatial features but in terms of magnitude, there is an underestimation over the Arabian Sea region.

 </sup> investigated the role of dynamics and physics parameterization in resolution sensitivity using a model with full physics on a standard grid and increasing the resolution of the dynamics. They found that with increase in resolution, regional precipitation features and precipitation intensity distributions improved. A similar result i.e. the improvement in simulations with increasing horizontal resolution is demonstrated in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>. The impact of an increase in horizontal resolution is seen from 2° to 0.5° on T2m compared with MERRA reanalysis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a(i)</xref>) and precipitation compared with TRMM datasets (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b(i)</xref>). A marked improvement is observed in the T2m (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a</xref>) from the coarse to fine model resolutions. The spatial patterns of JJAS mean T2m for 2° resolution (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a(ii) and (v)</xref>) has a large bias over the Indo-Gangetic plains and Tibet over land. Over water bodies, the pattern is similar to the MERRA with few spatial biases over Indian Ocean. In the 1° resolution (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a(iii) and (vi)</xref>), there is a significant improvement in the T2m with few biases over land mainly due to the enhanced model resolution, which results in a detailed representation of orography, however, no significant improvement is seen over the water bodies. The model with 0.5° resolution (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a(iv) and a(vii)</xref>) captures well most of the high and low T2m features over Indian sub-continent but underestimates the surface temperature over Arabia, Iran, and oceanic regions.
