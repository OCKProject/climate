 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> describes the PCC and NRMSE variability of model variables like Precipitation (PRECT), Surface Air Temperature at 2m Height (T2m), Precipitable Water (PWAT), Surface Evaporation (EVP), Total Cloud (CLDTOT), High Cloud (CLDHGH), Middle Cloud (CLDMED) and Low Cloud (CLDLOW) in three domains, namely, Monsoon (50°E:100°E, 5°N:38.5°N), Tropics (0°E:360°E, 30°S:30°N), and Global (0°E-360°E, 90°S-90°N). The statistical measures of model variables are demonstrated for three horizontal resolutions, 2° (red color), 1° (green color), and 0.5° (blue color). Precipitation in the Monsoon and Tropical domains have been compared with 10 year TRMM data as it has higher grid resolution, while 10 years of MERRA reanalysis was used for comparison in the Global domain. Precipitation has higher pattern correlation and low NRMSE in global domain compared to the Monsoon and Tropical domains, with higher resolution. Being a matter of surprise, precipitation in the tropical domain has better performance for 1° resolution. T2m in the Monsoon domain (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4(a)</xref>) can be identified distinctly, with a higher resolution mostly having higher PCC and lower NRMSE values. Similar features are seen in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4(c)</xref> but with partial overlapping. In Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4(b)</xref>, over the tropical region, 2° resolution model has better correlation, closely followed by 0.5° model resolution, with 1° model ending last. PWAT in all three domains (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4(a–c)</xref>) follow the normal trend of improvement with increasing resolution, but between 1° and 0.5° the improvement is very small. For EVP, the above trend is not followed where 1° takes the lead followed by 0.5° model resolution and 2° model is the last one in all the three domains. CLDTOT and CLDHGH have high PCC and low NRMSE for 0.5° in Monsoon Domain (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4(a)</xref>). In the Tropical domain, a similar pattern is followed. On the other hand, the Global domain indicates that 2° model has the best PCC and 0.5° has the worst values of PCC and NRMSE for CLDTOT. In Tropics and Global domain, 0.5° model resolution has better values of PCC and NRMSE followed by 1° and 2°, respectively. For CLDMED variable in the Monsoon and Tropics, there is an improvement in the value of PCC with an increase in resolution. In the Global domain, depreciation in PCC but improvement in NRMSE is observed with increase in resolution. For CLDLOW variable, in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4(a–c)</xref>, the 1° model resolution has better values of PCC and NRMSE followed by 0.5° and 2°, respectively.
