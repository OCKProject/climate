<p id="Par13" class="p">Largely, increasing the horizontal resolution enhances the spatial precipitation accuracy of the finer model compared to TRMM datasets (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b</xref>). But again the precipitation is underestimated over the Burmese Mountains and adjoining water bodies. The spatial patterns of JJAS mean precipitation for 2° resolution (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b(ii)</xref>) has large biases over the Western Ghats, Himalaya, Myanmar and the Indian Ocean regions. These biases decrease significantly for 1° (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b(vi)</xref>) and 0.5° resolution (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b(vii)</xref>) owing to improved horizontal model resolution. Still, in all three-model resolutions, the systematic bias is present over the Indian Ocean. These biases show high rainfall over the western Indian Ocean, which is in contrast to the TRMM observations.
