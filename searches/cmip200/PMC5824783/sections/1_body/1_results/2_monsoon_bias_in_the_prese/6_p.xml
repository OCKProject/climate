It overestimates the precipitation over the southwest tip of India and Burmese Mountains. One of the notable things that can be observed from Fig.

 </sup>, the performance of coupled models are analyzed and found large biases in the mean rainfall pattern simulated by the models. They reported that, in general, rainfall over the equatorial Indian Ocean was overestimated, whereas it was underestimated over the Indian sub-continent. They reported that none of the models were able to successfully simulate the major features of Indian monsoon rainfall distribution, such as the maximum over Bay of Bengal and adjoining northeast India and west coast and minimum over NW India and southeast India. The above analysis indicates that model improvement is necessary to generate confidence in future projections. We have selected NCAR CAM5
