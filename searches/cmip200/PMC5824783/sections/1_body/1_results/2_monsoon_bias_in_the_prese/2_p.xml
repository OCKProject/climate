<p id="Par7" class="p">JJAS climatological mean of 31 years (1975–2005) was used from CMIP5 historical datasets. Surface air temperature and precipitation outputs are analyzed for 28 models, through PCC and NRMSE (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). For the selected Monsoon region, the PCC values for T2m and precipitation are positive. 12 and 15 out of the 28 models show PCC values above 0.7 for precipitation and above 0.95 for T2m, respectively. Similarly, around 14 out of 28 models show NRMSE values below 0.7 for precipitation and below 0.12 for T2m.
