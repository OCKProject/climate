<p id="Par8" class="p">The CESM1-CAM5 has the highest PCC (0.9848) and low NRMSE (0.0715) value with MERRA T2m. However, FGOALS-g2 has the lowest PCC (0.8862) and highest NRMSE (0.1977) values. Thus, with respect to T2m CESM1-CAM5 is found to have performed better among all the models and FGOALS-g2 stands last. Similarly, HadCM3, MIROC5 and ACCESS1.0 have the PCC above 0.75 and NRMSE around 0.6 with TRMM precipitation, and GISS-E2H has the lowest PCC (0.4458) and highest NRMSE (1.365) among all the 28 models. Therefore HadCM3 is better model among 28 models and GISS-E2H is the less skillful model according to precipitation.</p>
