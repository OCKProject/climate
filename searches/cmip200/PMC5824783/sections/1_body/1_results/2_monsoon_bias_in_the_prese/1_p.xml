<p id="Par6" class="p">In this section monsoon biases in CMIP5 models are described using two statistical measures, namely, the Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) and spatial pattern correlation coefficient using Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) calculated over the monsoon region (5°N-38.5°N; 50°E-100° E). These statistical measures are used to assess the accuracy of the model variables with respect to observations. Here observation includes TRMM dataset for precipitation and MERRA dataset for all other variables (see Section 4 for details). For the normalization, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is divided by the area averaged observational value. PCC indicates the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables. This correlation coefficient is obtained by dividing the covariance of the two variables by the product of their standard deviations. For the calculation of NRMSE and PCC, model results and observations are interpolated bi-linearly to a common grid. In cases where the model is coarser than the observations, which is generally true in our case, the observations are interpolated to the model grid, else vice-versa (done only for MIROC-4h).</p>
