<p id="Par10" class="p">In Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> spatial patterns for the better and less skillful model from CMIP5 are spatially compared with MERRA reanalysis for T2m and TRMM data for precipitation. Surface air temperature is both underestimated and overestimated over different regions within the monsoon domain in the better model (CESM1-CAM5) as well as the less skillful model (FGOALS-g2). The better model underestimated the high-temperature regions of Arabia, Iran, Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal, and Indian Ocean and low-temperature regions of Tibet (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a(ii) and (iv)</xref>). Few regions like Southern India show an overestimate in the temperature variation, especially over interior Karnataka (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a(iv)</xref>). In the less skillful model the center of high temperature over Indian subcontinent is shifted by 5° to the southeast direction (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a(i) and (iii)</xref>). By and large, the better model has captured well the broad features of temperature distribution in the area of analysis but the same cannot be said for precipitation (as discussed below).
