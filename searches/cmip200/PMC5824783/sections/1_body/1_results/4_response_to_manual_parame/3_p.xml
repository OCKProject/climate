<p id="Par18" class="p">The T2m as seen in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5a(i)</xref> shows very clear and distinct model variability for both the resolutions, having a clear demarcation in the monsoon domain. Model tuning does not lead to much improvement in PCC of the T2m in the Tropical domain (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5a</xref>
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">(ii)</xref>). One can see that the best model configuration in the 1° resolution turns out to be the worst 2° model configuration. In the Global domain (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5a(iii)</xref>), one of the 2 ° model configuration (c0_ocn = 0.01, c0_lnd = 0.0059) has high PCC and is in the range of 1° model simulations. Here the range of PCC values for both the resolutions are very close. For the T2m, the model has higher pattern correlation, especially on the global scale. After model tuning, T2m shows improvement in the range 2–16% for 2° resolution and 1–8% for 1° resolution from the respective control simulations.
