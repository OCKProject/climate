<p id="Par20" class="p">Impact of resolutions is also seen on Precipitable Water from Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5c(i–iii)</xref>. 1° resolution CTL simulation, similar to precipitation, has values of PCC and NRMSE in top four. Some of the model configurations of 2° resolutions show better performance than few of the model configuration of 1° resolution. For Precipitable Water, the improvement after model tuning for 2° resolution is in the range of 4–8% and for the 1° resolution, it is in the range 1–4%.
