 <sup class="sup">o</sup>, in general, underestimates the T2m by 2 °C but simulated well the observed broad features of MERRA data, especially over land and Bay of Bengal. Similarly, the 1
 <sup class="sup">o</sup> model has underestimated T2m over Arabia and Iran (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6a(viii)</xref>). It has overestimation over Gangetic plains, Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean. It has very well captured the summer heat low over the western India and Pakistan and over south India (Fig.
