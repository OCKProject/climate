<p id="Par25" class="p">Thus, it is seen that the model tuning process implemented on 2° resolution yields significant improvement (on an average 16%) in all the five parameters, for the three domains. The 1° model resolution shows only mild improvement of 8% at the maximum even after rigorous manual parameter tuning. This may be due to the fact that CAM5 used here was developed and already tuned for 1° resolution. Here it may be noted that the 5 parameters chosen (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>) are based on existing literature as well as our own experience. The reported range of percentage improvement may slightly vary by either having a smaller subset or a different set of parameters. It is also seen that the 2° model could be made as good as 1° one. Considering the example from Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5b(iii)</xref>, the model configuration (c0_ocn = 0.01 and c0_lnd = 0.0059) has best values for 2° model resolution and has even higher values from its 1° model resolution counterpart. It is better than at least 5 model configurations of 1° model. So if this configuration of 2° model resolution is fine-tuned further it could be further improved. If this 2° model configuration is made as default it could save huge computing power and resources. Therefore, it can be concluded that the coarse grid models can be suitably tuned to match most of the results of fine grid models.
