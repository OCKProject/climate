<p id="Par24" class="p">The precipitation variation simulated by the models and obtained from TRMM dataset is depicted in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6b (i–v)</xref> and anomalies are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6b(vi–ix)</xref>. All the models show overestimation in simulating precipitation. The 1° resolution best model configuration broadly captures the prime features of Indian monsoon precipitation, although with few biases. These biases include overestimation of precipitation over the Himalayas, Western Ghats, Central India and Eastern Indian Ocean. The model underestimates the precipitation over Myanmar coastline.
