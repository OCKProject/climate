<p id="Par21" class="p">There is clear improvement in surface evaporation (EVP) values (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5d(i–iii)</xref>) with increase in horizontal resolution. However, few model configurations (c0_ocn = 0.005 and c0_ocn = 0.001; ke = 0.5E-6) with 2
 <sup class="sup">o</sup> resolution perform much better than 1
 <sup class="sup">o</sup> model configurations. In the 1
 <sup class="sup">o</sup> resolution setup of global domain, CTL has the best configuration, and among top five in the rest of the two (tropical and monsoon domains). Evaporation parameter has improved in the range 7–16% for 2
 <sup class="sup">o</sup> resolution and 1–7% for 1
 <sup class="sup">o</sup> resolution after model tuning.
