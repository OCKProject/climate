 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5b(i–iii)</xref>), the impact of an increase in resolution is seen as an improvement in precipitation values. The model configuration (c0_ocn = 0.01, c0_lnd = 0.0059) has the best value of PCC and NRMSE for 2° model and worst value of PCC and NRMSE for 1°. Thus, one may conclude that a model setup that works for the 2° resolution may respond differently to 1° model resolution. The model CTL(s) with 1° resolution is among the top five best configurations, while last five for the 2° resolution. In general, PCC values increase and NRMSE values decrease as the domain size is increased from Monsoon to Tropical to Global. The model precipitation has improved in the range, 10–25% for 2° resolution and in the range of 4–9% for 1° resolution, after model tuning.
