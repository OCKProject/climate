<p id="Par17" class="p">A number of simulations with various combinations of values for tunable parameters were performed for a short period of 6 months (starting April 1
 <sup class="sup">st</sup>). More than 60 simulations for each of 2° and 1° model resolution were performed for different parameters listed in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>. Here we have summarized results of best 15 simulations for each of the model resolutions. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref> demonstrates NRMSE along with PCC for Indian Monsoon region, Tropics and Global domains. The five variables that are represented here are Surface Air Temperature, Precipitation, Precipitable Water, Surface Evaporation and Total Cloud. Discussion of various parameters for the above-mentioned three regions has been done below.
