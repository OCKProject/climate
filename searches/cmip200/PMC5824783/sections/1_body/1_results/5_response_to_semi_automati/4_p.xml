<p id="Par29" class="p">In Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7(b)</xref>, the PCC and NRMSE are shown for T2m, U850, U200, V850, V200, EVP, PWAT, CLDTOT, CLDHGH, CLDMED, and CLDLOW over Indian land. The variables from CTL simulation are shown in red, whereas, OPT variables are shown in green. In most of the OPT experiment cases e.g., T2m, U850, V850, EVP, PWAT, CLDMED, and CLDLOW, improvement in NRMSE and PCC by 2–6% is seen, whereas, U200, V200, CLDTOT and CLDHGH have better values for CTL experiment.
