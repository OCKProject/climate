 </sup> in 1965. This is a heuristic method that does not require derivative of the function but only function evaluation for its operation. The Downhill Simplex is a fast converging algorithm when the parametric space is not high dimensional. However, it is a local optimization algorithm, not aiming to find the global optimal solution. Moreover, the algorithm has convergence issues when the simplex becomes ill conditioned. A three-step method is used to reduce the number of parameters for analysis, which favours the fast convergence of Downhill Simplex method. Also, since it performs the best optimization under local conditions and owing to computational costs, the experiment is designed and simulated only over the domain extending from 0–40°N and 60–100°E. Results of the study are summarized for Indian landmass only. The details of the method adopted are described in Methodology section at the end.
