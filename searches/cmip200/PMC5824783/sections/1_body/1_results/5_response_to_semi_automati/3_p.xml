<p id="Par28" class="p">A control (CTL) experiment with April initial condition was initiated and 19 successive simulations were performed by Downhill simplex method to reach the optimal simulation. In Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7(a)</xref>, the NRMSE along with PCC is shown for precipitation. In this figure, the successive simulations are depicted as blue circles, CTL experiment is denoted by red spade, and the optimized (OPT) experiment with a filled green circle. It is seen that the optimized value has the best NRMSE amongst all the experiments performed, but it is not having the best PCC value.
