<p id="Par26" class="p">Traditionally, model development has prospered and progressed through time intensive manual tuning methods, involving comprehensive comparison of model parameters with observations. With the advent of various optimization methods, attempts have been made to automate these time intensive processes. There are several algorithms such as Simulated Stochastic Approximation Annealing (SSAA) method
