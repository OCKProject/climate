 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8(a)</xref> represents the spatial pattern of the JJAS mean T2m for CTL and OPT, compared with those in MERRA dataset. The spatial pattern of the JJAS mean precipitation in CTL and OPT is compared with IMD data in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8(b)</xref>. The CTL and OPT do not have much difference in T2m. Similarly, OPT is not better than CTL when compared for precipitation. On comparing with IMD values, OPT and CTL configuration mostly overestimated the precipitation, especially over mountainous regions.
