A CGCM with the capability to reliably project the global as well as the regional climatic features would be a valuable tool for scientists and policymakers. Analysis of 28 CMIP5 models highlights varying degree of biases in precipitation and 2&#x02009;m surface air temperature (T2m) over south Asia, and the Community Earth System Model (CESM) developed at the National Center for Atmospheric Research is found to be one of the best performing models. However, like all other CMIP5 models, CESM also has some inherent model biases. Using CESM, it is found that the precipitation and T2M biases reduce with increase in the model horizontal resolution from 2&#x000b0; to 0.5&#x000b0;. Further, a few deep convective parameters in the Zhang-McFarlane convection scheme are tuned for 2&#x000b0; and 1&#x000b0; model resolutions using both manual and semi-automatic model tuning methods. Comparing results from the two tuning methods we find that the performance of the manually tuned model is better than that of the semi-automated one.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Climate simulations performed with coupled global climate models (CGCMs) are widely viewed as the principal scientific basis for developing policies to address potential future global climate change<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has an immense contribution towards the policy-making decisions of many countries and organizations. Hence, accuracy in the long term climatic projections and analysis is of uttermost importance. Scores of modeling institutions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> have developed sophisticated CGCMs. No doubt, after decades of development and improvements these models simulate the global climate up to a satisfactory level. Still, these models are plagued by many inherent systematic biases.</p><p id="Par3">There are long standing biases, especially in the tropical regions, that have remained since several generations of models over the decades. Many of these models have participated in the CMIP5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> project, with their inherent systematic biases. These biases inherited in the CGCMs pose serious complications in the interpretation of the results generated. Owing to the intricate shape of the Indian land mass and Indian Ocean basin, the region has strong seasonal influence of the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) variation. These CGCMs are coarser in resolution, so any attempt to oversee their regional imprints suffers from large biases. Attempts have been made to rectify these long-term systematic biases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> through various methods. Methods that have been used in the past for bias reduction include manual tuning, increasing model resolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, and semi-automatic tuning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Each of these tuning methods is robust and self-sufficient. It is important to note that the confidence in the future climatic projections will increase if the models simulate the current climate satisfactorily to start with.</p><p id="Par4">The purpose of this study is to identify the model(s) suitable for global as well as regional (monsoonal) scale simulations with realistic features and explore if some of the widely used model improvement techniques can be applied to the selected model(s) to reduce biases. The existing model biases are computed by inter-comparison with observations and reanalysis datasets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. In the assessment of biases, this study is confined primarily to the two most important model variables, namely, surface air temperature (T2m) and precipitation. We would like to emphasize that the primary objective of the paper is to check if any of the employed methods (i.e., increased resolution, manual tuning, and semi-automatic tuning) is successful in reducing model biases. The reason for testing these methods is that they are widely used (excepting the semi-automatic tuning which is quite recent and not as widely used) by climate modeling groups worldwide in the process of model improvement. Simple statistical means such as bias correction can easily be used for correcting biases in the mean state as well as the distribution, but that does not lead to model improvement, since it is only a post-processing exercise done to the model outputs. Thus, reducing model biases using statistical techniques is beyond the scope of the current work.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="Par5">In the following the monsoon bias in present day models are discussed in section 2.1, followed by sensitivity of model simulations to horizontal resolution presented in section 2.2, response to manual parameter tuning in section 2.3, and finally response to semi-automatic parameter tuning in section 2.4.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Monsoon Bias in the Present Day Models</title><p id="Par6">In this section monsoon biases in CMIP5 models are described using two statistical measures, namely, the Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) and spatial pattern correlation coefficient using Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) calculated over the monsoon region (5&#x000b0;N-38.5&#x000b0;N; 50&#x000b0;E-100&#x000b0; E). These statistical measures are used to assess the accuracy of the model variables with respect to observations. Here observation includes TRMM dataset for precipitation and MERRA dataset for all other variables (see Section 4 for details). For the normalization, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is divided by the area averaged observational value. PCC indicates the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables. This correlation coefficient is obtained by dividing the covariance of the two variables by the product of their standard deviations. For the calculation of NRMSE and PCC, model results and observations are interpolated bi-linearly to a common grid. In cases where the model is coarser than the observations, which is generally true in our&#x000a0;case, the observations are interpolated to the model grid, else vice-versa (done only for MIROC-4h).</p><p id="Par7">JJAS climatological mean of 31 years (1975&#x02013;2005) was used from CMIP5 historical datasets. Surface air temperature and precipitation outputs are analyzed for 28 models, through PCC and NRMSE (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). For the selected Monsoon region, the PCC values for T2m and precipitation are positive. 12 and 15 out of the 28 models show PCC values above 0.7 for precipitation and above 0.95 for T2m, respectively. Similarly, around 14 out of 28 models show NRMSE values below 0.7 for precipitation and below 0.12 for T2m.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Scatter plot of Pattern Correlation Coefficient (PCC) and normalized RMSE for JJAS mean: (<bold>a</bold>) Surface Air Temperature and (<bold>b</bold>) Precipitation over the monsoon region (5&#x000b0;N-38.5&#x000b0;N; 60&#x000b0;E-100&#x000b0;E).

Thus, with respect to T2m CESM1-CAM5 is found to have performed better among all the models and FGOALS-g2 stands last. Similarly, HadCM3, MIROC5 and ACCESS1.0 have the PCC above 0.75 and NRMSE around 0.6 with TRMM precipitation, and GISS-E2H has the lowest PCC (0.4458) and highest NRMSE (1.365) among all the 28 models. Therefore HadCM3 is better model among 28 models and GISS-E2H is the less skillful model according to precipitation.</p><p id="Par9">It was found (not shown here) that there is an error of ~10% in the T2m and about 50&#x02013;100% in JJAS mean precipitation.

Surface air temperature is both underestimated and overestimated over different regions within the monsoon domain in the better model (CESM1-CAM5) as well as the less skillful model (FGOALS-g2). The better model underestimated the high-temperature regions of Arabia, Iran, Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal, and Indian Ocean and low-temperature regions of Tibet (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a(ii) and (iv)</xref>).

It overestimates the precipitation over the southwest tip of India and Burmese Mountains. One of the notable things that can be observed from Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref> is that the model closely follows the demarcation line of high precipitation region to low precipitation region. In a relevant study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, the performance of coupled models are analyzed and found large biases in the mean rainfall pattern simulated by the models. They reported that, in general, rainfall over the equatorial Indian Ocean was overestimated, whereas it was underestimated over the Indian sub-continent. They reported that none of the models were able to successfully simulate the major features of Indian monsoon rainfall distribution, such as the maximum over Bay of Bengal and adjoining northeast India and west coast and minimum over NW India and southeast India. The above analysis indicates that model improvement is necessary to generate confidence in future projections. We have selected NCAR CAM5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> for further study since it has the best T2m simulations among the 28 CMIP5 models and performs relatively well for precipitation as well.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Sensitivity to resolution</title><p id="Par12">Considering all the models of CMIP5 at different resolutions, most of the models having low resolution show larger bias over land. Thus, the resolution seems to play an important role over land. Therefore, in this section, model sensitivity to the change in the horizontal resolution is studied, for T2m and precipitation parameters. Ensemble of six members (with different initial conditions as discussed in Section 4) for each resolution is considered for the study. Systematic improvement in the simulation pattern (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) and reduction in biases (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>) for both the parameters is observed with increase in resolution. This improvement in the simulation of surface variables may be attributed to improved representation of orography and coastlines at high horizontal resolution. But the increased resolution does not always lead to an improvement in all the aspects. For example, by comparing the spatial plot of T2m (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>) at various model resolutions it is found that the model with higher resolution has a better representation of the spatial features but in terms of magnitude, there is an underestimation over the Arabian Sea region. Some researchers like Bacmeister <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> and others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> investigated the role of dynamics and physics parameterization in resolution sensitivity using a model with full physics on a standard grid and increasing the resolution of the dynamics. They found that with increase in resolution, regional precipitation features and precipitation intensity distributions improved. A similar result i.e. the improvement in simulations with increasing horizontal resolution is demonstrated in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. The impact of an increase in horizontal resolution is seen from 2&#x000b0; to 0.5&#x000b0; on T2m compared with MERRA reanalysis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a(i)</xref>) and precipitation compared with TRMM datasets (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b(i)</xref>). A marked improvement is observed in the T2m (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>) from the coarse to fine model resolutions. The spatial patterns of JJAS mean T2m for 2&#x000b0; resolution (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a(ii) and (v)</xref>) has a large bias over the Indo-Gangetic plains and Tibet over land. Over water bodies, the pattern is similar to the MERRA with few spatial biases over Indian Ocean. In the 1&#x000b0; resolution (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a(iii) and (vi)</xref>), there is a significant improvement in the T2m with few biases over land mainly due to the enhanced model resolution, which results in a detailed representation of orography, however, no significant improvement is seen over the water bodies. The model with 0.5&#x000b0; resolution (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a(iv) and a(vii)</xref>) captures well most of the high and low T2m features over Indian sub-continent but underestimates the surface temperature over Arabia, Iran, and oceanic regions.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Spatial distribution of JJAS mean: (<bold>a</bold>) Surface Air Temperature in (i) MERRA, (ii) 2&#x000b0;, (iii) 1&#x000b0;, (iv) 0.5&#x000b0; (v) 2&#x000b0; anomaly, (vi) 1&#x000b0; anomaly, (vii) 0.5&#x000b0; anomaly and (<bold>b</bold>) Precipitation in (i) TRMM, (ii) 2&#x000b0;, (iii) 1&#x000b0;, (iv) 0.5&#x000b0; (v) 2&#x000b0; anomaly, (vi) 1&#x000b0; anomaly, (vii) 0.5&#x000b0; anomaly, over the monsoon region.

Precipitation in the Monsoon and Tropical domains have been compared with 10 year TRMM data as it has higher grid resolution, while 10 years of MERRA reanalysis was used for comparison in the Global domain. Precipitation has higher pattern correlation and low NRMSE in global domain compared to the Monsoon and Tropical domains, with higher resolution. Being a matter of surprise, precipitation in the tropical domain has better performance for 1&#x000b0; resolution. T2m in the Monsoon domain (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4(a)</xref>) can be identified distinctly, with a higher resolution mostly having higher PCC and lower NRMSE values.

The 1&#x000b0; model resolution shows only mild improvement of 8% at the maximum even after rigorous manual parameter tuning. This may be due to the fact that CAM5 used here was developed and already tuned for 1&#x000b0; resolution. Here it may be noted that the 5 parameters chosen (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) are based on existing literature as well as our own experience. The reported range of percentage improvement may slightly vary by either having a smaller subset or a different set of parameters. It is also seen that the 2&#x000b0; model could be made as good as 1&#x000b0; one.

It is better than at least 5 model configurations of 1&#x000b0; model. So if this configuration of 2&#x000b0; model resolution is fine-tuned further it could be further improved. If this 2&#x000b0; model configuration is made as default it could save huge computing power and resources. Therefore, it can be concluded that the coarse grid models can be suitably tuned to match most of the results of fine grid models.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Response to Semi-Automatic Parameter Optimization Method</title><p id="Par26">Traditionally, model development has prospered and progressed through time intensive manual tuning methods, involving comprehensive comparison of model parameters with observations.

The Downhill Simplex is a fast converging algorithm when the parametric space is not high dimensional. However, it is a local optimization algorithm, not aiming to find the global optimal solution. Moreover, the algorithm has convergence issues when the simplex becomes ill conditioned. A three-step method is used to reduce the number of parameters for analysis, which favours the fast convergence of Downhill Simplex method. Also, since it performs the best optimization under local conditions and owing to computational costs, the experiment is designed and simulated only over the domain extending from 0&#x02013;40&#x000b0;N and 60&#x02013;100&#x000b0;E.

Also, it is not practical for every country to have enough resources for developing their own climate model. Large biases in climate simulations over the Indian region leads to low confidence in the climate change projections and the subsequent impact assessment studies. Also, such models cannot be used for process understanding, hypothesis testing, and future projections due to the high degree of non-linearity in the system. However, building a model with zero bias may not be practically feasible. Thus, instead of hoping for a model with zero bias in all the relevant climatic parameters, we should make efforts to reduce the bias to the maximum extent possible. Seasonal mean T2m and precipitation are the most important parameters that are required in several impact assessment studies and hence have been used in this study.</p><p id="Par32">The model tuning through manual methods is exhaustive and time-consuming. Yet, it provides better model configuration for simulation of regional climate. The results from this study show that increase in horizontal resolution alone will not improve the simulation effectively unless the model is simultaneously tuned. On the other hand, not much can be achieved simply by manually tuning the model. We show that automatic parameter tuning is not that effective, specifically in the context of Indian summer monsoon simulations. Therefore, it is suggested that both manual and automated tuning should go hand in hand. The existing CGCMs are developed at reputed institutions keeping the characteristics of climates of certain specific regions in mind. Therefore, in order to simulate the spatial and temporal characteristics of T2m and precipitation close to their observed values, it is paramount to adopt a combination of manual and automated tuning methods simultaneously along with enhancing the resolution of the model. Efforts are going on in this direction by identifying the sources of biases at each important stages of model tuning.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Methodology</title><p id="Par33">The study in Section 2.1 uses 28 models from the CMIP phase 5 project (list in the legend of Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cmip-pcmdi.llnl.gov/cmip5/availability.html">http://cmip-pcmdi.llnl.gov/cmip5/availability.html</ext-link>.
