<p class="p">We present a statistically-rigorous novel method to weight multiple models of stochastic dynamical systems by their skill at representing both internal variability (including autocorrelation) and a nonlinear trend of a time series process, and to make predictions of system change under new conditions. The weight is interpreted as a likelihood of a dynamical model being adequate at capturing both trend and variability aspects of the process. This is a particularly important diagnostic given the broad relevance of variability (e.g., variability can affect extreme events such as heat waves and droughts in climate science). We show that the proposed method tends to better identify “true” models in a suite of leave-one-out cross-validation experiments compared to a typically-used trend-only BMA weighting method. The new method also tends to improve forecasts, as judged by the mean 90% credible interval width and mean absolute bias. This has important implications specifically for multi-model climate projections. Applying the method to project Korean summer mean maximum temperature changes over this century considerably increases future projections. Specifically, the mode of 1973–2005 to 2081–2100 warming under the RCP8.5 emissions scenario increases by 1.3 K to 6.6 K, while the mean shifts from 4.9 K to 5.6 K. Furthermore, the pdf becomes 22% sharper as measured by the 90% posterior credible interval.</p>
