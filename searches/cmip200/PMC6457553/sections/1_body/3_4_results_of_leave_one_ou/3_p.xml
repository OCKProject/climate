<p class="p">We now turn our attention to the question of future prediction. First, it is worth noting that we do not find a significant bias between projections and “true” model output in any of our leave-one-out cross-validation experiments. The new method tends to improve in terms of the mean 90% credible interval width as well as mean absolute bias of the mean (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0214535.s001" class="xref">S1 File</xref>). Specifically, in the Korea_temp experiments, the forecast 90% credible intervals on average sharpen by about 25%. For some cases (e.g., models 3 and 22 of the Korea_temp experiment), the improvements are particularly dramatic, featuring a drastic sharpening of the pdf and a strong reduction in the 90% credible intervals, with a low bias; Figs P and Q in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0214535.s001" class="xref">S1 File</xref>). The only cases with no improvement are AMOCIndex, and corresponding AMOCIndex_obs (
 <xref rid="pone.0214535.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). We note that these experiments rely on the same model output. They also use a weaker historical climate forcing during the projection period, whereas other experiments use stronger RCP8.5 future forcing. It is worthwhile noting that the experiments with the improvement boast a visual relationship between sample estimates of variability properties and future changes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0214535.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>). Specifically, models with higher innovation standard deviation tend to produce higher summer mean maximum temperature warming in the Korean temperature experiments. A positive relationship between standard deviation and future temperature change has been previously found in previous work for many regions [
 <xref rid="pone.0214535.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. The relationships for the AMOC experiment are different: future AMOC slowdown appears to be stronger for models with higher autocorrelation and low normalized innovation standard deviation. In the Winter_SST experiment, the relationships also involve both variability properties: higher

Thus, we speculate that the degree of improvement may be related to the strength of statistical relationships between the variability parameters and future change. Testing this hypothesis is left to future work. There can be considerable shifts in the pdf between the “trend” and “trend+var” method (Figs N-Q in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0214535.s001" class="xref">S1 File</xref>). This is consistent with the fact that additional fluctuation data can provide a relatively independent constraint on the model weights.
