<p class="p">Another important metric is the factor

Thus, under our statistical model, the best dynamical models for both “trend” and “trend+var” experiments are approximately equally close to the “true” unobserved trends in the real system, in both calibration and projection periods. However, for the rest of the simulated data experiments the new method achieves a lower
