<p class="p">AMOCIndex experiment (
 <xref rid="pone.0214535.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>) relies on historical output from the same 13 CMIP5 models used for the AMOC experiment. AMOC Index is defined as sea surface temperature in northern North Atlantic “gyre” minus Northern Hemisphere temperature. It is physically linked to northward heat transport by the AMOC, and hence can be used as a proxy for AMOC [

 <xref rid="pone.0214535.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>], with a few changes. The Index is used as an anomaly with respect to the entire historical period 1880–2004. We then use a portion of the historical period (1880–1945) for calibration, and another portion (1965–2004) for projections. Smoothing is performed using Theil-Sen slopes. Projections use the “ar1” variant of the method.
