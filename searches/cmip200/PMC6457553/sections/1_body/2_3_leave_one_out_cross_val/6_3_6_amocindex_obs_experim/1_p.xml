<p class="p">For the AMOCIndex_obs we use actual observations both to weight the models, and to validate the probabilistic projections. Otherwise, the experiment relies on the same model output as AMOCIndex experiment. The observations are a simple average of two AMOC Index versions: one calculated with ERSSTv4 SSTs [

 <xref rid="pone.0214535.ref047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>], and one with COBE-SST2 SSTs [
 <xref rid="pone.0214535.ref048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. ERSSTv4 data is publicly curated by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [
 <xref rid="pone.0214535.ref049" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>], while COBE-SST2 observations are provided by M. Ishii on the servers of Hokkaido University, Japan [
 <xref rid="pone.0214535.ref050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. Both versions use GISTEMP Northern Hemisphere temperatures [
 <xref rid="pone.0214535.ref051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. GISTEMP observations are maintained by NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies [
 <xref rid="pone.0214535.ref052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]. For comparison with model output the COBE-SST2 SSTs are first interpolated to a 2×2° grid using bilinear interpolation, while the ERSSTv4 observations are already on such a grid.
