<p class="p">To evaluate method performance, we carry out leave-one-out cross-validation experiments with several simulated and observed datasets: (i) Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) strength [Sv] from 13 global climate models (GCMs) (AMOC experiment), (ii) Korean summer mean maximum temperatures from 29 GCMs (Korea_temp), (iii) Korean temperatures with an extended calibration period (Korea_temp_long), (iv) winter East Sea surface temperatures (SSTs) (Winter SST Experiment), (v) temperature-based AMOC Index (temperature in northern North Atlantic “gyre” minus Northern Hemisphere temperature) from 13 GCMs (AMOCIndex), and (vi) the same as (v) but also considering information from climate observations (AMOCIndex_obs). We discuss each experiment in greater detail in the following subsections. The cases differ in terms of the calibration, projection, and projection reference periods (

In experiments involving model output only, each of the models is selected as “truth” one at time, and its output is used to weight the models. Then, during the validation period, the projected pdfs of changes using the remaining models are compared to the “true” model output. The set-up for the AMOCIndex_obs is slightly different: both calibration and validation periods have available instrumental observations. Here, instead of selecting each model output as pseudo-observations one-at-a-time, we simply use actual observations to both weight the climate models, and to evaluate the projections. All experiments are performed with both “trend” and “trend+var” methods. Both methods have been calibrated for each experiment to have approximately correct coverage (correct % of cases where the “truth” is outside the 90% posterior credible intervals) by adjusting the model error expansion factor
