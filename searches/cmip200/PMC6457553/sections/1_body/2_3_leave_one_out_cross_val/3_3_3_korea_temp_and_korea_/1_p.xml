<p class="p">Korea_temp and Korea_temp_long differ only in the calibration periods and the error expansion factors 
 <italic class="italic">f</italic>, with Korea_temp_long using a longer calibration period. These experiments use output from historical and future RCP8.5 runs of 29 CMIP5 model runs (

Theil-Sen slopes are used for obtaining model trends during the model output decomposition. During the weighting, smoothed output is used as anomalies with respect to the entire calibration period. Future projections use the “boot” variant of the method. Note that the Korea_temp “trend+var” experiment has a slightly elevated coverage of 93%. Decreasing 
 <italic class="italic">f</italic> to obtain approximately 90% coverage is expected to improve performance metrics, but also to make probability densities too discontinuous. Hence, we use the value of 
 <italic class="italic">f</italic> = 0.75.
