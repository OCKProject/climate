<p class="p">For the AMOC experiment (
 <xref rid="pone.0214535.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>), data extraction and processing largely follow previous work [
 <xref rid="pone.0214535.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. The Climate Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5; [
 <xref rid="pone.0214535.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]) model output for this (and other) experiments has been obtained from the ESGF LLNL portal [
 <xref rid="pone.0214535.ref041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. Future forecasts use the RCP8.5 emissions scenario [
 <xref rid="pone.0214535.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. We use robust locally-weighted “lowess” regression [
 <xref rid="pone.0214535.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>] to obtain the trend model component during the calibration period, and Theil-Sen slopes [
 <xref rid="pone.0214535.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]–in the validation period. We set the “lowess” smoother span parameter to 0.8 during the smoothing. We use this span value because it appears effective at removing interdecadal variability. The smoothed model output is illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0214535.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>. Importantly, we see nonlinearities in the modeled trends. Previous variability weighting work does not account for such nonlinearities [
 <xref rid="pone.0214535.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. During the trend weighting we use smoothed output as anomalies with respect to the entire calibration period. We use normalized (by the absolute AMOC) anomalies to weight the variability models. Future projections use the “boot” variant of the method.
