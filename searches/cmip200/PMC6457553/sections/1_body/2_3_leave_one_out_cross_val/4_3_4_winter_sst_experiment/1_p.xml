 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0214535.s001" class="xref">S1 File</xref>). We select this dataset because we find considerable relationships between present-day internal variability properties and future SST change in this region and season (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0214535.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>; for model number corresponding to each model see Fig L in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0214535.s001" class="xref">S1 File</xref>). We define the East Sea as the area between 35 °N and 42°N, and between 130 °E and 139 °E. We use a simple average of all ocean points in this region. During the weighting we use the output as anomalies with respect to the calibration period. Furthermore, we use Theil-Sen slopes to obtain model output trends. Future projections use the “ar1” variant of the method, since we detect a considerable autocorrelation in the model output anomalies.
