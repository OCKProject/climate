<p class="p">Applying the new method to the real case of projecting Korean summer mean maximum temperature change by the end of this century considerably increases future projections. These projections are more informative than from the “trend” method because they use the additional variability and short-term memory (quantified by the lag-1 autocorrelation coefficient) information from both models and observations. Since the BMA predictive model is the same (
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0214535.e033" class="xref">Eq 14</xref>), the increase in skill is not due to an increased number of parameters, but is derived purely through better estimation of model weights. Recent work has found correlations with absolute values of up to approximately 0.8 between present-day interannual summer temperature sample standard deviation in global and regional climate models, and long-term future mean and/or variability changes for some regions [

 <xref rid="pone.0214535.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. This suggests that historical variability in those regions may provide a valuable constraint on the models. Applying the method to those regions should be considered for future work.
