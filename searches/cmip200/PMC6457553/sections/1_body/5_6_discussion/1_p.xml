<p class="p">Here we present a novel method “trend+var” to weight models of complex dynamical systems by their skill at representing both autocorrelated variability and trend in observations. The key step is association of two statistical models with each dynamical model: a trend statistical model, and a variability statistical model. The component submodels are weighted separately using relevant observations, and then the weights are combined. The combined weights are used to make weighted probabilistic multi-model projections. In a series of cross-validation experiments, we show that the new method appears to better identify the “true” model compared to the trend-only weighting method (“trend”). The new method also tends to perform better in terms of mean 90% posterior credible interval and mean absolute bias. Our analysis deviates in some aspects from the traditional Bayesian framework, in order to avoid making difficult-to-justify parametric assumptions about model error, and to alleviate potential overconfidence in one-at-a-time cross-validation experiments.</p>
