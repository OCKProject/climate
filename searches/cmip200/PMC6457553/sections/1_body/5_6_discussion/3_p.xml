<p class="p">It is worth discussing differences between this study and previous Bayesian work. Here we for the first time implement a quasi-Bayesian statistical method that weights models by their performance in terms of both trend, variability, and short-term memory (as quantified by the lag-1 autocorrelation) for a relatively general case: arbitrary (potentially non-linear) trend function and red noise variability. The method can be extended to more complex variability structures. Model weights are obtained by constraining the method with calibration period observations, while a parameter controlling model error assumptions is calibrated using cross-validation experiments. Some prior work does also incorporate variability into model weights [
 <xref rid="pone.0214535.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>], however their method has so far been demonstrated on a simple case: serially uncorrelated variability, and a linear mean function. Other studies [

 <xref rid="pone.0214535.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>] also incorporates variability into the analyses. However, these studies do not actually use variability performance to weight the models and ignore autocorrelation skill. Unlike previous work, we do consider autocorrelation, which is a common feature of variability in many observed and modeled processes [
