<p class="p">Here we propose a novel method to weight models of complex dynamical systems by their performance in autocorrelation, variability, and a potentially nonlinear trend (i.e., nonlinear with time) compared to observations, and to make probabilistic forecasts. The method is based on Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) [

 <xref rid="pone.0214535.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. While the framework is Bayesian, it deviates from traditional Bayesian theory in some steps of the estimation process. We highlight these deviations where they arise in more detail in later sections. Consequently, we call our approach “quasi-Bayesian”. Using several simulated and observed datasets (involving AMOC, its temperature-based index, and summer mean maximum temperature over Korea) we show that the new method results in better weighting and tends to improve forecasts of system mean change under new conditions compared to when trend-only BMA weighting is used. Thus, this work has implications for improving projections of many environmental systems. The approach is not restricted to linear trends, making it relatively easy to apply to new datasets. Finally, we apply the method to a real case problem of projecting future summer mean temperature changes over Korea.
