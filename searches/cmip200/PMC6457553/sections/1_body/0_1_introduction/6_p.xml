<p class="p">The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the novel methodology to weight models by trend and variability performance, to combine those weights, to make multi-model weighted projections, as well as the computational details. The main interest here is not the procedure for obtaining the trend and variability components, but the algorithm for model weighting. In Section 3 we describe leave-one-out cross-validation experiments to test method performance against a trend-only BMA method. Here we also provide the specific details on how the trend and variability components were extracted from the data. Section 4 describes the results of these experiments. Section 5 discusses the application of the method to make multi-model probabilistic projections of Korean summer mean maximum temperature change. Section 6 briefly discusses the main findings of the study and places it in context of prior work. Section 7 discusses the limitations of the work, and Section 8 presents conclusions.</p>
