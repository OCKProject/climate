Specifically, for some systems (stochastic dynamical systems) the stationary pdf of the equilibrium solution is directly affected by system dynamics (i.e., the nonlinear operator in the ordinary differential equations) through the Fokker-Planck (Kolmogorov forward) equation. Recent climate science work identifies variability as a key factor impacting climate projections [
