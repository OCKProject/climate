<p class="p">The best new datasets to apply the method to are the ones either with many regions, or with repeated experiments, and where a long calibration period can be split into two subperiods. In this case method performance can be systematically assessed using real observations in cross-validation experiments, and 
 <italic class="italic">f</italic> can be properly calibrated. However, any assumption about 
 <italic class="italic">f</italic> under new conditions is inherently untestable. Hence, we recommend including equal weights projections along with projections from this (or any other) weighting scheme. In the absence of many regions, and with only short time series available, one has to resort to simulated cross-validation experiments using calibration, projection, and projection reference period model output to calibrate the method. In such cases, if models share common errors, the real value of 
 <italic class="italic">f</italic> may be higher than estimated.
