<p class="p">While the focus on this paper is on the statistical weighting methodology by trend and variability performance, the simplicity of the decomposition into trend and variability (e.g., lowess method or linear detrending) deserves mention. The nonlinear trends discussed here may include residual contributions from long-term internal climate variability. However, this can be handled by the trend-weighting part of the method since this part accounts for long-term model error [
