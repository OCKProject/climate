<p class="p">We now apply both the “trend” and “trend+var” methods to make projections of Korean summer mean maximum temperature. Specifically, we use 29 GCMs from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5, [
 <xref rid="pone.0214535.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]) model runs (the same model set as for the Korea_temp experiment). The models are weighted using 1973–2005 station observational data provided by Korean Meteorological Administration (KMA) weather stations [

 <xref rid="pone.0214535.ref053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. We apply simple area average to daily mean maximum temperatures from the stations before calculating summer mean values. We use this short period because it has the best observational coverage, however to provide a liberal estimate of the uncertainty we take model error expansion factors
