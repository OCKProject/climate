<p class="p">In the next section we describe several cross-validation experiments for our method and compare the performance of the method (which we call hereafter “trend+var”) with a BMA method where all variability submodel weights are set to equal (termed hereafter “trend”). Note that “trend” method is BMA which still weights models by their performance in terms of trend.</p>
