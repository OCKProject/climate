<p class="p">At the start of the analysis, we assume that we have a collection of dynamical model time series outputs, and that these outputs can be decomposed into long-term trend and variability components. The details of this decomposition are not critical for this study, as we focus on the statistical methodology for the weighting. The weights (or probabilities) for the two submodels are calculated separately, using the Bayesian statistical paradigm, and then combined. The combined weights can then be used to make predictions (
