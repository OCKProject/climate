<p class="p">The second non-orthodox idea, is related to the deterministic 
 <italic class="italic">f</italic> factor (“error expansion factor”, 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0214535.e010" class="xref">Eq 6</xref>). This factor is a new addition to the model presented in previous work [

 </sub> to account for potential overconfidence. The non-orthodox idea relates to the procedure for selecting 
 <italic class="italic">f</italic>. Specifically, we do not estimate 
 <italic class="italic">f</italic> from present-day observations as a strict Bayesian would do, but rather we select 
 <italic class="italic">f</italic> that results in correct coverage of the 90% posterior credible intervals during cross-validation experiments (different 
 <italic class="italic">f</italic> for each dataset). The reason for this is as follows. Using just present-day observations to estimate 
 <italic class="italic">f</italic> may produce small 
 <italic class="italic">f</italic> values that result in overconfident future projections. This is because models have been developed so that they match observed data. Philosophically, present-day model-data agreement may be due to overfitting, and may not be reflective of the actual amount of error in the models.
