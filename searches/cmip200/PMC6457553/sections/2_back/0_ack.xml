 <p class="p">For their roles in producing, coordinating, and making available the CMIP5 model output, we acknowledge the climate modeling groups, the World Climate Research Programmeâ€™s (WCRP) Working Group on Coupled Modelling (WGCM), and the Global Organization for Earth System Science Portals (GO-ESSP). A portion of model outputs used here has been obtained from the German Climate Computing Centre (DKRZ), funded through the Federal Ministry for Education and Research. Jong-Soo Shin provided technical assistance with extracting Korean and East Sea temperature model output. We are thankful to Cameron Farnsworth for providing comments on the manuscript, and to Soong-Ki Kim for thought-provoking discussions.</p>
