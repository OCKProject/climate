 <sup class="sup">2</sup> September SIE) before present under the RCP8.5 scenario, and CSIRO-Mk3.6.0 as it has the highest September SIE of all models during the historical period 1979–2004, making it inconsistent with observations. We interpolate all sea ice concentration (sic) model output to a common 1° × 1° latitude-longitude grid using nearest-neighbor interpolation. Interpolating modeled sic to a common grid has been previously performed in the literature

 </sup>. To obtain GMST change to melt we use the global mean surface atmospheric temperature difference between the 5 years centered on the  year when Arctic first becomes ice-free, and the 1861–1890 preindustrial climatology for each model. These years were chosen because several models do not have data for the complete period 1850–1861. Before global averaging, we first bilinearly interpolate temperature fields to a 2° × 2° grid.
