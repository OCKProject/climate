<p id="Par50" class="p">During the observation system simulation experiments for the GMST change to melt we use each model’s output as pseudo-observations one-at-a-time. In the first set of experiments we use both SIE mean and SIE sensitivity constraints for years 1979–2017. For each perfect model, we explore the joint pdf specified in the second term of Eq. (
 <xref rid="Equ11" ref-type="" class="xref">11</xref>) using MCMC. We use 200,000 MCMC samples, with a burn-in of 50,000. We use 
 <italic class="italic">f</italic> = 3 for the observation system simulation experiments, as this results in reasonable empirical coverage of the 90% posterior credible intervals. For each excluded model we compare the posterior pdf for the GMST change to melt to the value from the true excluded model (Supplementary Figs. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref>). The GMST change from the true model, and the mean projection exhibit a considerable positive correlation, highlighting the skill of the method at projecting this quantity. We then perform a similar experiment with just the mean SIE constraint for years 1979–2004. Supplementary Figures 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">5</xref> show validation results for this case.
