<p id="Par51" class="p">We test whether the chain length and burn-in settings in the observation system simulation experiments are reasonable. Using such MCMC length in an additional estimation experiment similar to NSIDC_r91_40p.nat, we find that the differences between marginal pdfs for the GMST change in the short and the standard run are small. In addition, chains for all parameters for the short run appear to be reasonably stationary and not unduly influenced by the initial random seed. This suggests that these MCMC settings are reasonable for calibration of the 90% posterior credible interval.</p>
