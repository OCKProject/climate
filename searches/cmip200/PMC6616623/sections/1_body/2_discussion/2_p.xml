<p id="Par34" class="p">Our results, specifically Eq. (
 <xref rid="Equ7" ref-type="" class="xref">7</xref>) indicate that BMA is limited in that it considers that models are exclusive representations of reality. This point has been previously discussed in the literature

 </sup>. We show that using standard BMA can lead to biased projections in the case of a single observational constraint (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4a</xref>). In this case, the probability that more than one model is simultaneously correct is around 60% (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">7b</xref>). Yet, adding a second constraint substantially reduces this probability (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">7a</xref>). This illustrates that while the model non-exclusivity may be important, using multiple constraints may reduce its effect on model projections.
