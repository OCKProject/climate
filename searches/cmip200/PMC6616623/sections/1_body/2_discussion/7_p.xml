We use this method to make projections of the GMST change from preindustrial (1861–1890) climatology at which the Arctic will lose almost all of its September ice using 31 non-exclusive climate models. Neglecting model non-exclusivity produces biased results in case of using just a single mean sea ice extent (SIE) constraint on the models, but the effects of non-exclusivity appear to diminish when a second constraint of SIE sensitivity to temperature is added. There is a distinct probability the sea ice may vanish below 1.5 K warming limit of the Paris agreement, even if 40% of the recent sea ice decline has been naturally-caused. The projections of GMST change to melt are sensitive to the assumptions about the observational datasets, and to the natural fraction of the recent sea ice melt. The overall mean for the GMST change to melt is 2.54 K, and the 90% posterior credible interval is (1.49, 3.83) K. The study raises important questions about the usefulness of model ensembles (hypothesis sets) for making future projections. While the model runs used here were performed under RCP8.5 emissions scenario, the conclusions may hold more generally for a range of future emissions scenarios
