<p id="Par35" class="p">In the two-constraint cases, the most likely scenario is that of one and only one model (out of the 31 models in the ensemble) being adequate to represent reality. This raises a daunting question of usefulness of the model ensemble as a whole for making future projections. Should we not have restricted our sample space to a region with at least one model being adequate to represent relationship between sea ice and temperature, what would have been the probability of none of the models being adequate? To our knowledge, methods to quantify such a probability currently do not exist. Yet, determining the validity of the ensemble as a whole is fundamental from the policy-making perspective. This should become focus of future research on this topic.</p>
