<p id="Par33" class="p">The non-mathematical understanding of our method is as follows. To provide pdf of the GMST change to melt, we randomly sample all GMST changes that fall within our sample space: GMST changes that are within some distance of at least one model whose present-day mean September SIE is within some distance of the observed mean, and whose present-day SIE sensitivity is also within some distance of the observed value. In addition, we also account for the uncertainty in present-day modeled and observed SIE, as well as for the uncertainty in distances themselves. We show that such an approach is equivalent to considering all model interactions of up to order

 <italic class="italic">n</italic> is the number of models.
