 </sup>, hypotheses may be formulated for model adequacy for a particular purpose. An example hypothesis may be that a model is adequate for predicting GMST change by year 2050 relative to the preindustrial period under a particular emissions scenario within a given uncertainty. In case of hypotheses representing physical models being adequate for a particular purpose, both assumptions of independence and exclusivity are likely wrong. Consider, for example close-cousin climate models, such as IPSL-CM5A-LR and IPSL-CM5B-LR. Defining probability as degree of belief in a model being correct for a specific modeling purpose, a climate scientist may assign a higher conditional probability to IPSL-CM5A-LR if s/he were informed that its cousin IPSL-CM5B-LR is correct. This is inconsistent with independence (where a fact of one model being correct has no bearing on the conditional probability of any other model), and with exclusivity (where probability of IPSL-CM5A-LR would be zero if its cousin model was known to be correct).
