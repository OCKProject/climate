<p id="Par29" class="p">Comparing the HadISST_r51_anthro and other experiments with two constraints to the NSIDC_mean_only experiment (where only one constraint is used), it appears that the model non-exclusivity may be more important in the one-constraint case. There are less instances of high pair weights once the second constraint is introduced (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>), and the non-exclusive model probabilities appear lower (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">7</xref>). Moreover, in the NSIDC_mean_only experiment the number of MCMC samples with an exclusively one correct model is smaller than in the rest of the projection experiments. This suggests that using multiple constraints (at least in the context of introduced methodology) may provide key to reducing the impact of non-exclusivity. If this is indeed the case, then performing standard BMA using a large number of constraints may give reasonable results even without accounting for non-exclusivity. Testing this hypothesis should be the subject of future research.
