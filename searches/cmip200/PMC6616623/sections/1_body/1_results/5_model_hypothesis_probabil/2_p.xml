<p id="Par25" class="p">The model weights for HadISST_r51_anthro experiment are presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>. As it can be seen in the figure, a few models attain considerable weights, while many models receive zero or near-zero weights. The model with the highest weight (model 11, GFDL-CM3), has the mean present-day SIE of 6.43 million km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>, similar to the observed value of 6.40 million km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> used in this experiment; and the sea ice sensitivity of −2.87 million km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> K
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, similar to the observations (−3.01 million km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> K
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>). The model with the second highest weight is HadGEM2-CC, while MRI-CGCM3 has the third highest weight. We note that the weights are a diagnostic of the method, and they are not needed to obtain the pdf of the future projections. Hence, the step of finding weights can be theoretically skipped if only the projections are needed.
