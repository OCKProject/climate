<p id="Par27" class="p">A unique feature of our method is the capacity to obtain joint hypothesis probabilities for any desired hypothesis combination. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> illustrates this by showing joint weight of combinations of models 11, 18, and 20 with all other models. This triplet is chosen because of the inter-dependencies between these models (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Specifically, these models are included in the top five most dependent model pairs. A combination of (2, 11, 18, 20) gets the highest combined weight (note also that the pair 2 and 11 is the most likely pair in the ensemble), and a combination (29, 11, 18, 20) gets the second highest combined weight (the pair 29 and 11 forms the second most likely pair in the ensemble).
