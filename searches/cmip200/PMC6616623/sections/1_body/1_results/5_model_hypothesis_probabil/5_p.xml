<p id="Par28" class="p">Finally, the probability of having exclusively one model being correct is higher than the probability of more than one model being correct. Specifically, about 1,200,000 of 1,900,000 MCMC samples correspond to just one correct model (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">7a</xref>) for the HadISST_r51_anthro. Nonetheless, the amount of samples corresponding to more than one model being correct is still considerable. For the progressively increasing number of models the joint model probability tends exponentially to zero (Supplementary Fig.
