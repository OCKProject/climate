<p id="Par15" class="p">The key idea is that if sample space is appropriately defined, this approach is equivalent to adding up all models interactions in Eq. (
 <xref rid="Equ7" ref-type="" class="xref">7</xref>). We stress that this also considers all model interactions of up to order 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> (Eq. (
 <xref rid="Equ4" ref-type="" class="xref">4</xref>)). As we will show later, this approach is tractable, and can be implemented with relative ease using MCMC

 </sup>. MCMC is a method to sample from a joint distribution of parameters using Markov chains. The chain of the prediction variable A provides a way to estimate its probability density. The fraction of samples within an intersection of regions associated with any hypothesis combination naturally provides a tractable way to calculate the probability for that combination.
