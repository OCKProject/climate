 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4b</xref> illustrates the differences between the pdfs under different assumptions about the observations, and about the fraction of the recent SIE decline caused by anthropogenic effects. For example, under the assumption of a fully-anthropogenic SIE decline, the HadISST sea ice dataset, and using the 51st realization of HadCRUT4 temperature observations, the pdf is relatively tight with the most likely GMST change to melt (mode) slightly above 2 K, and the 90% credible interval of (1.44, 3.17) K (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Keeping the HadISST SIE dataset, but assuming that 40% of the recent SIE decline was natural (HadISST_r51_40p.nat) changes the pdf considerably and results in the second peak above 4 K. This suggests that determining the cause of the recent SIE decline is fundamental in reducing the uncertainty about future GMST to melt projections. Yet, keeping the natural fraction of 40%, but switching to the NSIDC ice dataset and to the 91st realization of temperature observations substantially changes the pdf once again (NSIDC_r91_40p.nat experiment). Specifically, the pdf is shifted to the left, and the second temperature peak between the 4 and 4.5 K is almost completely removed (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). This illustrates the monumental impact the uncertainties in the observations can have on future Arctic sea ice projections. These effects have been pinpointed in previous work

 </sup>. Finally, the pdf under the NSIDC sea ice observations, the 47th realization of temperature observations, and a natural fraction of the sea ice decline of 20% (NSIDC_r47_20p.nat), is again tight, with no second peak, a mean of 2.11 K, and the 90% posterior credible interval of (1.35, 2.92) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Removing the sea ice sensitivity constraint results in a wide pdf with a relatively high mean (2.90 K). In most of the experiments, the lower bound of the 90% posterior credible interval is below 1.5 K. This indicates that there is a distinct probability of the Arctic losing essentially all of its summer ice even if we fulfill commitments to the lower 1.5 K warming limit of the Paris agreement. These results are in stark contrast to an almost zero probability of Arctic ice disappearance at 1.5 K warming suggested in previous work

 </sup>. Yet, that work does not constrain the models by the sea ice sensitivity to temperature. On the other hand, our results broadly agree with a recent study that does use the sea ice sensitivity in correcting climate model biases

 </sup>. Overall, the mean GMST change to melt for all experiments accounting for non-exclusivity is 2.54 K, with the 90% posterior credible interval from 1.49 to 3.83 K (Table
