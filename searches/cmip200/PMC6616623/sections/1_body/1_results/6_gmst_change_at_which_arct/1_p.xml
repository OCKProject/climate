<p id="Par30" class="p">Our method provides pdfs for 36 parameters, however of main interest is the GMST change at which the Arctic ice will effectively melt in September. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4a</xref> explores the effect of accounting for the non-exclusivity on the GMST to melt pdfs. It appears that the effect is relatively small for the case of two constraints (HadISST_r51_anthro with and without interactions). Yet, in the NSIDC_mean_only experiment, once the interactions are accounted for, the peak in GMST change to melt between 2 and 2.5 K decreases considerably, while the upper tail of the pdf becomes much fatter. Thus, the effects of accounting for interactions diminish in the case of using two constraints on the models. This is consistent with discussion in the previous section regarding introducing multiple constraints.
