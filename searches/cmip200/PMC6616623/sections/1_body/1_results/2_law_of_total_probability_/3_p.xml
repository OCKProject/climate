 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>. In the modified BMA the probability densities of future metric A given all model pairs are subtracted, weighted by the respective pair probabilities; conditional weighted densities given model triplets are added back again, and so forth. As Eq. (
 <xref rid="Equ4" ref-type="" class="xref">4</xref>) shows, the full law considers potential model dependencies up to order

Non-exclusive model probabilities incorporate both models’ skill at capturing observations, as well as inter-model dependencies (Eq. (
 <xref rid="Equ4" ref-type="" class="xref">4</xref>)).
