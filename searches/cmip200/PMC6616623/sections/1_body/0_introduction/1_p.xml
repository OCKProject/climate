 </sup>. Ignoring the dependence is expected to disproportionately pull future probabilistic projections towards clusters of similar dependent models. In the worst-case scenario, the future projections may be centered on output from a large group of models which rely on the same erroneous code, yet little weight may be assigned to an independent correct model. This is one of the reasons Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has outright removed any probabilistic global multi-model climate projections from its Fifth Assessment Report
