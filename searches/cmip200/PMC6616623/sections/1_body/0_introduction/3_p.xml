<p id="Par5" class="p">Here, we first mathematically define model dependence and model exclusivity. Then, we present a novel statistical approach that can test multiple dependent non-exclusive statistical hypotheses, and make probabilistic projections under such hypotheses using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The new approach differs from the traditionally used Bayesian model averaging (BMA), which assumes that hypotheses are exclusive. We apply the new method to provide the first multi-model probabilistic projections of the global mean surface temperature (GMST) change from the preindustrial period at which September Arctic sea ice will effectively disappear (thereafter called GMST change to melt). The projections are based on the output of the CoupledÂ Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) models. The method considers both model dependence and skill at capturing known present-day and uncertain future sea ice metrics. GMST change to melt, along with many other statistical model parameters, is jointly estimated using MCMC. Before making actual projections, we calibrate the method in a suite of observation system simulation experiments to provide approximately correct coverage of the 90% posterior credible intervals.</p>
