  <p class="p">Joint model probabilities. 
   <bold class="bold">a</bold> HadISST_r51_anthro and 
   <bold class="bold">b</bold> NSIDC_mean_only experiments. NSIDC_mean_only experiment does not consider sea ice sensitivity to global mean surface temperature. 
   <italic class="italic">y</italic>- and 
   <italic class="italic">x</italic> axes index the first and the second climate model in the pair, while the joint probability is represented by color. The figure highlights the capability of the method to find joint probability of any pair of hypotheses in the set. There are less instances of high pair weights once the second constraint of sea ice sensitivity is introduced in the HadISST_r51_anthro experiment. This suggests that using multiple constraints may reduce the impact of hypothesis non-exclusivity
