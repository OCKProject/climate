  <p class="p">Individual CoupledÂ Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) climate model weights for the HadISST_r51_anthro experiment. The weights incorporate both model performance at capturing present-day mean September Arctic sea ice extent and its sensitivity to global mean surface temperature. The experiment assumes that recent sea ice extent decline was solely anthropogenic. This figure illustrates the capacity of the proposed method to find probabilities (weights) for any individual hypothesis in a given hypothesis set. In this case, each hypothesis is that regarding model adequacy at representing Arctic sea ice extent. Weighting is an optional component of the method; should one be interested only in prediction of a new variable given a set of hypotheses, weighting can be skipped entirely</p>
