<p class="p">To quantify drought persistence, we convert observed and modeled precipitation values into binary time series indicating dry (negative) and wet (positive) anomalies. For annual time series anomalies are computed by subtracting the linear trend (least squares estimate). For the monthly resolution, the series were first detrended using linear least squares regression. Subsequently, the long‐term mean of each month was removed from the detrended time series. Drought persistence is then measured through the dry‐to‐dry transition probability 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>
 <sub class="sub">dd</sub>, which is defined as the proportion of dry‐to‐dry transition out of all transitions from a dry status. The theoretical minimum of 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>
 <sub class="sub">dd</sub> is 0.5 by construction as this value indicates a white noise system without memory (unless there is a tendency to systematically have wetter conditions after dry conditions). In a few cases 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>
 <sub class="sub">dd</sub> values estimated from observed or simulated climate variables are slightly below the theoretical minimum, which can be explained by the sampling uncertainty. In the analyses, we consider both month‐to‐month and year‐to‐year transitions. In addition to the dry‐to‐dry transition probability 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>
 <sub class="sub">dd</sub>, also dry‐to‐wet (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>
 <sub class="sub">dw</sub>), wet‐to‐wet (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>
 <sub class="sub">ww</sub>), and wet‐to‐dry (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>
 <sub class="sub">wd</sub>) transition probabilities can be estimated from the time series. The transition probabilities are related to each other such that 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>
 <sub class="sub">dd</sub> = 1 − 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>
 <sub class="sub">dw</sub> and 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>
 <sub class="sub">ww</sub> = 1 − 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>
 <sub class="sub">wd</sub>, implying that the dynamics of the binary series can be captured by two parameters only. Under a first‐order Markov chain assumption, these transition probabilities can then be used to simulate stochastic ensembles resembling the original binary time series, which in turn can be used to generate estimates of the dry spell length distribution. The statistical simulation of a Markov chain is conducted by first taking a random initial status (either dry or wet) of which subsequent statuses are determined based on the prior status and the corresponding transition probabilities derived from the original time series. The process is repeated until the length of constructed binary time series equals the length of the original time series. To facilitate the interpretation of the persistence metric (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>
 <sub class="sub">dd</sub>), Figure 
 <xref rid="jgrd54513-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> shows how the drought length distribution depends on the value of 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>
 <sub class="sub">dd</sub>. For constructing this figure, 1,000 time steps were considered for the statistical simulation of binary time series with a constant 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>
 <sub class="sub">ww</sub> value of 0.5. For each 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>
 <sub class="sub">dd</sub> value, the statistical simulation was repeated 1,000 times and median of the simulated samples was taken as the best estimates of dry spell length distributions. Dry spell lengths at 90th of each distribution are also presented, which increase with increasing
