<p class="p">To assess whether the Markov chain model and thus also the dry‐to‐dry transition probability (

 <sub class="sub">dd</sub>) later used for model validation are reasonable approximations for observed and modeled dry spell length distributions, a two sample Kolmogorov‐Smirnov (KS) test was conducted to compare dry spell length distributions derived from the original time series to those derived from statistical simulation. For doing so, the previously described statistical simulation was repeated 1,000 times and the median of the bootstrapped distribution (black line in Figure 
 <xref rid="jgrd54513-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>b; gray shading corresponds to the range spanned by the individual simulations) compared with the observed or modeled dry spell length distributions using the KS test with a 0.05 significance level. Failure to reject the null hypothesis of equal distributions indicates that the Markov chain (and thus

 <sub class="sub">dd</sub>) is a reasonable approximation of the observed and modeled dry spell length distributions. Figure 
 <xref rid="jgrd54513-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> shows the total number of cases at which the KS test rejects the null hypothesis that observed and modeled dry spell length distributions can be approximated with a Markov chain model at the monthly time scale. For observation‐based data sets, there are no cases of rejection in most of the regions while a few grid cells located in Sahara, Northeast Brazil, and Southeast Asia have one to five cases of rejection out of five observation‐based data sets indicating that the dry spell length distribution is not well presented with Markov chain model in the respective regions. For model simulations, the spatial distribution of rejections is similar to the observation‐based estimates, with one to six cases out of 63 model simulations in the same region, which in this case confirms the reliability of the Markov chain assumption. At the annual time scale, there were no cases of rejection for model simulations and less than 10 grid cells had one to two rejections for observations (thus not shown in the figures).
