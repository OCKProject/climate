<p class="p">With the international consensus on establishing global Coupled Model Intercomparison Projects (CMIP), there have been continued phases of CMIPs since the early 2000s. The GCM simulations of the fifth phase of CMIP (CMIP5; K. E. Taylor, Stouffer, &amp; Meehl,

Here we consider historical simulations (1901–2005) and Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 simulations (2006–2010) to cover the 1901–2010 period. Only models with at least three initial condition ensemble members were included in the analysis to account for internal variability (Table
