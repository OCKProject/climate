<p class="p">To quantitatively assess the performance of the considered GCM simulations, five observation‐based global precipitation data sets were selected, all covering at least the 1901–2010 time period (Table

 <xref rid="jgrd54513-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) data are generated from interpolated station data, and each data product uses a different subset of available stations as well as different interpolation and quality control methods. In addition, we use the 20CR (20th Century Reanalysis; Compo et al., 
 <xref rid="jgrd54513-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>) and the European Centre for Medium‐Range Weather Forecasts twentieth century reanalysis (Poli et al., 
 <xref rid="jgrd54513-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>), which assimilate different variables and differ both with respect to the underlying models and assimilation schemes.
