In around 40% of the land grid cells (38.9% at monthly scale and 37.9% at annual scale) at least 80% of the model simulations agree on the negative sign of

 </sub> and for each observational data set. For all considered observational data sets the tendency of the models to underestimate drought persistence is visible, but it should be noted that 20CR has stronger drought persistence at annual scale and suggests even larger negative drought persistence biases in the climate models than when using other reference data sets. It should be noted for this result that 20CR relies on less direct observations than the other considered products (see Table 
 <xref rid="jgrd54513-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">2</xref>). The “drizzle problem,” where GCMs overestimate the number of days with light rainfall (Dai,
