 <xref rid="jgrd54513-sec-0005" ref-type="sec" class="xref">3</xref>). Subsequently, the difference between the observed and the modeled dry spell length distribution at the 95th percentile was calculated. The spatial distribution of drought length bias generally follows the pattern of the drought persistence bias in Figure 
 <xref rid="jgrd54513-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>. At monthly scale, the strongest underestimation in drought length (up to 5 months) is found in Sahara. Substantial overestimation of drought length in Arabian Peninsula and India is also noticeable. The spatial pattern at annual scale is rather homogenous over all regions. Considering the scale difference, drought length bias at annual scale is considerably smaller than monthly, unlike the larger persistence bias (Figure 
 <xref rid="jgrd54513-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>) which is related to the generally smaller values of

 <sub class="sub">dd</sub> at annual scale. Drought length biases at other percentiles are presented in Figure
