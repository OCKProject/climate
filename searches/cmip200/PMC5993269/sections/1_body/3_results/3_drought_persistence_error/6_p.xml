 <italic class="italic">E</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">omrb</italic>
 </sub> at annual scale. To compare the relative magnitude of spread against the magnitude of multisimulation mean bias, the coefficient of variation is calculated (Figures 
 <xref rid="jgrd54513-fig-0009" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9</xref>b and 
 <xref rid="jgrd54513-fig-0009" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9</xref>d). In many regions, the absolute value of the coefficient exceeds 1, which indicates that the standard deviation is larger than the mean of 
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">omrb</italic>
 </sub>. Nevertheless, pronounced underestimation can be confirmed at monthly scale, in western North America, central, and South Africa, and at annual scale, in Greenland, western South America, Tibetan Plateau, and mainland Southeast Asia, while there are only few grid cells with mean overestimation larger than the spread.
