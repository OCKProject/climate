<p class="p">As a substantial spread in the drought persistence error is found, we apply the ANOVA‐based partitioning to quantitatively assess the relative contribution from the four possible sources of uncertainty to the total spread (see section 
 <xref rid="jgrd54513-sec-0007" ref-type="sec" class="xref">3.2</xref>). Figure 
 <xref rid="jgrd54513-fig-0010" ref-type="fig" class="xref">10</xref> shows the spatial patterns determined by the relative contribution from, which are observation uncertainty, model uncertainty, and internal variability, where contribution from the statistical estimation error is only used for indicating reliability of the partitioning. Interestingly, the overall spatial patterns clearly differ depending on the considered time scale. The spread in monthly drought persistence error is mostly related to differences among the considered observational products and model uncertainty, except for high‐latitude regions. Dominant contributions from model uncertainty are especially pronounced in western North America, Amazon, Northeast Brazil, Algeria, India, and Australia. Even some regions with scarce ground measurements, for example, Sahara, Amazon, and Australia, show similar or even higher contributions from model uncertainty to the spread in

 </sub> at the monthly time scale, although a higher contribution of observation uncertainty might have been expected. In southern South America, central Africa, Arabian Peninsula, and East Asia, observation uncertainty is dominating to the total spread. Interestingly, a large spread among observation‐based data sets for monthly precipitation in North Africa and Arabian Peninsula and other low‐precipitation regions was reported in a previous study (Tanarhte et al., 
 <xref rid="jgrd54513-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). In contrast, the spread in annual drought persistence error is dominated by a combination from observation uncertainty and internal climate variability. In the Arabian Peninsula, Eastern Africa, and the Tibetan Plateau, observation uncertainty is more pronounced. Note, however, that for the annual scale, the statistical estimation error is larger than the sum of the relative contribution of all other sources of uncertainty at most locations, indicating that most of the spread (Figure 
 <xref rid="jgrd54513-fig-0009" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9</xref>c) is caused by finite sample effects.
