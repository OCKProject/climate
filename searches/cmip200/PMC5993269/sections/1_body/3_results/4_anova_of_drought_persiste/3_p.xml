<p class="p">Figure 
 <xref rid="jgrd54513-fig-0011" ref-type="fig" class="xref">11</xref> shows the global distribution of the contributions from each source to the total spread in drought persistence error. At the monthly scale, overall contribution from observational and model uncertainty is clearly larger than that from internal variability. At the annual scale, the median of the contribution from statistical estimation error is larger than any other source, implying that the partitioning is unreliable in most of the regions (Figure 
 <xref rid="jgrd54513-fig-0010" ref-type="fig" class="xref">10</xref>b). In addition, a substantially lower contribution from model uncertainty is also noticeable at the annual scale.
