<p class="p">The results of the partitioning of the spread in the drought persistence error have interesting implications both for future model validation studies and for model development. On the one hand, the analysis highlights that differences among the considered climate models are in many cases larger than the uncertainty of observations, highlighting the potential of future model development. On the other hand, the analysis also shows that issues with the considered observational data products (especially in data scarce regions) as well as finite sample effects (annual time scale) can impair the model validation exercise. Consequently, the results highlight the importance of considering the latter uncertainties in future model validation studies. Furthermore, the partitioned spread in this study might be used to assess the efficiency of model selection based on observational constraint for reducing the model spread in future projections (Cox et al.,
