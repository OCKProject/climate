<p class="p">While the considered GCMs display a systematic underestimation of drought persistence, the range of underestimation spanned by these models and by the observational data sets is substantial. To further investigate this issue, we developed an ANOVA‚Äêbased approach that allows to partition the contribution of unprecise observations, differences among climate models, internal climate variability, and statistical uncertainty to the total spread in the drought persistence error. The partitioning method applied in this study is motivated by an approach that is used to partition the uncertainty in future climate projections into model uncertainty, scenario uncertainty, and internal variability (Addor et al.,
