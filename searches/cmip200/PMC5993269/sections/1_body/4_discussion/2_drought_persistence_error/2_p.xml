<p class="p">While previous studies have highlighted the underestimation of interannual to multidecadal precipitation variability in current climate models (Ault et al.,

 <xref rid="jgrd54513-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>), we investigated here whether state‐of‐the‐art climate models capture meteorological drought persistence at shorter time scales. We find a systematic underestimation of the persistence of drought at both the monthly and annual scales in the considered CMIP5 models, when compared to five observational reference products over the 1901 to 2010 time frame. This underestimation is clear, despite the large spread in drought persistence error, which is in many regions attributable to observational uncertainty. Consequently, this study complements previous research (Ault et al., 
 <xref rid="jgrd54513-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>; Wetter et al., 
 <xref rid="jgrd54513-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) by showing that the underestimation of drought persistence already occurs if year‐to‐year or month‐to month variability is considered.
