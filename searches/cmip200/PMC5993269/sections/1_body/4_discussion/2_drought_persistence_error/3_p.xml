<p class="p">Overall, the climate models' ability to simulate precipitation variability at long time scales is likely related to the representation of tropical sea surface temperature and El Niño–Southern Oscillation variability in the GCMs, as previously suggested (Meinke et al.,

 <xref rid="jgrd54513-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Consequently, it is not unlikely that drought persistence in current climate models also depends on how well large‐scale ocean‐atmosphere variability is represented. On shorter time scales, the general underestimation of drought persistence shown in this study could possibly be attributed to issues in the representation of land‐atmosphere couplings, such as the soil moisture‐precipitation coupling at the regional scale (Guillod et al.,

Consequently, the differences in the spatial distribution of the drought persistence error at monthly and annual time scales identified in this study might be related to differences in the governing processes. However, to which degree this is the case and how errors on short time scales (e.g., day to day) translate to errors on long time scales (e.g., year to year) remains to be investigated.
