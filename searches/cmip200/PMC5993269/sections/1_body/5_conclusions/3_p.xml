<p class="p">To investigate the substantial spread in the drought persistence error, we develop a new methodology to effectively partition the spread into its main components, which include (i) observation uncertainty, (ii) model uncertainty, (iii) internal variability, and (iv) statistical estimation error of the considered validation metric. At the monthly time scale, observation uncertainty (which is often neglected in model validation studies) and model uncertainty are the main contributors to the total spread. At annual time scales, the statistical estimation error is dominant in most regions, followed by combined contributions from internal variability and observational uncertainty. This analysis reveals regions where improvements of GCMs or model selection can substantially reduce the spread of model uncertainty. Reducing uncertainty of drought simulations is important for improving drought projections in a changing climate.</p>
