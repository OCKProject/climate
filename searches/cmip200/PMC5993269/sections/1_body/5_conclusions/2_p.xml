<p class="p">Persistent meteorological drought triggers subsequent drying of other hydrological variables on land (Van Loon, 
 <xref rid="jgrd54513-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) such as soil moisture or water storage, which can, for example, have strong impacts on vegetation (Nicolai‐Shaw et al., 
 <xref rid="jgrd54513-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>) and regional temperature (Seneviratne et al., 
 <xref rid="jgrd54513-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). In this study, we investigated how well current generation GCMs represent drought persistence over the twentieth century and the recent past. For doing so we focused on meteorological drought and compared dry‐to‐dry transition probabilities (

Overall, the results highlight that the considered models tend to underestimate drought persistence at monthly and annual time scales. This is an interesting addition to previous results (Ault et al., 
 <xref rid="jgrd54513-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>; Kumar et al., 
 <xref rid="jgrd54513-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>), which indicate that CMIP5 models underestimate the risk of prolonged droughts on multidecadal time scales.
