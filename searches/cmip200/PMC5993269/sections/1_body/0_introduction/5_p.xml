<p class="p">In this study, we aim to investigate the ability of GCMs to simulate drought persistence, measured through the dry‐to‐dry transition probability (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>
 <sub class="sub">dd</sub>) in a Markov chain framework. Currently, a number of drought indicators are used in the scientific literature. Typically, these indices are tailored to specific types of analysis and are often categorized into meteorological (Keyantash &amp; Dracup, 
 <xref rid="jgrd54513-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>) hydrological (Tallaksen &amp; van Lanen, 
 <xref rid="jgrd54513-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>), or agricultural drought (Quiring &amp; Papakryiakou, 
 <xref rid="jgrd54513-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>). In addition, indicators like the Standardized Precipitation Index (McKee et al., 
 <xref rid="jgrd54513-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1993</xref>) or the Standardized Precipitation and Evapotranspiration Index (Vicente‐Serrano et al., 
 <xref rid="jgrd54513-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>) depend on the choice of a model distribution which in turn needs to be calibrated and is subject to uncertainty (Stagge et al., 
 <xref rid="jgrd54513-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Finally, the choice of threshold to discriminate droughts from nondrought events is highly contextual and sometimes even subjective (Steinemann, 
 <xref rid="jgrd54513-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Consequently, there is no single unifying drought definition, and the choice of drought indicator is usually dependent on the scope of individual assessments. Here we use precipitation anomalies as a drought indicator to separate dry (negative anomalies) from wet spells, which form the basis for estimating 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>
 <sub class="sub">dd</sub>. The rationale underlying this decision is that precipitation is one of the climate variables that has been monitored with the best spatial and temporal coverage throughout the past century, and few additional assumptions are required (see section 
 <xref rid="jgrd54513-sec-0005" ref-type="sec" class="xref">3</xref>). In order to robustly assess the representation of 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>
 <sub class="sub">dd</sub> in the models and to fully characterize the spread of the model error, we compare multiple observation‐based data sets with a large ensemble of GCMs runs. Finally, we assess to which degree the spread in drought persistence error can be attributed to differences among models, observation uncertainty, internal variability, and the statistical estimation error of 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>
 <sub class="sub">dd</sub> using an analysis of variance (ANOVA)‐based approach. We close with a discussion on the link between the drought persistence error identified in this study to the issues found in precipitation variability and suggest potential implication of using the error partitioning method introduced in this study for the interpretation of climate model projections.
