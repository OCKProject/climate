<p class="p">Measures of persistence (or memory) of drought events and related climate phenomena have been used to analyze drought variability in both models and observations. Commonly used measures include power spectra of the time series (Ault et al.,

 <xref rid="jgrd54513-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1997</xref>) or the Hurst exponent (Mandelbrot &amp; Wallis, 
 <xref rid="jgrd54513-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1969</xref>) which have been used, for example, to measure long‐term persistence in time series of drought indices (Tatli, 
 <xref rid="jgrd54513-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) or precipitation (Bunde et al., 
 <xref rid="jgrd54513-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>; Kumar et al., 
 <xref rid="jgrd54513-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). By transforming continuous time series of drought indicators into categorical time series of dry and wet spells, the persistence of drought can be effectively estimated through the parameters of a binary first‐order Markov chain model (Sericola, 
 <xref rid="jgrd54513-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). In this case the dry‐to‐dry transition probability (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>
 <sub class="sub">dd</sub>) is used as a measure of drought persistence (Jackson, 
 <xref rid="jgrd54513-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1975</xref>; Sharma &amp; Panu, 
 <xref rid="jgrd54513-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>; Wilby et al., 
 <xref rid="jgrd54513-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). The primary assumption for this measure is that the probability of drought and nondrought events is conditional only upon the previous time step. Interestingly, the dry spell length distribution can also be approximated by the geometric distribution given the assumption that the dry spell lengths that are estimated are binary sequences of independent trial results (in this case, drought and nondrought), and the probability of success (in this case, probability of drought) is equal for all the trials (Lee et al., 
 <xref rid="jgrd54513-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1986</xref>; Mathier et al., 
 <xref rid="jgrd54513-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1992</xref>).
