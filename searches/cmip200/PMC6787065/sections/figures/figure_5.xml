  <p class="p">Scenarios of Fe supply to the tropical Pacific. In the low iron scenario, analogous to the modern climate, N
   <sub class="sub">2</sub> fixation (yellow zone and dots) is concentrated in the Northwest and Southwest subtropical Pacific where aeolian dust deposition is greatest. Non-limiting PO
   <sub class="sub">4</sub> concentrations (green zone and dots) exist within the tropics and spread laterally from the area of upwelling near the Americas and at the equator (blue zone). In the high Fe scenario, analogous to the glacial climate, N
   <sub class="sub">2</sub> fixation couples to the upwelling zones in the east Pacific, enabling strong utilisation of PO
   <sub class="sub">4</sub>, the vertical expansion of suboxic zones (grey bubbles) and a deeper injection of carbon-enriched organic matter (downward squiggly arrows)
