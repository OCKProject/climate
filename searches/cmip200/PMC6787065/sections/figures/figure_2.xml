   <sub class="sub">2</sub> was made responsive to oceanic uptake and release of C by the ocean (see methods). Coloured edges of markers correspond to ocean states as described in the figure legend. Star markers represent oceans with carbon cycles equilibrated to the modern Fe deposition

   </sup>, which represents a global integrated increase of 500% over the modern supply but is regionally variable (Supplementary Fig. 
   <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>). Triangles represent changes in the half-saturation constant for Fe limitation of N
   <sub class="sub">2</sub> fixers, emulating changes in Fe supply to only N
   <sub class="sub">2</sub> fixers. Note the diminishing gains in CO
   <sub class="sub">2</sub> drawdown between 500 and 2500% iron deposition scenarios, consistent with Fe-saturation and PO

   <sub class="sub">2</sub> fixation and atmospheric CO
   <sub class="sub">2</sub>, with a multi-ocean mean of 0.58 ± 0.03 ppm CO
