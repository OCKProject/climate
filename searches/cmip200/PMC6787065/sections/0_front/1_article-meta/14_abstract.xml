 <p id="Par2" class="p">Iron fertilisation of the high latitude oceans is a well-established biological mechanism to explain the ice age drawdown of atmospheric CO
  <sub class="sub">2</sub>, yet modelling has so far struggled to account for a sufficient drawdown via this mechanism. Here, the authors propose that N
  <sub class="sub">2</sub> fixers, which inhabit the lower latitude ocean, made a significant contribution to CO
  <sub class="sub">2</sub> drawdown and so amplified the global response to iron fertilisation during ice ages.
