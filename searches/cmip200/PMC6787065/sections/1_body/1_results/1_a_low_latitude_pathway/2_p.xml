<p id="Par8" class="p">The glacial aeolian Fe supply increased the global rate of N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fixation by 26 Tg N yr
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and caused a large-scale change in its distribution (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref>). Dinitrogen fixers exhibited a closer coupling to regions of strong upwelling in the tropics (solid contour in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref>) that are co-located with areas of denitrification (dots in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref>). The greatest changes were observed in the Pacific. Dinitrogen fixation decreased in the Northwest Pacific and increased in the Eastern Tropical Pacific, which hosted low rates of N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fixation under modern Fe supply (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">5a</xref>). As a result, surface PO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> was reduced throughout the tropical Pacific by between 0.1 and 0.2 mmol m
 <sup class="sup">−3</sup> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b</xref>; Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">5b</xref>). Pacific PO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> utilisation increased the C:P ratio of exported organic matter by an average of ~14 units (contours in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b</xref>), which elevated local C export (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1c</xref>; Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">5c</xref>), caused a vertical expansion of suboxia (dots in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1c</xref>), and enabled the permanent accumulation of 244 Pg of respired C in the eastern Pacific (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1d</xref>; Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">5d</xref>). As a result, 11.6 ppm of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> was permanently sequestered (see “Quantifying CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> drawdown” and Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>).
