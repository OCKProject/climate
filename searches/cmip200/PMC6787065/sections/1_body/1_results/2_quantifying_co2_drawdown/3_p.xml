<p id="Par12" class="p">An increase in Fe supply drew between 6.7 and 16 ppm of atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> into the ocean (compare star and plus symbols in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Different ocean states (colours in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>) therefore absorbed different quantities of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. However, all states developed a positive, linear relationship between N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fixation and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> drawdown (coloured lines in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). A consistent relationship between N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fixation and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> drawdown suggested that all states absorbed atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> via the same low latitude pathway described in previously. Approximately 0.58 ± 0.03 ppm of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> was absorbed by the ocean for every additional Teragram of N fixed per year (Tg N yr
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>). The linear relationship was generated as N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fixation responded to variations in Fe supply (circles) and as N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fixation was made more or less sensitive to the modern supply of Fe (triangles). Similar responses occurred via both methods (altered Fe deposition and Fe requirements) and strongly implicated N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fixation as the driver of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> drawdown.
