<p id="Par13" class="p">The sensitivity of each ocean state to changes in N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fixation was fundamentally linked to the strength of equatorial upwelling. The greatest sensitivity was found in GFDL
 <sup class="sup">
  <italic class="italic">warm</italic>
 </sup>, which featured strong upwelling, and therefore high surface PO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> and large suboxic zones (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Consequently, large regions of the tropical ocean were low in NO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>:PO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>, which enabled large gains in N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fixation (88 Tg N yr
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> drawdown (43 ppm) as Fe supply increased from 50 to 2500% of its modern rate. In contrast, Mk3L
 <sup class="sup">
  <italic class="italic">cold</italic>
 </sup> featured the weakest rates of upwelling, lowest surface concentrations of PO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>, the smallest suboxic zones (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>), and thus the weakest sensitivity. Phosphate availability therefore emerged as the ultimate control on biological CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> drawdown by setting N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fixation potential, while Fe supply modulated the extent to which this potential was realised.
