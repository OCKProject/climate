 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fixers without varying aeolian Fe deposition (See methods), which emulated variations in Fe supply but only to N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fixers. If similar changes occurred via both methods, then N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fixation could be considered the primary driver of CO
