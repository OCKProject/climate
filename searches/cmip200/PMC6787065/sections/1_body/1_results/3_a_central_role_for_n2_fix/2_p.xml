<p id="Par15" class="p">These experiments revealed that N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fixers were essential for C accumulation via the low latitudes. If N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fixers were removed and the NO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> reservoir remained constant, greater Fe supply did not cause respired C storage (ones in Fig.
