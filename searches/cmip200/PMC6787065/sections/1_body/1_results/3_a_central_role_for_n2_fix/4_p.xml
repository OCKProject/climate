<p id="Par17" class="p">The linear relationship between N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fixation and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> drawdown, which was robust across different ocean states (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>), was therefore built on two phases. The first phase (green-yellow shading in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b</xref>) occurred in a NO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>-limited ocean, where N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fixation increased the supply of NO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> to surface communities and thereby allowed excess PO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> to be consumed. The second phase (light blue shading in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b</xref>) occurred in a PO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>-limited ocean. As N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fixers consumed proportionally more of the remaining PO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>, their C export became more important for overall C export (compare ones, threes and fours/fives Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b</xref>). The slope of the linear relationship presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>, therefore, rested on a C:P ratio of N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fixer organic matter equal to 331:1
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">39</xref>
 </sup>. While there is significant variation around this number, under PO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>-limiting conditions the C:P ratio tends to increase, exceeding 500:1 among 
 <italic class="italic">Trichodesmium</italic> species
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">28</xref>
 </sup>. Therefore, the C:P of N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fixers could rise as PO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>-limiting conditions develop and steepen the linear relationship to enable greater CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> drawdown above that suggested here.
