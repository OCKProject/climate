<p id="Par16" class="p">Dinitrogen fixers were therefore essential for oceanic C storage for the simple reason that they supplied fixed N to the upper ocean. Fixed N supply was responsible for 70% of the C gains (~5–11 ppm) and responsible for the increase in PO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> utilisation as Fe supply increased (compare ones and twos in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a</xref>). Included within this C storage was the increase in C:P ratios of Pacific Ocean phytoplankton as PO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> concentrations declined (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b</xref>). The final 30% (~2–5 ppm CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) of additional C gain was mostly due to export of N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fixer’s C-rich organic matter as the ocean became PO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>-limited (compare ones, threes and fives in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a</xref>), while their efficient utilisation of PO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> provided a small benefit to oceanic C storage (compare fours and fives in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a</xref>). As N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fixers already inhabit a niche of low NO

 </sup>, they are already at a competitive advantage over non-N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fixing phytoplankton for available PO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>.
