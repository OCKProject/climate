<p id="Par4" class="p">There are good reasons to accommodate the lower latitudes in our search for additional mechanisms. First, the region is enormous. Surface waters between 40°S and 40°N represent over two thirds of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> outgassing to the atmosphere
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">8</xref>
 </sup> and more than half of global C export
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>
 </sup>. Second, unconsumed phosphate (PO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>) at concentrations in excess of 0.1 to 0.2 mmol m
 <sup class="sup">−3</sup> exists in surface waters across the tropics, which is evidence for unrealised biological CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fixation. Third, tropical oceans produce organic matter that is enriched in C because tropical phytoplankton are adapted to fix more C per unit phosphorus (P) under P scarcity
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>
 </sup>. Fourth, oxygen-deficient waters in the tropical Pacific, Indian and Atlantic allow organic matter to sink deeper into the ocean interior
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">12</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>
 </sup>. If these mechanisms are combined, the co-occurrence of more complete PO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> utilisation and the production of C-enriched organic matter near to oxygen-deficient zones would constitute an effective pathway of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> drawdown.
