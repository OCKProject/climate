<p id="Par25" class="p">New evidence questions a glacial deceleration of the N cycle in the Eastern Tropical Pacific. Recent work has revealed a vertical expansion of Pacific suboxic zones

 </sup>, a feature reproduced by our Fe fertilisation simulations. While it is not well known whether sedimentary or water column denitrification is more sensitive to increases in suboxia, it seems unlikely that both would decrease as suboxic zones expanded. In fact, it seems more likely that sedimentary denitrification was stimulated as waters overlying the sediment became deoxygenated

 </sup> and as more organic carbon was buried within sediments
