<p id="Par46" class="p">For those experiments with a freely evolving atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration (within section “Quantifying CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> drawdown”), we initialised each with the near-equilibrium solution produced by holding atmospheric 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> at 280 ppm and with the modern Fe deposition (stars in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>), such that experiments with modern Fe deposition maintained atmospheric 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> near to 280 ppm. Altering Fe deposition then caused changes in air-sea CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> exchange that altered the atmospheric and oceanic C reservoirs. The atmospheric C reservoir was calculated assuming a constant atmospheric weight of 5.1 × 10
