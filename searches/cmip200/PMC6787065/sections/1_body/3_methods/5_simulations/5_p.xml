Areas of connection between the deep and surface ocean, such as the high latitudes and deep upwelling zones, were therefore either non-Fe limited or almost non-Fe limited. This parameterisation rendered the high latitudes insensitive to greater Fe supply, while stratified lower latitudes were sensitive to Fe supply but NO
