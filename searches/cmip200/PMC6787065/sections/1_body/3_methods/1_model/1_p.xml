<p id="Par28" class="p">Model simulations were performed using the ocean component of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) Mark 3L—Carbon of the Ocean, Atmosphere and Land (Mk3L-COAL) Earth system model. The ocean component is comprised of an ocean general circulation model (OGCM) described in Phipps et al.
