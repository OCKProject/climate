  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>
 </sup>. These equations allow the general phytoplankton group to represent variations in the biogeochemical properties of the marine ecosystem, which has positive effects on the simulation of global ocean biogeochemistry, particularly the N cycle. Meanwhile, N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fixers and calcifiers follow more static equations. N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fixers have fixed nutrient limitation functions and stoichiometry based on laboratory studies, but are also remineralised according to community composition. Remineralisation of both forms of organic matter is also conserved and passed to deeper grid boxes if oxygen is not sufficient. The calcifying group, which only interacts with DIC and ALK species, produces particulate inorganic carbon at 8% of the rate at which the general phytoplankton group produces organic carbon. Its remineralisation rate is also fixed according to an 
 <italic class="italic">e</italic>-folding depth-dependent decay, which transfers a large fraction of particulate inorganic carbon to the deep ocean.
