<p id="Par19" class="p">The proposed methodology is generalized and can be applied to different locations. Here, we use daily average temperatures for Atlanta (33.7490°N, 84.3880°W), Chicago (41.8781°N, 87.6298°W), Denver (39.7392°N, 104.9903°W), Houston (29.7604°N, 95.3698°W), Los Angeles (34.0522°N, 118.2437°W), and Phoenix (33.4484°N, 112.0740°W) from the Climate Prediction Center (CPC) global air temperature dataset provided by NOAA/OAR/ESRL PSD, Boulder, Colorado, USA (

This dataset includes near surface air temperature with a 0.5 degree spatial resolution and daily temporal resolution. We interpret observed temperature data from the grid encompassing each city to be representative of that particular city.
