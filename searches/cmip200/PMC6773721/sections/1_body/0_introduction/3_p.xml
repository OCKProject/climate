<p id="Par4" class="p">In this paper, we propose a heat wave intensity-duration-frequency (HIDF) model. This model differs from the typical definition of heat waves, as we model the annual occurrence probability of consecutive hot days. We define HIDF to be similar to traditional precipitation IDF curves, obtaining the occurrence probability (or the corresponding return period) of annual maximum temperatures over durations between one to ten days. We use multivariate copula functions to link heat wave durations and intensities. The use of these functions allows for presentation of heat wave frequency information with different combinations of intensity and severity. Copulas have been used for linking different features of drought and precipitation extremes such as duration and severity

 </sup>. In this paper, we consider heat wave intensity as the average of mean daily temperature throughout the duration of heat wave. We use mean temperatures (instead of maximum temperature) is to account for night-time cooling (or lack of it), since the cumulative impacts of high temperatures (e.g. the lack of night-time cooling during a heat wave) can be detrimental to human health. Our results portray and compare HIDF curves for six cities in the United States, using daily mean temperature data from 1979–2016. We also compare HIDF curves generated from historical model simulations (including anthropogenic emissions) against natural-only historical (e.g., pre-industrial emissions level) model simulations to investigate the impacts of anthropogenic emissions on extreme heat events, using daily mean temperature data from 1850–2005. Using this approach, we concurrently compare the differences in heat wave intensity, duration, and frequency for a more comprehensive analysis of anthropogenic climate change impacts on heat waves.
