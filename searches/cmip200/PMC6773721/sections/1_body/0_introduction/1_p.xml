 </sup>. In addition, heat waves have been connected to the increased risk of forest fires

 </sup>. For example, the 2003 European heat wave and 2010 Russian heat wave killed over 70,000 and 56,000 people, respectively

 </sup>. The 2003 European heat wave also caused electricity demand to soar and energy efficiency to plummet
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>
 </sup>. France, Europe’s main electricity exporter, was forced to cut power exports by more than half during the heat wave, because power plants were operating at significantly reduced capacity

 </sup>. Extreme temperatures and heat wave events have also caused problems in the transportation sector. Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport was forced to cancel nearly 50 flights due to extreme temperatures in the summer of 2017, when temperatures soared as high as 120 °F. These cancellations produced a domino effect on the entire air transportation system, which demonstrate how impacts of regional heat waves can expand to a national or even global level.
