 </sup>. The impacts of individual heat wave characteristics can be amplified when considered concurrently (e.g. high intensity and long duration vs high intensity and short duration heat wave events). The significant impacts along with the increasing intensity and duration of extreme heat wave events highlight the need for a comprehensive metric, accounting for all heat wave characteristics simultaneously.
