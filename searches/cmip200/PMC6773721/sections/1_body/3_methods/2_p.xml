<p id="Par12" class="p">In other words, we first determine the average temperature of the one to ten hottest consecutive days in each year to model HIDF curves. We then use multivariate copula functions to find the non-exceedance (or exceedance) joint probability cumulative distribution function of heat wave duration and intensity

 </sup>. We first determine the admissible models via suitable Goodness-of-Fit tests, at 0.05 significance level, out of the 25 copula families and the 17 distributions built into the Multivariate Copula Analysis Toolbox. Then, we choose the best fitting (admissible) model based on the Bayesian Information Criterion

 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref> shows a summary of the selected marginal distributions, best-fitted copula families, and their performance in terms of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE). We acknowledge that duration cannot be considered as a pure random variable which may affect the results. Given that the marginal distribution for duration is a non-continuous function, we added a small random noise; i.e. Gaussian distributed perturbations centered on the data with a standard deviation of 0.05

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref>–
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S11</xref> show that there is no significant change in the multivariate cumulative distribution function when adding noise to heat wave duration (continuous function) as compared to the original discrete distribution. Another method to transform the marginal cumulative distribution into a continuous function is to add uniform perturbations centered on the data along (−0.5, 0.5)
