  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">48</xref>
 </sup>, first outlined in
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" class="xref">59</xref>
 </sup>, and mathematically formalized in
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" class="xref">60</xref>
 </sup>. This formulation is also known as the OR hazard scenarios in which either duration or intensity exceed their corresponding thresholds.
