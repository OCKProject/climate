<p id="Par9" class="p">Global warming is causing an increase in the frequency and severity of heat wave events, which increases the importance of using a robust model in understanding heat waves and quantifying heat wave properties. We propose a multivariate approach to construct heat wave intensity, duration, frequency (HIDF) curves, which enables robust frequency (hazard) analysis of extreme heat events, while concurrently accounting for both intensity and duration of heat waves. Since these heat wave features are interdependent, it is important to model the relationship in a manner that avoids biases in the frequency analyses. The main objective of this paper is to present the HIDF methodology and show different types of applications including describing heat wave features and conducting attribution analyses. An attribution analysis using the proposed HIDF curves shows that the anthropogenic emissions have increased the likelihood of a four-day heat wave (temperature &gt; 31 °C) by 24%. We further show a six-day heat wave (temperature &gt; 31 °C) has a 29% higher likelihood under the anthropogenic emission scenario relative to the natural-only scenario. The proposed method is general and can be applied to different locations and different combinations for heat wave durations and intensities.</p>
