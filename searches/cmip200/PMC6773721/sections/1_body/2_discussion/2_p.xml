<p id="Par10" class="p">The HIDF curve can potentially be used by for design of infrastructure systems such as electric grids and power plants. For example, an electric grid is designed for peak demand and must consider both the duration and intensity of heat wave events simultaneously, similar to the use of precipitation IDF curves for highway culvert design. Although analyzing heat waves with univariate indices have provided useful information in the past, our proposed metric can change how we view the extremeness of a heat wave event moving forward.</p>
