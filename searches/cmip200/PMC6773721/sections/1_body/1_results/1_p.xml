 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> shows the heat wave IDF curves for Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, and Phoenix. Each subplot depicts the joint non-exceedance probabilities for different combinations of heat wave duration and intensity. In addition to providing heat wave hazard (frequency) information, HIDF curves can be used for comparing the hazard of heat waves in different locations. For example, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> portrays that Chicago heat waves with durations of up to six-days and average temperatures of 38 °C or less correspond to a 2-year return period (probability = 0.5), while a similar six-day heat wave with a 2-year return period in Phoenix would have a much higher intensity of 47.5 °C (see the OR hazard scenario entailed by Eq. 
 <xref rid="Equ3" ref-type="" class="xref">3</xref>, and the related references concerning the calculation of multivariate return periods). Similar comparisons can be made based on the duration or frequency of events in different regions. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> demonstrates the flexibility of the proposed HIDF curves for describing the probability of occurrence of different combinations of heat wave duration and intensity. The figure also shows different combinations of heat wave duration and intensity that lead to the same return period. For example, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> shows that a 7-day heat wave with an intensity of 47 °C is equally likely as a 10-day heat wave with an intensity of 45 °C (here, both are 2.5 year events) in Phoenix, AZ. As mentioned in the Methods Section, the HIDF can be described based on the concept of joint exceedance probabilities (instead of non-exceedance probabilities) for different combinations of heat wave intensity and duration (Eq. 
 <xref rid="Equ4" ref-type="" class="xref">4</xref>). Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> shows an example of HIDF based on the joint exceedance probabilities for the city of Chicago. The figure shows that joint exceedance probabilities of a heat wave event lasting six days or more with an average temperature exceeding 38 °C in Chicago has a return period greater than 100 years (less than 0.01 exceedance probability).
