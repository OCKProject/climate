<p id="Par7" class="p">In addition to describing characteristics of heat waves in different locations, the HIDF can be used to investigate how heat wave features have changed over time, or in response to other factors (e.g., anthropogenic emissions). Here we employ HIDF curves to attribute changes in heat wave intensity, duration, and frequency to anthropogenic emissions. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> compares HIDF curves in Los Angeles, CA using the mean of the historical (black) and natural-only (red) CMIP5 simulations. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> shows differences in the joint non-exceedance probability of heat wave duration and intensity between historical and natural-only simulations (1950–2005). This figure demonstrates that heat wave events are generally shorter and less intense under the natural-only forcing (without anthropogenic emissions) in relation to the historical forcing (with anthropogenic emissions). In other words, a heat wave with the same intensity and duration under natural-only historical conditions has a lower frequency (and probability of occurrence) than a heat wave occurring under historical conditions perturbed by anthropogenic emissions. For example, this figure shows that an extreme ten-year, ten-day heat wave event have an intensity of 31.9 °C under natural-only conditions, while the event would have an intensity of 32.2 °C under historical conditions. This is a statistically significant difference at 0.05 significance level (see Supplementary Materials). Mazdiyasni 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 2017 show that an increase of only 0.5 °C in summer mean temperatures leads to a 146% increase in the probability of mass mortality events in India. The study also shows that an increase of heat wave days from six to eight days over the summer season leads to an 84% increase in the probability of mass mortality events. We can infer than the effects of a rise of 0.3 °C in a 10-year heat wave event over 10 consecutive days will have significant implications on human health, agriculture, the environment, and the electric grid
