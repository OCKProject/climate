 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> presents a HIDF analysis based on joint exceedance probabilities (i.e., both intensity and duration being above their thresholds). HIDF curves displaying exceedance probabilities for different cities as well as CMIP5 historical and natural-only model simulations are presented in Supplementary Materials (Figs
