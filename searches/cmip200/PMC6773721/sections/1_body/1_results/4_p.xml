<p id="Par8" class="p">Given that the HIDF curve is based on a multivariate framework, we can extract information about one variable (e.g., heat wave intensity) conditioned on a second variable (e.g., heat wave duration) – Eq. 
 <xref rid="Equ5" ref-type="" class="xref">5</xref>. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>, for example, displays the difference in heat wave intensity given heat wave duration between historical vs natural-only conditions, using the mean of the four CMIP5 models (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref> shows similar results for each individual CMIP5 model). We show that the probability of heat wave intensity being greater than 30 °C given a duration of four days is eight percent greater under historical conditions in comparison to natural-only conditions (81% vs 75%). We also show that the probability of intensity being greater than 31 °C given a heat wave duration of four days is 24 percent greater under historical conditions vs natural-only conditions (41% vs 33%, respectively). Note that we are considering relative percent change with respect to natural-only conditions. These increases in the probability of intense heat over several consecutive days can be attributed to anthropogenic warming. Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref> also shows similar results for six-day heat waves. As shown, anthropogenic warming has increased the likelihood of a six-day heat wave (temperature &gt; 30 °C) by 10% and a six-day heat wave (temperature &gt; 31 °C) by 29%. Figures 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref> imply greater increases in the likelihood of longer and more intense heat waves in the historical simulations relative to the natural-only. Therefore, we can conclude that greater increases in the likelihood of extreme (in intensity and duration) heat wave events may have been driven by anthropogenic warming.
