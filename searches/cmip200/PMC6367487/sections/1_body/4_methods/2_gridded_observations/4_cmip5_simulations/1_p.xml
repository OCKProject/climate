<p id="Par36" class="p">We focused on so-called AMIP simulations (historical land-atmosphere simulations with prescribed sea surface temperatures over 1979–2008) of the CMIP5 project and selected 20 models providing the following three output variables: 1) TAS: 2-m near surface air temperature (in K); 2) Pr: total precipitation (in kg m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> s
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>); 3) mrsos: moisture in upper portion of soil column (10 cm; in kg/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>). It is often argued that SM variability varies with soil depth
