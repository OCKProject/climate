<p id="Par42" class="p">Next, the normalized data produced in the previous steps were averaged considering only summer (JJA months) for the remotely sensed SM retrievals and the CMIP5 SM simulations. Note that the mean of the normalized data is non-zero because M is calculated using all months (and spatially averaged) while the normalized data is computed only over JJA (and not over the full year). Finally, the difference in the overall mean of the normalized data between the CMIP5 models simulations and the remotely sensed SM products (SMOS-IC and CCI) was computed.</p>
