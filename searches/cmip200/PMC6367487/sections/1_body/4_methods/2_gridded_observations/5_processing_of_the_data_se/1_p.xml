 </sup>. The period used for this analysis is 1978–2008 for all datasets with the exception of the SMOS dataset which is only available from 2010 to 2016. By using SMOS in this comparison, we are making an implicit assumption of first-order stationarity in the SM time series (i.e., the mean in 2010–2016 should match the mean in 1979–2008). Since mid-latitudinal summer drying is a common climate change signal predicted by climate models, we examined if this assumption could lead to misleading conclusions. This was done by using CCI data over different periods: 1978–2008, 1987–2008, 2010–2016 (used period for SMOS) and confirming that resulting SM biases were consistent across these three periods (not shown here). Pixels with percentage of forest &gt;60%, strong topography, or frozen soil conditions were excluded from the analyses.
