 <italic class="italic">in situ</italic> station was independently collocated to the closest grid points of SMOS and CCI based on its longitude and latitude coordinates and the corresponding CCI and SMOS SM retrievals were compared to the ARM time series on a daily basis within the period 2010–2017. Then the statistics of the inter-comparison were computed based on results obtained over each single pixel for both SMOS and CCI. The resulting, Pearson correlation, and normalized Root-Mean-Square Error and standard deviation, are summarized in a Taylor diagram

 </sup> (see Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S11</xref>), showing that SMOS and CCI share fair and comparable performance with respect to the overall ARM dataset: most correlation values range between 0.6 and 0.8, and standard deviations tend to be overestimated. This error may be due to differences in sampling depth between 
 <italic class="italic">in situ</italic> measurements and remote sensing products), but it is reduced by the normalization procedure aimed at enhancing SM comparability between remote sensing and climate models (details below).
