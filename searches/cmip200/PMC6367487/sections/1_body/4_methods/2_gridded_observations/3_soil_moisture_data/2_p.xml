 </sup>. SMOS-IC SM was recently developed by INRA (Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique) in collaboration with CESBIO (Centre d’Etudes Spatiales de la BIOsphère). The SMOS-IC SM product differs from the operational SMOS Level 3 SM product (SMOSL3) in three main ways: (i) SMOS-IC is based on SMOS Level 3 TB data and it is independent from auxiliary model products, (ii) specific filters were introduced to select the TB data used in the SM retrievals, and (iii) a new calibration of the soil roughness parameters and vegetation parameters was applied in the forward L-MEB (L-band Microwave Emission of the Biosphere) model. SMOS-IC provides SM (in m

   <p id="Par33" class="p">The ESA CCI combined (version 03.2) SM product was generated by combining different active and passive microwave SM retrievals from different sensors: ERS, ASCAT (Metop-A and Metop-B), SSMR, TMI, AMSR-E, SSM/I, SMOS, AMSR2, and WindSat

    </sup>. It should be noted that this CCI version included more recent sensors (e.g., SMOS and AMSR2) that were not considered in the previous versions of the CCI SM products. Hence, a significant increase in the scientific value of the products is expected. It is worth noting that the SMOS SM product included in the CCI was derived using the LPRM algorithm which is different from the SMOS-IC products used in this study. The CCI SM product is provided as daily SM (in m
    <sup class="sup">3</sup>/m
    <sup class="sup">3</sup>) for the first 5 cm of the soil column and is available for the 1978–2015 period with a spatial resolution of 0.25° × 0.25°.
