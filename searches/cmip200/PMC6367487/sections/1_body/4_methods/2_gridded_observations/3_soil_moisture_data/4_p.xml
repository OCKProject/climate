<p id="Par35" class="p">It should be noted that there are some uncertainties in remote sensing retrieved SM originating from the sensor type, scales, calibration, the observation geometry, parameters/auxiliary fields used in the SM inversion algorithms, sampling depth mismatch between models and satellite-based SM retrievals, and/or uncertainties introduced by underlying assumptions, which should not be neglected when applying remote sensing observations in model evaluation.</p>
