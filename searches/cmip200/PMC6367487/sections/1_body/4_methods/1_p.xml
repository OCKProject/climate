<p id="Par24" class="p">In this study, we compared climate model outputs for 2-m near surface air temperature, precipitation, and SM to corresponding gridded observational data. This comparison is based on climatological means for summer (JJA) over CONUS and CGP, and involves correlations and simple statistics like quantile-quantile associations (spatially over CONUS), and inter-model correlations (based on spatial averages over CGP).</p>
