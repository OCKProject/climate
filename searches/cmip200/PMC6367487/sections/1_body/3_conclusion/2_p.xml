This calls for continued and improved large-scale SM satellite observations on the one hand, and for numerical experiments tailored to better understand the role of SM and irrigation in climate models on the other hand, as planned in the framework of CMIP6. Two CMIP6-Endorsed Model Intercomparison Projects (MIPs) are particularly relevant, namely LUMIP (Land Use MIP
