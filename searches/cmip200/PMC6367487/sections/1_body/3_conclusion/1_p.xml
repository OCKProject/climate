<p id="Par22" class="p">This research is the first one analysing the link between spatial patterns of SM biases and those of precipitation and air temperature in the context of CMIP5 models over the CONUS. The results confirm that SM, as a key driver of the water and energy fluxes at the land/atmosphere interface, must be accounted for to better understand the deficiencies of climate models. In combination with previous studies, our results also support the argument that land-atmosphere feedbacks over the extended CGP are not only local but have a regional dimension, owing to the atmospheric circulation. This could explain why the strongest associations between the dry and warm biases (dark red in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>) are found between the irrigation hotspots, while these hotspots rather correspond to warm/wet bias associations (yellow-shaded areas in Fig.
