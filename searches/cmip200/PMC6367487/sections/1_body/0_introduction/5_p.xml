<p id="Par6" class="p">We use the new SM data retrieved from L-band microwave observations from the first-dedicated SM mission SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) satellite (SMOS-IC product version) over 2010–2016. We also used earlier SM observations (1979–2008) from the first ever long-term satellite-based SM product prepared by the ESA’s Climate Change Initiative (CCI)

To make the comparison to the biases in air temperature and precipitation more robust, we also used multiple observational datasets for both variables: (i) Climatic Research Unit (CRU) air temperature and precipitation; (ii) University of Delaware (i.e., “Willmott”) global land air temperature; and (iii) Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) land precipitation. More details on these datasets and their processing are provided in the Methods section.
