<p id="Par5" class="p">Here, we use two recent remotely sensed SM products to evaluate the link between SM, precipitation and air temperature biases found in 20 models (see Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>) participating in CMIP5 over the CONUS during the 1979–2008 period. Note that in this study the objective was not to investigate the causality but rather to examine– for the first time – how remotely sensed SM observations fit into the (existing) understanding of how the air temperature and precipitation biases are linked in the models.
