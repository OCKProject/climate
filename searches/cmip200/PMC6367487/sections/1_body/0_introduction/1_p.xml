More specifically, pronounced systematic summer warm biases -relative to 2-m near surface air temperature (referred to as air temperature in the following) observations- have been found over many continental areas, including the conterminous United States (CONUS) and, more specifically, the CONUS Central Great Plains (CGP) region

 </sup>. Since air temperature lies at the centre of critical feedbacks between multiple climate system components, its bias (or error) can influence the overall reliability of the CMIP model simulations and future climate projections

 </sup>. Previous studies attributed these warm land biases to multiple factors including, but not limited to: deficiencies in cloud representation, errors in large-scale atmospheric circulation, misrepresented evaporation, and failure to capture heavy rainfall events
