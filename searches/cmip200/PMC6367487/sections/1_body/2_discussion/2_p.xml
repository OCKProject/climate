<p id="Par19" class="p">Yet, the misrepresentation of SM and related processes could also be a key shortcoming in the modelled climate by means of land-atmosphere coupling. In particular, it has been shown that irrigation has an observable cooling effect at local scale

 </sup>, when accounting for irrigation in coupled land-atmosphere models. Given that irrigation is overlooked by CMIP5 models, a relevant question is whether this missing surface process contributes to the warm and dry biases of CMIP5 models over the CGP region (red box), which includes two of the main three irrigation hotspots of the CONUS (Fig.
