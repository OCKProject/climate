<p id="Par21" class="p">We speculate that irrigation in this area may not be detected as increased SM values by satellite products, because it locally induces a decrease of precipitation, which feedbacks negatively onto local SM. In terms of model biases, the dry bias expected from missing irrigation would be offset by a positive precipitation bias (by missing irrigation-induced decrease of precipitation). Another explanation might be that the “extra” water provided by irrigation is quickly used by the vegetation and not visible at the monthly to seasonal scale. Both explanations remain consistent with the warm bias found over the CGP irrigation hotspots, since evaporation would miss in models overlooking irrigation; this missing evaporation could then contribute to the dry (for both precipitation and SM) and warm biases downwind of the CGP, corresponding to the red areas in the central south part of the red box of Fig.
