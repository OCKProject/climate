<p id="Par18" class="p">By analysing the spatial patterns of SM owing to large-scale satellite observations, we demonstrate a specific link between the warm bias and SM bias in CMIP5 models over the CGP, which “closes the loop” by proving the missing land surface link between precipitation and energy fluxes. This link, which has long been suspected in the literature
