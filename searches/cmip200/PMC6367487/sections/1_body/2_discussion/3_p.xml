 </sup> assessed several SM retrievals over the CONUS for their irrigation detection skill. All of them, including SMOS, are based on microwave remote sensing and involved in the CCI product used in the present study; and their irrigation detection skill was found to be weak, although better in the Mississippi valley. This “apparent inability” of microwave remote sensing observations to detect irrigation hotspots is partly attributed to the coarse resolution of the retrievals, especially for the passive microwave ones, but our results are suggestive of another explanation, related to regional-scale land-atmosphere coupling over the (extended) CGP (red box).
