<p id="Par10" class="p">In order to better characterize the spatial link between summer biases in air temperature, precipitation and SM, we computed bivariate maps that combine biases in SM (CMIP5 models - SMOS/CCI) and either air temperature (CMIP5 models - CRU) or precipitation (CMIP5 models - GPCP), based on quantile-quantile associations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). The multi-model ensemble (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a,b</xref>) reveals three main types of bias combinations: (i) a dry and warm bias (in red) mainly over the CGP, (ii) a wet and cold bias (in blue) over north-western CONUS and (iii) a dry and cold bias (in green) in south-western CONUS. Note that, to be more precise, the term “cold” is not really appropriate and we should rather speak of “the smallest warm biases”, since a large majority of the CMIP5 models overestimate mean summer air temperature over the CONUS (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>). The combination of a dry and cold bias (green areas in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a,b</xref>) is somewhat surprising. However, several mechanisms can be proposed to explain this. For example, dry soils may lead to excessive albedo or weakened thermal inertia leading to excessive nocturnal cooling during cloudless nights

 </sup>. Conversely, a cold bias can lead to a corresponding dry bias owing to the stabilization of the boundary layer – making it less prone to convection.
