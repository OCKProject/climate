 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S8</xref>–

In particular, the same three main areas can be distinguished: the CGP region associated with negative SM and precipitation biases (red), north-western CONUS associated with positive SM and precipitation biases (blue) and south-western CONUS (green), where very different responses can be noted depending on the CMIP5 models (red, blue or green colours can be seen in that region for the different models).
