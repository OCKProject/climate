 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a</xref>; blue areas in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a,b</xref>), there is a cold bias that can be partly explained by the positive precipitation and SM bias (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2c,d</xref>), via exacerbated ET and/or snow albedo cooling effects. The positive precipitation bias over mountain areas is a classical problem in climate models

 </sup>. As for the association of a wet and warm bias (yellow areas in Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S6</xref>–
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S9</xref>), it is quite rare (3 to 6% of the CONUS, depending on the bias association, as quantified on the right panels of Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>) and found mostly in sporadic areas and for a few models over Midwest (northcentral CONUS). Interestingly, the number of grid cells that are warm and dry (red areas in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>) is very similar whether using SMOS or CCI SM products. Heterogeneous results for the different models are also obtained in eastern CONUS.
