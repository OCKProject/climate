<p id="Par9" class="p">Interestingly, there is a good general agreement (with, again, the exception of GISS.E2.R) between areas of high warm bias and areas of strong precipitation and SM deficits (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a–f</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>–
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">5</xref> for each model separately). This is particularly notable in central CONUS (including the CGP). However, an area of negative bias in precipitation (for both CRU and GPCP) and SMOS SM in south-western CONUS (with a distinctive triangular shape) is not clearly associated with an overall corresponding warm bias.
