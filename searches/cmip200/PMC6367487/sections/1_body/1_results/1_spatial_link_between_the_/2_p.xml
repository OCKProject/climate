<p id="Par8" class="p">Reflecting these spatial patterns of precipitation biases, normalized SM is underestimated by a majority of models over the CGP and eastern CONUS in the CMIP5 simulations, while overestimated in north-western CONUS (Fig.

 </sup> who found clear underestimation of SM by the models during summertime over the South Great Plains (SGP) compared to both 
 <italic class="italic">in situ</italic> and CCI SM observations. Positive biases are more consistent across models for SM than for the precipitation, particularly over mountainous areas. Some differences can be noted between the SM bias spatial patterns derived from the SMOS and CCI datasets. For instance, over eastern CONUS, the precipitation bias maps are more consistent with the CCI map (although the CCI SM biases are shifted to the south relative to CRU and GPCP precipitation biases). The opposite is true over south-western CONUS (in e.g., Arizona, southern Nevada and southern California) where SMOS-based SM provides a better match to the observed pattern of precipitation bias.
