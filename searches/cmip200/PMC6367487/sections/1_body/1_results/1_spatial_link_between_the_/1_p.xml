 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a,b</xref> shows that the spatial patterns of the mean air temperature bias in CMIP5 simulations are very similar for the CRU and Willmott air temperature observations (see scatter plots of each pair of the different variables in Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref> in the Supplementary). Most of the CMIP5 simulations (more than 2/3; see Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref> for each CMIP5 model separately) systematically overestimate both observational datasets, particularly over the CGP region as previously described by Cheruy

 </sup>. However, there are two exceptions (viz. the GISS.E2.R and MRI.AGCM3.2 H models), with low air temperature biases and different spatial patterns compared to the other models (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>). Note that the singularity of the GISS.E2.R model has already been noted in previous studies e.g.

 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1c,d</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref> for each CMIP5 model separately). Compared with the precipitation observations, the CMIP5 models produce excessive precipitation over north-eastern and north-western CONUS and a deficit of precipitation over the CGP region and in south-western CONUS (which is consistent with both Klein
