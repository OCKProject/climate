 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">7b</xref> (Supplementary) display the same maps for each individual CMIP5 model. Despite the variability stemming from inter-model differences, these maps reveal systematic patterns structured by the east-west precipitation gradient and the Rocky Mountains (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a,b</xref>), which are well-known influential factors on CONUS climate. Interestingly, these patterns are much less systematic when looking at the individual temperature and SM biases present in each of the CMIP5 models (Figs 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>–
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">5</xref>), suggesting that regional drivers of the CONUS climate have more influence on the relationship between the different types of bias than on the biases themselves. Figures 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S6</xref>–
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">7b</xref> also show a few exceptions to the dominance of a warm and dry bias combination in the CGP. These exceptions notably include the two climate models (GISS.E2.R &amp; MRI.AGCM3.2H) characterized by low biases in air temperature and precipitation over CONUS compared to the other models.
