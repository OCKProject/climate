   <p id="Par16" class="p">a negative precipitation bias, likely caused by errors in the general circulation or a convection parameterization, is the driving force and creates a dry surface bias which, in turn, causes a warm bias. For this effect on air temperature, we also have two mechanisms, one is water related (low precipitation can create low SM directly, which reduces the cooling effect of evapotranspiration), and the other is energy related (low precipitation can also induce high downward shortwave radiation which will enhance both the latent and sensible heat fluxes, probably increasing air temperature, and decreasing SM); and</p>

   <p id="Par17" class="p">the land surface is the main cause of the interlinked biases, as low SM reduces evapotranspiration, and therefore warms the lower level of atmosphere and reduces precipitation, with possible enhancement owing to positive SM feedback. The bivariate maps and the correlation analyses (Figs 
    <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> and 
    <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>) reveal the link between the spatial patterns in the warm bias of summer air temperature produced by the majority of CMIP5 coupled climate models and dry SM biases, which are significantly correlated to precipitation deficits. In the same region, Cheruy

Yet the bias in EF was only qualitatively established against one estimate of EF with rather large uncertainty bounds. Our results show, despite observation uncertainties, that the CMIP5 models underestimate SM in the CGP, leading to lower values of EF
