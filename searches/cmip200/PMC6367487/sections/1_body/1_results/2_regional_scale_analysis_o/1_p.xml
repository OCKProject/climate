<p id="Par14" class="p">We have established a clear link between SM, precipitation and air temperature biases across several large CONUS regions (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S6</xref>–
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">9</xref>), but the most consistent spatial patterns and the stronger air temperature biases have been obtained over the CGP region (103°W–89°W, 32°N–48°N, displayed as a red box in Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). Therefore, we now focus on this particular region to better quantify the link between the warm bias found in most models and the negative biases of precipitation and SM. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4a</xref> confirms that a large majority of models overestimate air temperature and underestimate SM in the CGP during summer, with a strong negative inter-model correlation between these two biases (R = −0.65; 18 models out of 20 are in the upper-left quadrant), meaning that the warm bias is more pronounced when the dry bias is strong. A strong negative correlation is also found between the biases of precipitation and air temperature among the models, albeit with a slightly smaller correlation coefficient (R = −0.61, the same 18 models are in the upper-left quadrant), which is consistent with the larger variability of atmospheric variables in comparison to surface variables. Eventually, the strongest (positive) inter-model correlation (R = 0.87; the same 18 models are in the lower-left quadrant) are found between the biases in precipitation and SM, in agreement with the fact that precipitation exerts a strong control on SM. The same correlations are obtained when the biases are calculated with respect to the other observational datasets (see Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S10</xref>), which only changes the offset of the scatter plots.
