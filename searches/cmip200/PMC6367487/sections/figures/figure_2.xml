   <bold class="bold">a</bold>) Map relating the SMOS SM bias and the CRU air temperature (Temp) bias for the CMIP5 multimodel ensemble. (
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>) Map relating the CCI SM bias and the CRU Temp bias for the CMIP5 multimodel ensemble. (
   <bold class="bold">c</bold>) Map relating the SMOS SM bias and the GPCP precipitation (Pr) bias for the CMIP5 multimodel ensemble. (
   <bold class="bold">d</bold>) Map relating the CCI SM bias and the GPCP Pr bias for the CMIP5 multimodel ensemble. Multimodel reflects results for the CMIP5 ensemble mean. Note that each colour represents a 10% quantile shift (calculated with respect to the spatial histogram of bias results across the CONUS) in both soil moisture and air temperature/precipitation. White regions represent pixels with percentage of forest &gt;60%, strong topography, or frozen soil conditions, which were excluded from the analyses. Each square at the angle of the legends in the right column has a 30% Ã— 30% size with the % of pixels in this square.
