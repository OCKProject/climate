<p class="p">By applying a process-based biogeochemistry model, CENTURY, we quantified the carbon dynamics on the Tibetan Plateau grasslands in response to climate change and elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> under the RCP scenarios. The Tibetan Plateau grasslands behaved as a net carbon sink with the NEP of 16 ~ 25 Tg C yr
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> over the 21st century. However, the potential capacity for carbon sequestration on the Tibetan Plateau grasslands was predicted to decrease gradually with the slopes ranging from -0.14 to -0.07. The partial correlation between carbon fluxes and climate indicated that warming stimulated respiration more than plant growth. However, the elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> contributed more to plant growth than decomposition, which could offset the warming-induced carbon loss. The inter-annual and decadal-scale dynamics of the carbon fluxes were primarily controlled by temperature, while the role of precipitation became increasingly important in modulating carbon budgets in the alpine grassland. The stable precipitation accompanied by noticeable warming in RCP4.5 (2010s ~ 2030s and 2040s ~ 2060s) and RCP8.5 (2040s ~ 2060s) led to a reduction of carbon sink (Î”NEP) by -13%, -30% and -21%, respectively. These results highlighted the importance of precipitation in regulating the contribution of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fertilization and warming effect on carbon dynamics in a warmer climate scenario.
