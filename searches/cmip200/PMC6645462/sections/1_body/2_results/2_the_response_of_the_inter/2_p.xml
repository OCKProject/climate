<p class="p">As illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215261.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>, the simulated carbon fluxes exhibited a positive correlation with temperature (T
 <sub class="sub">mean</sub>) (R: 0.03 ~ 0.76), while the R between NEP and T
 <sub class="sub">mean</sub> equal to– 0.09. The positive responses of the NPP and Rh to T
 <sub class="sub">mean</sub> were stronger in RCP8.5 with R values of 0.54 (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215261.g004" class="xref">Fig 4A–4F</xref>), while the NPP and NEP showed an obvious negative responses to increasing temperature in the mid-western and northeastern part of the Plateau (R &lt; -0.2,

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215261.g004" class="xref">4G–4I</xref>). This was probably related to the the fact that limited rainfall in these areas could not meet the increase in water demand under warming. The magnitude of Rh increase in response to T
