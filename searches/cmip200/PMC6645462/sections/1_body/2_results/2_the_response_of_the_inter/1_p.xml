<p class="p">The simulated carbon fluxes exhibited a positive correlation with precipitation across the three RCP scenarios with the partial correlation coefficients (R) in the range of 0.07 ~ 0.48 (

Higher correlations between carbon fluxes (NPP and Rh) and precipitation were found in RCP8.5 with R values of 0.33 (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215261.g003" class="xref">Fig 3G–3I</xref>). This was probably due to the fact that precipitation gradually decreased from the southeast to the northwest [

Increased precipitation in the southeastern mountainous area could lead to more cloud cover, and thus have negative effects on photosynthesis. The Rh tended to be most sensitive to the precipitation variation (R:0.34 ~ 0.48,
