 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215261.g005" class="xref">Fig 5A, 5D and 5G</xref>), and the same decrease in ΔRh (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215261.g005" class="xref">Fig 5B, 5E and 5H</xref>), and consequently led to a decrease in ΔNEP from 25% to 16% and 6% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215261.g005" class="xref">Fig 5C, 5F and 5I</xref>). In response to the continual decrease in temperature and precipitation, the changes in the decadal carbon dynamics were predicted to show a corresponding downward trend in the RCP2.6 scenario. For RCP4.5, the ΔPrecipitation was -1%, 1%, and 0%, with the ΔT
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> 12%, 6%, and 4%, and the ΔT
 <sub class="sub">min</sub> 6%, 6%, and 4% in the 2010s ~ 2030s, 2040s ~ 2060s and 2070s ~ 2090s time periods, respectively. In this scenario, the reduction in the magnitude of the warming trend was accompanied by stable precipitation, which led to a corresponding decrease in ΔNPP of 5%, 3%, and 4%, and in ΔRh of 7%, 5%, and 4%, respectively. The discrepant magnitudes of the increase in NPP and Rh across different periods, resulting in the variations of the ΔNEP were -13%, -30%, and 8%, respectively. The decrease in ΔNEP in the first two periods was mainly due to a larger increase in Rh than NPP. Under RCP8.5, both the precipitation and temperature were projected to increase when the ΔPrecipitation was 5%, 1%, and 7%, and the ΔT
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> was 10%, 22%, and 14%, and the ΔT
 <sub class="sub">min</sub> was 7%, 20%, and 25% for 2010s ~ 2030s, 2040s ~ 2060s and 2070s ~ 2090s time periods, respectively. The projected large warming trend over the Tibetan Plateau would favor the growth of alpine grass, with a ΔNPP of 8%, 6%, and 8%, and could also exacerbate carbon decomposition with a ΔRh of 9%, 7%, and 8%, respectively. Consequently, the NEP correspondingly decreased by -3%, -21%, and -3%, respectively. The substantial decrease in the ΔNEP over the 2040s ~ 2060s time period was also partially due to the water stress under strong warming conditions. The dynamics of NEP were largely dependent on the different responses of NPP and Rh to climate change.
