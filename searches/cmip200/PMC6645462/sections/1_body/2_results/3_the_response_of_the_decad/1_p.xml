<p class="p">To quantify the carbon cycle of the Tibetan Plateau grasslands in response to the climate variability, we further evaluate the decadal-scale dynamics of climate and carbon budgets during three time periods (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215261.g005" class="xref">Fig 5</xref>). The 2010s ~ 2030s time period was calculated as the difference between the decadal averages of the years 2010 ~ 2019 and 2030 ~ 2039, and the same was done for the 2040s ~ 2060s and 2070s ~ 2090s time periods. The decadal change of carbon fluxes (e.g. ΔNPP and ΔRh) were positively linearly correlated with the ΔT
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215261.g005" class="xref">Fig 5D and 5E</xref>) and ΔT
 <sub class="sub">min</sub> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215261.g005" class="xref">Fig 5G and 5H</xref>), with R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> in a range of 0.59 ~ 0.67 (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.01). It was suggested that the increase in temperature could stimulate both vegetation production and also Rh. Furthermore, the linear slopes indicated that 1% increase in T
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> and T
 <sub class="sub">min</sub> caused a larger increase of Rh by 0.27% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215261.g005" class="xref">Fig 5C</xref>) and 0.24% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215261.g005" class="xref">Fig 5H</xref>) than those of NPP by 0.23% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215261.g005" class="xref">Fig 5D</xref>) and 0.21% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215261.g005" class="xref">Fig 5G</xref>). This suggested that Rh was more sensitive than NPP to increasing temperature. Consequently, the simulated NEP exhibited a decreasing trend under a warming climate. With respect to the response to the decadal change of precipitation, the dynamics of the ΔNPP and ΔRh showed an increasing trend with ΔPrecipitation, while these positive responses tended to be stagnant (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215261.g005" class="xref">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>). As the decadal change of precipitation varied within comparatively small ranges (~ 5%), temperature might play an important role in modulating the carbon fluxes of alpine grassland. Taken together, the changes in ΔNEP suggested that the alpine grassland still behaved as a carbon sink but its capacity declined over the 21st century.
