<p class="p">The distinctive geographic environment of the world highest plateau—Tibetan Plateau (with an average elevation of over 4000 m above sea level) makes its carbon cycle be strongly sensitive to climate variation and environmental change [

 <xref rid="pone.0215261.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. The Plateau covers a vast area of alpine vegetation and has a large reservoir of organic carbon in the permafrost soil, and it has been reported as a significant terrestrial carbon sink for recent decades due largely to warming and CO

 <xref rid="pone.0215261.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Furthermore, the fate of soil organic carbon (SOC) is controlled by the complex processes involving accumulation of carbon input by plant production and loss through microbial decomposition. Warming may also suppress plant growth by increasing evapotranspiration [
 <xref rid="pone.0215261.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>] and induce the soil carbon loss through enhanced Rh [
 <xref rid="pone.0215261.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. Thus the carbon fluxes can be amplified by increased carbon emissions from thawing permafrost [

 <xref rid="pone.0215261.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>] revealed that warming contributed to the net uptake of carbon in the permafrost zone in previous decades because carbon uptake by vegetation increased at a faster rate than that released from soil. Furthermore, increasing the atmospheric CO
