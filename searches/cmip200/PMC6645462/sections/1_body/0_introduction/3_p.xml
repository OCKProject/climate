<p class="p">In this study, we used an onsite calibrated and validated process-based model, CENTURY, to explore the responses of three important carbon cycle indicators, namely NPP, Rh and net ecosystem production (NEP), to future climate change projections on alpine grasslands of the Tibetan Plateau. The representative concentration pathways (RCP) scenarios of the climate change projections under the framework of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) vary in their total radiative forcing increase by 2100 [

The objectives of this paper are: (1) to predict the trends and differences in the ecosystem carbon cycle components in alpine grasslands under RCP scenarios during the 21st century; and (2) to differentiate the contributions of the changing climate variables (temperature and precipitation) and elevated CO
