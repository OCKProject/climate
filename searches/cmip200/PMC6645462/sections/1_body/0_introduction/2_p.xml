 <xref rid="pone.0215261.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>] found that the aboveground net primary production (NPP) was significantly stimulated in an alpine meadow under experimental warming, whereas it decreased in an alpine steppe due to warming-induced drought. Furthermore, there are situations that the climatic warming stimulated the ecosystem respiration more than NPP, which potentially led to loss of soil carbon in the Tibetan Plateau [

Thus, quantifying the influence of the future climatic change on the carbon exchange in alpine ecosystems in the Tibetan Plateau will promote our understanding of the mechanisms in the climate-carbon cycle feedbacks.
