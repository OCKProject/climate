 <xref rid="pone.0215261.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>] indicated that the increased resolution of RCMs was preferable for capturing the regional climate patterns, especially under the complex surface characteristics of the Tibetan Plateau. There are also substantial uncertainties in projected climate change for RCMs, coming from the driving GCMs and human action [
