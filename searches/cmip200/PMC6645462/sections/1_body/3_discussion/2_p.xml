 <xref rid="pone.0215261.ref064" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>], due largely to the high initial SOC density in high-latitude areas. Our findings suggested that the carbon sequestration in the vegetation and soil was projected to increase under three RCP scenarios, but the carbon sequestration rate was predicted to decrease gradually on the Tibetan Plateau grasslands.
