<p class="p">The carbon dynamics exhibited a large discrepancy in response to climate change with and without the effect of elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentrations. The carbon uptake by vegetation could be strongly stimulated by CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fertilization, especially in July [
 <xref rid="pone.0215261.ref065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>]. The increasing CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration accounted for 1.9% ~ 7.3% of the increase in NPP (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215261.g006" class="xref">Fig 6A</xref>), which was less than the range of 9% ~ 11% in the perennial grassland experiment at the Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve in central Minnesota during 1998 ~ 2010 [
 <xref rid="pone.0215261.ref066" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>]. Furthermore, the slope of NPP was predicted to increase by 18% ~ 29% under CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fertilization among all scenarios, which was slightly less than the estimates of Piao et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0215261.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>] (~ 39%) on the Tibetan Plateau grasslands during the past five decades. This was probably due to the effect of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fertilization, which tended to be saturated over time, and the discrepancy that existed in different models. Furthermore, the response of Rh to CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> was of the same magnitude (1.7% ~ 6.1%) as that in NPP during the 21st century. The elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentrations generally had a positive effect on soil respiration by regulating the carbon uptake and allocation, and on the availability of substrate and soil water [
 <xref rid="pone.0215261.ref067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>]. Consequently, the almost consistent increase in NPP and Rh caused by the elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> on the alpine grassland resulted in a relatively small difference in NEP (0.9 ~ 4.9 g C m
 <sup class="sup">-2</sup> yr
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215261.g006" class="xref">Fig 6C</xref>). However, the grassland carbon cycle was projected to be amplified by around two to three times due to higher CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentrations under RCP8.5 compared to that in RCP2.6 and RCP4.5. The different potential responses to elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> levels were partly due to the different climate conditions among the three RCP scenarios. For RCP2.6, the increasing CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> associated with a decreasing trend in temperature and precipitation had a minor effect on the carbon cycle (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215261.g006" class="xref">Fig 6A</xref>). Furthermore, the elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> favored plant growth limitedly in RCP4.5, as the continually warming and stable precipitation may induce water stress (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215261.g006" class="xref">Fig 6B</xref>). However, increasing temperature and precipitation, together with increasing CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, greatly enhanced the carbon uptake in the alpine ecosystem under RCP8.5 (
