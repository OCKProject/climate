<p class="p">The simulation began with an equilibrium run to generate an initial condition using long-term average climate data for the period from 1901~1930, which was then followed by a spin up (1980 ~ 2005) to eliminate system fluctuations and to steady the transient simulation. The climate input data for the history period of 1901 ~ 2005 was obtained from the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) Time-Series (TS) version 3.23 (TS 3.23), School of Environmental Sciences, University of East Anglia, United Kingdom [

 <xref rid="pone.0215261.ref050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. The CENTURY model was then forced with outputs from the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX), including monthly maximum and minimum temperature and precipitation under three RCPs scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). The CORDEX data used in this study were dynamical downscaled at a high spatial resolution of 0.5Â° with two regional climate models (RCMs) of RCA4 and REMO2009 driven by ICHEC-EC-EARTH and MPI-M-MPI-ESM-LR global models based on the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) simulations [
