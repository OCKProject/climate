   <bold class="bold">a</bold> Multimodel-median change at each latitude in (minus) annual- and zonal-mean mid-tropospheric vertical velocity between the historical (1985–2004) and RCP8.5 (2079–2098) simulations (black line). The red shading indicates the interquartile range in vertical velocity changes across models at each latitude. The vertical velocities have been vertically averaged (with mass weighting) from 700hPa to 300hPa. The red vertical lines show the multimodel-median northern and southern edges of the ITCZ in the historical simulations, as defined using the mass streamfunction method. 
   <bold class="bold">b</bold> Scatterplot of fractional changes in ITCZ strength versus fractional changes in ITCZ width between the historical and RCP8.5 simulations. The fractional changes in strength and width have been normalized by each model’s global-mean surface-air temperature change. The black dots indicate individual CMIP5 models and the red dot shows the median model changes. The correlation coefficient across models is
