<p id="Par13" class="p">The absence of significant trends in the locations of the Atlantic and Pacific ITCZs over recent decades (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="Sec19" class="xref">S1</xref>a,d) might appear to contradict previous studies that showed a southward shift of the ITCZ over the twentieth century associated with large concentrations of scattering sulfate aerosols in the Northern Hemisphere [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>]. Aerosol forcing also dried the Asian monsoon region over the same period [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" class="xref">65</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" class="xref">66</xref>]. However, the rainfall measurements showing a southward ITCZ shift over the twentieth century are from land regions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>]. Because of the short lifetimes of scattering aerosols, their radiative forcing is stronger over land—where the sources are—than over oceans [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>]. It is feasible that the ITCZ shifts in different ways over land and ocean because of the contrasting aerosol forcings, which could reconcile the negligible oceanic ITCZ shifts in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="Sec19" class="xref">S1</xref> with the previous studies using land data that found a southward shift. A further consideration is the variation of sulfur emissions over time and between regions. The period shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="Sec19" class="xref">S1</xref> (1979–2017) had declining sulfur emissions in North America and Western Europe but periods of increasing and subsequent decreasing emissions in Asia and Eastern Europe [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" class="xref">67</xref>]. Contrasting trends in emissions and scattering aerosol concentrations in these regions likely affected the ITCZ location in contrasting ways, and could help to explain why we do not observe a clear ITCZ shift over oceans in the last 39 years. Greenhouse gas concentrations were also changing over 1979–2017, and it is well known that the tropical circulation responds differently to aerosol versus greenhouse gas forcings [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" class="xref">68</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" class="xref">69</xref>]. The relative influences of these forcings on historical trends not only in ITCZ location but also in ITCZ width and strength could be disentangled using single-forcing simulations following Xie et al. (2013) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70" class="xref">70</xref>], and would be an interesting topic for future work.
