 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" class="xref">55</xref>] combined surface (1952–1997) and satellite observations (1984–1997) of clouds and radiation and found an increase in upper-level clouds in the central Pacific, with a corresponding decrease in the subtropical regions adjacent to the ITCZ. Concurrent surface-wind observations showed enhancements of convergence and precipitation in the central Pacific. A later study using a longer record of multiple, independent satellite cloud amount and top-of-atmosphere (TOA) albedo estimates found similar differences in cloud patterns between an early period in the satellite observational record (1980s) and a more recent period (2000s) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" class="xref">58</xref>]. High cloud increases in the Atlantic ITCZ are less pronounced, although reductions in the deepest clouds are present along the ITCZ margins. A recent examination of cloud and radiation datasets also found that tropical-mean high-cloud cover decreases while OLR and precipitation increase with surface warming at interannual timescales [
