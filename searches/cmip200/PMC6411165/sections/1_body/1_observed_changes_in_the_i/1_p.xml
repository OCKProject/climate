<p id="Par7" class="p">Observational analyses of the ITCZ and its changes rely heavily on satellite-based remote sensing because the majority of the ITCZ lies over oceans where 
 <italic class="italic">in situ</italic> observations are sparse. The ITCZ can be readily identified in satellite observations as a region of frequent high clouds with low values of outgoing longwave radiation (OLR), or as a meridional local precipitation maximum (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>a). A number of studies have automated identification and developed climatologies of ITCZ location using satellite cloud or radiation observations [
