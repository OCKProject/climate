 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">45</xref>] to automate monthly identification of the main convergence region associated with the ITCZ center. A series of dynamic and thermodynamic masks were applied to monthly reanalysis data to locate and connect the convergence zones. From the center location, the corresponding observational precipitation record was searched north and south until a minimum precipitation threshold was reached. In this analysis, the north-south distance through the ITCZ center location defines the width of ITCZ precipitation at a given longitude. A 35-year timeseries analysis of ITCZ location, width, and precipitation intensity confirmed and quantified findings by earlier studies [
