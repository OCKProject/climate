<p id="Par8" class="p">As satellite cloud and precipitation records have lengthened, these observations have increasingly been used to examine tropical hydroclimate variability and change in response to natural and anthropogenic forcings. Using the first 25 years of the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) dataset [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">47</xref>], Smith et al. (2006) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">48</xref>] showed evidence of temperature-driven precipitation trends in equatorial regions. Lau and Wu [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" class="xref">49</xref>] examined two blended satellite and 
 <italic class="italic">in situ</italic> precipitation datasets and found a shift in the frequency of occurrence of heavy precipitation events from the first to the latter half of the satellite record that was largely driven by increases in heavy precipitation in the ITCZ. An additional study found a band of consistent precipitation increases in the Pacific ITCZ sandwiched between precipitation decreases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" class="xref">50</xref>], similar to the pattern shown in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>b. Using an updated precipitation record, Gu et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">51</xref>] examined interdecadal precipitation variability and again found large precipitation and water vapor increases in the tropical Pacific, with decreases on the margins of the ITCZ. An empirical orthogonal function analysis indicated that most of the changes could be attributed to surface warming and Pacific decadal variability.
