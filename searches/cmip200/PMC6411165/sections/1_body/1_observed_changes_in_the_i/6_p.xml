<p id="Par12" class="p">Satellite cloud and precipitation observations tell a coherent story of decreasing ITCZ width and increasing precipitation intensity. These findings from satellite observations are further supported by ocean surface salinity observations. Sea-surface salinity and precipitation minus evaporation (
