<p id="Par36" class="p">The zonal-mean theory for ITCZ location undoubtedly gives insights into why the ITCZ lies north of the equator in today’s climate, and provides a quantitative framework with which to examine past and future ITCZ shifts. However, the impacts of climate change are experienced regionally and models suggest that local tropical precipitation changes are not tightly coupled to the zonal-mean ITCZ location [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">21</xref>]. Furthermore, if we seek to develop a robust understanding of tropical circulation and precipitation in past climates, we need to advance the theory for ITCZ location beyond the zonal mean and make hindcasts that can be compared to paleoclimate data which are inherently regional. Recently, an important step towards a regional theory for ITCZ location has been made by generalizing the energetic theory through the definition of an “energy flux potential” [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74" class="xref">74</xref>] which essentially extends the theory to the zonal direction. Thus far, this extended theory has been applied to explain continental rainfall shifts in the mid-Holocene [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>] and the observed seasonal and interannual behavior of the zonally anomalous ITCZ over recent decades [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74" class="xref">74</xref>]. The response of regional tropical precipitation to climate change is highly uncertain [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96" class="xref">96</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115" class="xref">115</xref>], and this new method should now be applied to identify the processes contributing to inter-model uncertainty on regional scales.
