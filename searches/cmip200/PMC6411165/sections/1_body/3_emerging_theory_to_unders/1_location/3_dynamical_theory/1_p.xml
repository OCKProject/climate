<p id="Par33" class="p">An alternative dynamical theory for ITCZ location, less prominent in the literature than the energetic theory, is based on principles of tropical atmospheric dynamics [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107" class="xref">107</xref>]. Assuming convection is sufficiently active in the ITCZ such that the lapse rate is close to moist adiabatic [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108" class="xref">108</xref>] and further assuming the Hadley circulation conserves angular momentum in the free troposphere, the ITCZ location is expected to lie just equatorward of the maximum in boundary-layer moist static energy. Over oceans, assuming near-surface relative humidity is sufficiently constant in space, the dynamical theory implies that the ITCZ location is just equatorward of the maximum in sea-surface temperature (SST). The dynamical theory is broadly verified by an observational analysis of monsoons though the presence of dry, shallow circulations can complicate the picture [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109" class="xref">109</xref>]. Although this dynamical theory is diagnostic in the sense that the ITCZ location can be determined only if the distribution of boundary-layer moist static energy is known, it nevertheless provides a distinct framework to the energetic theory with which to understand ITCZ migrations. (See Shekhar &amp; Boos [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110" class="xref">110</xref>] for a systematic comparison of the energetic and dynamical theories for ITCZ location.)
