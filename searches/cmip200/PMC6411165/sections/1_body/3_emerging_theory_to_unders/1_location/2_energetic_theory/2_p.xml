<p id="Par29" class="p">Using idealized simulations with a “slab” ocean, a collection of studies has advanced our understanding of the zonal-mean ITCZ location by quantitatively connecting interhemispheric contrasts in net TOA radiation, the cross-equatorial energy flux and ITCZ location [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>]. Early versions of this energetic theory assumed a passive ocean and a cross-equatorial atmospheric energy flux that is associated entirely with the zonal-mean Hadley circulation, with negligible contributions from transient or stationary eddies. These studies identified the ITCZ location as the latitude where the poleward atmospheric energy flux is zero (the so-called “energy flux equator” [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>]). According to this theory, an increase in the interhemispheric TOA radiation contrast (as a result of, say, imposing ice in one hemisphere and increasing its albedo [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>]) requires an increase in cross-equatorial energy flux by the Hadley circulation and a shift of the ITCZ further into the hemisphere that is receiving additional radiation.
