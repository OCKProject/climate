<p id="Par30" class="p">The relationship between the cross-equatorial energy flux and ITCZ location is central to the energetic theory, as it controls how far the ITCZ must shift in response to interhemispheric radiation asymmetries. Studies suggest that the ITCZ moves 3° latitude per 1 petawatt (PW) of cross-equatorial atmospheric energy flux [
