<p id="Par45" class="p">In CMIP5 simulations, ITCZ narrowing has been found to be driven by steepening of the meridional moist static energy gradient with global warming—this enhances cooling of the ITCZ by Hadley circulation advection and transient-eddy divergence, which affect the tropical vertical velocity and hence the ITCZ width [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">30</xref>]. Energy-transporting transient eddies originating in mid-latitudes are thus an important non-local influence on the ITCZ width. Over oceans, moist static energy is strongly controlled by SST, which itself is shaped by atmosphere-ocean coupling processes. As a result, a change in SST pattern—and in particular the meridional SST gradient—is a means by which the ocean can influence the ITCZ width (in addition to the ocean’s central role in setting net energy input to the atmosphere via surface fluxes). Inter-model spread in the response of the tropical circulation to climate change has been linked to differences in SST patterns [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123" class="xref">123</xref>], and the diagnostic equation described above gives new physical insights into why the ITCZ depends on SST patterns. ITCZ narrowing due to steepening meridional moist static energy gradients is opposed by a widening tendency due to changes in gross moist stability and increases in shortwave absorption in the atmosphere resulting from cloud and clear-sky effects [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">30</xref>]. The processes that narrow the ITCZ with warming overcome the widening processes in most, but not all, CMIP5 models (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>b). Clearly, projected changes in ITCZ width result from a delicate balance between competing effects, and examining in more detail how well climate models capture this balance is a challenge for future work.
