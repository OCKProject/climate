<p id="Par44" class="p">The theory described above quantifies how changes in four distinct climate processes influence ITCZ width, and the physical interpretation for these influences is straightforward. Take net energy input to the atmosphere as an example. If climate is perturbed such that net energy input to the ITCZ increases, perhaps due to increased CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentrations and reduced longwave cooling, the ITCZ circulation must strengthen to transport this excess energy poleward (assuming a thermally direct mean divergent circulation, i.e., that gross moist stability is positive). All else being equal in this thought experiment, the vertical mass flux in the descent region of the Hadley circulation remains unchanged, implying that the ITCZ narrows so as to maintain equal and opposite mass fluxes in the ITCZ and descent region (Figure
