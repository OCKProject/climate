<p id="Par42" class="p">An alternative hypothesis using two heuristic models linking moisture, vertical velocity, and rainfall distributions suggests that an increase in the skewness of the vertical velocity distribution under global warming could explain ITCZ narrowing [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref>]. This increase in skewness arises naturally from the asymmetric effect of latent heating on vertical motions, consistent with earlier work [
