<p id="Par41" class="p">Examination of the narrowing of the ITCZ in response to global warming has stimulated further interest in the physics governing ITCZ width. A number of mechanisms have been put forward to explain this narrowing. The “upped-ante” hypothesis based on analyses of the atmospheric moisture and moist static energy budgets [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>] argues that decreases in precipitation on the margins of tropical convective regions under global warming are caused by boundary-layer advection of anomalously dry air from neighboring non-convective regions. This advective drying in the boundary layer, combined with enhanced upper-tropospheric warming, inhibits convection on the ITCZ edges and reduces precipitation. However, the upped-ante hypothesis is not a complete explanation; it does not account for processes such as the divergence of moist static energy out of the tropics by transient eddies and changes in net energy input to the atmosphere, which have been shown to affect ITCZ width in a warming climate [
