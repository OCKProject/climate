<p id="Par43" class="p">Recently, a new diagnostic equation linking the ITCZ width to energy transports in the climate system has been derived [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">36</xref>] and applied to quantify the processes contributing to ITCZ narrowing under global warming [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">30</xref>] (see Section 3 of Byrne and Schneider [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">36</xref>] for a derivation and discussion of this equation). By combining the mass and moist static energy budgets of the Hadley circulation, the equation demonstrates that the ITCZ narrows or widens due to changes in four processes: (i) gross moist stability, (ii) net energy input to the atmosphere [the

 <xref rid="Equ5" ref-type="" class="xref">5</xref>], (iii) advection of moist static energy by the Hadley circulation, and (iv) divergence of moist static energy from the tropics by transient eddies. Interestingly, because the Hadley circulation mass budget links area fractions and vertical velocities in the ITCZ and descent regions, processes in both the ITCZ and descent regions can change the ITCZ width (though local processes within the ITCZ are typically dominant because the gross moist stability is small there [
