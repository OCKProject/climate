<p id="Par51" class="p">We now list specific questions related to ITCZ width and strength on which we believe progress can readily be made. It is established that the mean tropical circulation weakens under global warming, but why does this weakening manifest as a “deep-tropics squeeze” within the ITCZ (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>a)? This pattern of circulation change will undoubtedly shape future hydroclimate in the tropics, and could influence global radiation balance and climate sensitivity via its impact on the area of convective anvil clouds [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>]. Analyses of atmospheric moisture and moist static energy budgets [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>], and equatorial SST warming patterns [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR135" class="xref">135</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR136" class="xref">136</xref>], suggest that gross moist stability influences the pattern of vertical velocity (and hence precipitation) changes in the ITCZ. However, a simple thermodynamic scaling for gross moist stability [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR137" class="xref">137</xref>] only partly captures its response to external forcing in climate models [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138" class="xref">138</xref>]. As a result, constructing a predictive theory for tropical vertical velocity and ITCZ strength using atmospheric moisture and energy budgets remains a challenge. The horizontal momentum budget and first-baroclinic mode of the tropical atmosphere have been used to construct a quantitative theory for vertical velocity in subtropical stationary circulations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR139" class="xref">139</xref>], and such an approach could be adapted to the ITCZ problem to better understand the “deep-tropics squeeze”.
