<p id="Par37" class="p">In comparison to the ITCZ location, we have only a limited mechanistic framework for interpreting changes in the width and strength of the ITCZ. Arguably these features are as important to understand and predict as ITCZ location, given that changes in ITCZ width and strength are likely to have important implications for hydroclimates in tropical regions.</p>
