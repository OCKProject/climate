<p id="Par48" class="p">Observed and projected changes in ITCZ width and strength are more robust than changes in ITCZ locationâ€”a clear target for future research is to understand these changes. The development of the energetic theory for ITCZ location has come about through a combination of theory and a hierarchy of simulations. We believe that this hierarchical approach [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126" class="xref">126</xref>] should be the template for new research to develop, test and refine hypotheses for how the ITCZ width and strength respond to climate change.
