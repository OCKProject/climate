<p id="Par56" class="p">In this review, we have focused on the annual- and zonal-mean ITCZ structure, which is a sensible starting point for interpreting the real-world tropical circulation. However, a goal for climate dynamics is to predict regional responses to climate change [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR143" class="xref">143</xref>] and ultimately our challenge is to develop theories for the ITCZ that apply in different seasons and regions. Recent work has extended the energetic theory for ITCZ location to the zonal direction and similar advances in theories for ITCZ width and strength now need to be made. Motivated by the development of our knowledge of ITCZ location through conceptual insights and the use of idealized models, we propose using a hierarchy of simulations to broadly explore the processes determining ITCZ structure and to stimulate further mechanistic understanding. Such an approach is now needed in order to reduce the considerable uncertainties in how the ITCZ will change in the future.
