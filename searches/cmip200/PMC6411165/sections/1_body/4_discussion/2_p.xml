<p id="Par54" class="p">Climate dynamicists have been successful in developing an energetic theory that relates ITCZ location to cross-equatorial energy transport. Extensions to this theory have incorporated atmosphere-ocean coupling and energy input to the tropical atmosphere, and the theory has recently been generalized so as to be applicable beyond the zonal mean. An opportunity for further development is to account for the roles of atmospheric transient and stationary eddies in setting the modern-day ITCZ location and in modulating its response to climate change. A distinct but complementary dynamical theory for ITCZ location has also been developed. These advances in understanding ITCZ location were partly motivated by the paleoclimate record, and were driven by key conceptual insights combined with idealized simulations focused on physical mechanisms.</p>
