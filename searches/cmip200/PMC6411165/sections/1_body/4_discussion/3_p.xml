<p id="Par55" class="p">Theories for the ITCZ width and strength are neither as developed nor as extensively tested as those for ITCZ location, but are beginning to emerge. A study with two heuristic models of precipitation indicates a decrease in the rain area fraction as the climate warms, and the upped-ante hypothesis predicts reductions in precipitation on the margins of convergence zones; both are consistent with observed and predicted ITCZ narrowing. An energetic theory, analogous to that developed for ITCZ location, quantifies how processes including gross moist stability and net energy input to the atmosphere contribute to changes in ITCZ width, and this theory has been applied to projected ITCZ changes. This energetic theory is diagnostic rather than predictive, but it suggests that changes in ITCZ width are related to the climatological gross moist stability; gross moist stability is thus a potential emergent constraint on ITCZ width. Although it is well established that the total atmospheric mass transport weakens in a warming world, resulting in the anti-correlation between changes in ITCZ width and strength across climate models, we do not yet have a complete theory to capture the “deep-tropics squeeze” pattern of these circulation changes.</p>
