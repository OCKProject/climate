<p id="Par4" class="p">Earth’s deep-tropical climate is dominated by the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ), a narrow band of rising air and intense precipitation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>a). Precipitation in the ITCZ is driven by moisture convergence associated with the northerly and southerly trade winds that collide near the equator. The ITCZ accounts for 32% of global precipitation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>] and shapes climate and society in the tropics; any response of the ITCZ to climate change will have implications for tropical regions. It has also been suggested that, through its influence on the global radiation budget, the ITCZ could influence global temperature and precipitation and their responses to climate change [
