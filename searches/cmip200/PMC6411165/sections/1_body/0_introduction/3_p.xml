<p id="Par6" class="p">Our objectives for this review are to (i) analyze how the ITCZ has changed over recent decades (
 <xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Observed Changes in the ITCZ</xref>), (ii) summarize projections for future changes in ITCZ location, width, and strength from state-of-the-art climate simulations (
 <xref rid="Sec3" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Projected Changes in the ITCZ Over the Twenty-first Century</xref>), and (iii) outline the physical theory underpinning these observed and projected changes (
 <xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Emerging Theory to Understand ITCZ Responses</xref>). We finish with a summary and discussion of priorities for future research (
 <xref rid="Sec18" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Discussion</xref>).
