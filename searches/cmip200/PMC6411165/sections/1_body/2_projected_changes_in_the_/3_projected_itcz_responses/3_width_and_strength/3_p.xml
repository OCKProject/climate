<p id="Par26" class="p">Most CMIP5 models (24/32) predict reduced ITCZ strength (i.e., weaker upward motion) under global warming (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>c), with a median fractional weakening of 0.69%/K and an interquartile range of 1.75%/K. As is the case for changes in ITCZ width, this weakening is more robust across climate models than changes in ITCZ location, though there is considerable inter-model spread. Although the ITCZ weakens with warming on average, this weakening is the small residual between two larger quantities: strongly reduced ascent on the equatorward edges of the ITCZ and increased ascent in the core of the ITCZ [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>] (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>a). This pattern of vertical velocity changes in the ITCZ has been termed the “deep-tropics squeeze” [
