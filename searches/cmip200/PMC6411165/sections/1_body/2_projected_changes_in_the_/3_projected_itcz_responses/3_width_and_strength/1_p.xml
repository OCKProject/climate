<p id="Par24" class="p">The majority of CMIP5 models (22/32) predict a narrowing of the ITCZ over the twenty-first century [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">30</xref>] (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>b): The median fractional change in ITCZ width is − 0.52%/K with an interquartile range of 1.17%/K. The fractional ITCZ width changes correspond to a median absolute narrowing of − 0.14°/K, which is associated primarily with a northward shift of the southern ITCZ edge [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">30</xref>] (the observed ITCZ narrowing over recent decades is also due mostly to a northward shift of the southern ITCZ edge [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>]). By the small-angle approximation, fractional changes in ITCZ width and area are very similar. ITCZ narrowing contrasts with the overall widening of the Hadley circulation under global warming [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89" class="xref">89</xref>]. The predicted fractional changes in ITCZ width are smaller than fractional changes in the width of the descent region of the Hadley circulation, and the changes are strongly anti-correlated [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">30</xref>]: Climate models that predict a large widening of the dry, subtropical descent region tend to also predict a large narrowing of the wet, tropical ITCZ. Changes in the width of the ITCZ defined using mass versus moisture convergence are well correlated [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">30</xref>], indicating that the predicted narrowing of tropical ascent will coincide with changes in the hydrological cycle near the edges of the ITCZ. The relationship between mass and moisture definitions of the ITCZ suggests that a theory for the mass ITCZ will be useful for interpreting and predicting changes in the moisture ITCZ and in tropical hydroclimates.
