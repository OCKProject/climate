<p id="Par25" class="p">To directly compare simulated future changes in ITCZ width to the observed trends shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="Sec19" class="xref">S1</xref>, we apply the observational analysis technique of Wodzicki and Rapp [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>] based on precipitation to the CMIP5 models. Using this technique, we find that models show a narrowing of the Atlantic ITCZ with global warming at a median rate of approximately 3%/K, which is larger than the narrowing of the zonal-mean ITCZ based on the mass streamfunction definition (0.52%/K), but considerably smaller than the observed narrowing over recent decades which we estimated to be 20%/K. Applying this technique used for the observed trends to the Pacific ITCZ, models predict a widening at a median rate of approximately 3%/K, which contrasts with the observed narrowing in the Pacific (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="Sec19" class="xref">S1</xref>e). The contrasting responses of the Atlantic and Pacific ITCZs to observed global warming over recent decades versus in model simulations of the future have multiple potentially valid interpretations. One suggests that models are deficient in simulating processes that control ITCZ structure; this is a well known and ongoing issue in climate modeling that often manifests as a “double ITCZ” bias [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90" class="xref">90</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91" class="xref">91</xref>]. Another is simply that internal variability, rather than a forced trend, in regional ITCZ width drives the observed variation.
