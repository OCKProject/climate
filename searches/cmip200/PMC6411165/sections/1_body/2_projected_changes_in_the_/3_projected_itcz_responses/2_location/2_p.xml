<p id="Par23" class="p">Although the zonal-mean ITCZ is our focus here, it should be noted that tropical precipitation at individual longitudes is only weakly related to the zonal-mean ITCZ (at least in climate models [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">21</xref>]), and so it is plausible that regional changes in ITCZ location under global warming could be substantially larger than the median predicted zonal-mean change of 0.03°/K. Indeed paleoclimate records suggest the zonal-mean ITCZ has shifted by no more than 1° between present day and either the Last Glacial Maximum or the mid-Holocene [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83" class="xref">83</xref>], yet regional ITCZ migrations of more than 5° have been inferred from paleoclimate reconstructions [
