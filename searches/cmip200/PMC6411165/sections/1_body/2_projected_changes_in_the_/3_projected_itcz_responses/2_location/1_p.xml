 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78" class="xref">78</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84" class="xref">84</xref>], few studies have focused on future changes. Our analysis shows that climate models predict no robust change in ITCZ location over the twenty-first century (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>a). The median model shows a northward shift of 0.03° latitude per kelvin of global-mean surface-air warming, with an interquartile range across models of 0.46°/K. Approximately half of the models analyzed (17/32) predict a northward ITCZ shift with warming, with the remaining models (15/32) predicting a southward shift. The negligible future change predicted by the median climate model is consistent with small changes between pre-industrial control and abrupt 4 ×CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> simulations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>] and a relatively constant annual-mean ITCZ location over recent decades [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>] (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="Sec19" class="xref">S1</xref>a,d). It has been suggested that interhemispheric radiative forcing asymmetries associated with declining Northern Hemisphere scattering aerosol concentrations over the twenty-first century may drive a northward shift of the ITCZ [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85" class="xref">85</xref>]. If aerosols are indeed driving a northward ITCZ shift, the response of the median model in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>a suggests that it is either a weak effect in that model or it is being almost entirely balanced by competing effects. However, there are large differences in aerosol radiative forcing across climate models in both historical and future simulations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86" class="xref">86</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87" class="xref">87</xref>], and it is likely that this forcing uncertainty contributes to the inter-model spread in projected ITCZ shifts.
