<p id="Par20" class="p">Using the circulation-based definitions of the zonal-mean ITCZ location, width and strength outlined above, we calculate projected changes in ITCZ structure over the twenty-first century using 32 state-of-the-art climate models

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77" class="xref">77</xref>]. We examine annual-mean changes between the historical (1985–2004) and RCP8.5 (2079–2098) simulations. A limited number of studies have assessed projected changes in ITCZ location [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>], width [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">30</xref>] and strength [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">29</xref>] but these studies have used different sets of simulations and different metrics for the ITCZ. Here, we use a common set of CMIP5 simulations and consistent metrics for ITCZ location, width, and strength to systematically examine projected ITCZ changes. Examining the ITCZ location, width and strength changes side-by-side enables comparison of the robustness in the respective responses.
