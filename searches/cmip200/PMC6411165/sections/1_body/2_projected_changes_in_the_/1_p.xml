<p id="Par14" class="p">In this section, we will consider projected changes in ITCZ location, width and strength over the twenty-first century. Numerous studies have examined ITCZ location and its variability but few have focused on its width and strength. As a consequence, metrics for ITCZ width and strength are less established in the literature. Before analyzing projected ITCZ changes, we first define our metrics for ITCZ location, width and strength.</p>
