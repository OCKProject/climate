 <xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="" class="xref">1</xref>–
 <xref rid="Equ4" ref-type="" class="xref">4</xref>)] are restricted by difficulties in directly observing the large-scale circulation. Consequently, in our analysis of recent ITCZ trends (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="Sec19" class="xref">S1</xref>), we use metrics largely derived from satellite observations of precipitation intensity. Climate model trends in ITCZ location [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">21</xref>] and width [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">30</xref>] based on circulation versus precipitation metrics are qualitatively similar, but quantitative comparisons are more challenging. However, for trends in ITCZ strength it is less clear that the circulation and precipitation metrics should scale together as climate changes. Precipitation can be approximated as the product of atmospheric moisture content and circulation strength. The contribution of moisture content to changes in precipitation (the “thermodynamic component”) is well understood [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75" class="xref">75</xref>] but the circulation contribution is not (the “dynamic component”). In our analyses below of projected changes in ITCZ strength we focus on the uncertain dynamic component and use the circulation-based definition (
 <xref rid="Equ4" ref-type="" class="xref">4</xref>). We note, however, that a direct comparison between modeled changes in ITCZ strength (defined in terms of circulation) and observed changes (defined in terms of precipitation intensity) is not straightforward given that observed changes in precipitation are due to both changes in circulation and atmospheric moisture content [
