<p id="Par16" class="p">Metrics that have been used to define the ITCZ fall into two broad categories: those based on precipitation and those based on atmospheric mass and energy fluxes. The ITCZ location has been defined as the latitude (i) where the mid-tropospheric atmospheric mass streamfunction is zero [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" class="xref">71</xref>], (ii) where the poleward flux of moist static energy by the atmosphere vanishes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">19</xref>], (iii) where tropical precipitation has a maximum [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>], and (iv) where the centroid of tropical precipitation lies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>]. Several methods have also been used to define the ITCZ width: (i) the tropical region where there is low-level mass convergence and ascending air on average (the “mass ITCZ” [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">36</xref>]), (ii) the region where there is moisture convergence and 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> − 
 <italic class="italic">E</italic> is positive (the “moisture ITCZ” [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">36</xref>]), and (iii) the tropical region with either brightness temperature below a specified threshold (indicative of the presence of high clouds) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" class="xref">72</xref>] or rain rate above a specified threshold [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>]. The strength of the ITCZ is often left unquantified though obvious metrics include the strength of upward motion averaged over the ITCZ or the maximum zonal-mean precipitation rate. The magnitudes of the location, width and strength of the ITCZ depend on the metrics chosen to quantify them.
