<p id="Par15" class="p">The discussion of observed ITCZ characteristics in the previous section focused on observable quantities, primarily precipitation. However, defining the ITCZ using observations requires choices such as the thresholds of precipitation or OLR used to define the center and edges of the ITCZ. An alternative and intuitive set of metrics for characterizing the ITCZ is based on the atmospheric mass circulation. Characterizing the large-scale tropical circulation directly in observations is not feasible. In models, however, we can apply consistent circulation-based definitions and assess how the ITCZ structure responds to climate change across models. Below we briefly review existing definitions of ITCZ structure before presenting the metrics, based on the mass streamfunction, that we will use to analyze model projections of the ITCZ.</p>
