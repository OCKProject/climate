<p id="Par17" class="p">To be clear, for this section on model projections, we discuss changes in the ITCZ structure defined in terms of the annual zonal-mean Eulerian-mean meridional streamfunction [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73" class="xref">73</xref>]. The meridional streamfunction, 
 <italic class="italic">ψ</italic>(
 <italic class="italic">ϕ</italic>,
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>), is a function of latitude (
 <italic class="italic">ϕ</italic>) and atmospheric pressure (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>), and quantifies the zonal-mean circulation of atmospheric mass in units of kilograms per second. We choose to focus on the zonal-mean ITCZ as a starting point for understanding the more complex behavior of the zonally varying ITCZ. For example, the well-established energetic theory for ITCZ location was largely developed in a zonal-mean framework [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">19</xref>], and later the mechanistic insights gained from this simplified setup have inspired a more comprehensive theory that takes into account the zonal structure [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74" class="xref">74</xref>]. Our lack of basic understanding of the width and strength of the ITCZ implies that there is still much to learn from the zonal-mean perspective before we proceed to tackling the more complex problem of understanding longitudinal variations.
