<p class="p">Climate warming in response to actual emission reductions within the framework of the Paris Agreement remains an ongoing interest. Most of the published studies are based on representative concentration pathways (RCP) or 2.0 °C/1.5 °C scenarios, which do not account for the current national mitigation commitments negotiated by governments. In this study, we quantified the regional climate change based on the self-determined emission reduction commitments made in climate negotiations as the starting point to assess the future climate response. Our results indicate that the climate warming under the INDC scenarios is projected to greatly exceed the long-term goal of the Paris Agreement of stabilizing the global mean temperature above the 2.0 °C or 1.5 °C level. Extreme high-temperature events in CA will become more intense, more frequent, and longer-lasting with the enhancement of global warming, and their responses to global warming are basically linear. If the global emission reductions are further strengthened to achieve the ambitious 2.0 °C/1.5 °C temperature target, the benefits with respect to the reduction of the regional risk associated with record-breaking high-temperature events are remarkable.</p>
