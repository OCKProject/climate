<p class="p">Previous studies, which are based on the CMIP5 dataset, were not specifically designed for the assessment of the climate response under the Paris Agreement. The recent NCAR CESM Low-Warming [
 <xref rid="B40-ijerph-16-02661" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>] and HAPPI experiments [
 <xref rid="B41-ijerph-16-02661" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>], which aim to quantify the impacts on weather-related risks corresponding to a warming of 1.5 °C or 2.0 °C, are not specific to the INDC pledges, which are the focus of this study. Currently, the targeted experimental design concerning INDC emissions that are consistent with the Paris Agreement is still lacking. In addition, the resolutions of GCMs are too coarse to more precisely capture regional signals of climate extremes, while regional climate models (RCMs) with finer resolutions and more sophisticated processes have better abilities to reproduce the regional climate characteristics [
 <xref rid="B42-ijerph-16-02661" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. Thus, a targeted experiment associated with INDC emission pledges based on RCMs is needed to better project the changes in extreme high-temperatures at smaller regional scales in CA and provide policy makers with more precise information.
