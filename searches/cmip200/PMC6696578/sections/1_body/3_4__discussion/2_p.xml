<p class="p">The definition of a HW (extreme high-temperature event) has a direct impact on the estimations of the HW intensity, frequency, trend, and spatial distribution [
 <xref rid="B31-ijerph-16-02661" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. The slight differences in the projected HWs between different studies could be explained by the definition of the HW and/or the dataset used. Furthermore, HWs should be defined based on a combination of temperature and humidity, which are more closely associated with human health [
