<p class="p">In this study, the regional mean and extreme high-temperature changes in CA are examined in association with the INDC emission scenarios and compared with those based on the 2.0 째C/1.5 째C scenarios. The key questions are (a) how will the regional SAT change under the INDC scenario in different regions of CA, (b) how will the extreme high-temperature change under the INDC scenario, and (c) what impacts can be avoided in CA by lowering the warming level (e.g., 2.0 째C or 1.5 째C) compared with the INDC scenario? The multi-model ensemble of 32 global climate models (GCMs) from the Fifth Coupled Climate Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) was used in this study.</p>
