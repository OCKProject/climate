<p class="p">Future greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions will have an important impact on regional climate extremes in the next few decades. By considering the INDC emission scenarios and synthesizing national INDC mitigation targets, this bottomâ€“up approach reflecting the willingness of each country to reduce their GHG emissions is more realistic, because it avoids the divergence of different countries from the distribution quota [

Few studies evaluated the possible changes of regional extreme high-temperature events under the INDC pledges, so that the socioeconomic system risks associated with the temperature-related extreme change in the next few decades are still unknown.
