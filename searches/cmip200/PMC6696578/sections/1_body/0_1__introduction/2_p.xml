<p class="p">Central Asia (CA) has a typical temperate continental climate that is characterized by sharp temperature ranges, intensive evaporation, and dry and rainless environments, which depend on the location and topography. As one of the worldâ€™s most arid areas, CA has an extremely fragile natural environment and ecological system, and thus is extremely sensitive to climate change [

 <xref rid="B11-ijerph-16-02661" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. However, information about the variations in climate extremes and their effects on ecological and social systems remains scarce. The extent of the impact of regional warming, which can be avoided by lowering the warming level, deserves special attention. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the changes of high-temperature events in CA under different climate scenarios.
