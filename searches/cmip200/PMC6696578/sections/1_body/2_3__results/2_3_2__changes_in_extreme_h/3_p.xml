<p class="p">In contrast to the uniform changes in TMX3day and TNX3day, the change magnitudes of HWs show regional differences, with larger magnitudes in the low-altitude areas (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02661-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>). A notable increase lasting more than seven days mainly occurs in the south of CA (except for the Pamir Mountains) under the INDC scenario. The population density-weighted average changes are more intense in UZB, TKM, and TJK (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02661-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>). The spatial patterns are similar, but the changes in the HWs under the 2.0°C/1.5°C scenarios are less significant compared with the INDC scenario (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02661-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>). Record-breaking HW events will also remarkably increase (similar to TMX3day and TNX3day); approximately 55%/51% of the population/area in CA will break the historical record under the INDC-pledge scenario. The increased amount of record-breaking HW events will be more evident in TKM and UZB.
