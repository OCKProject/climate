<p class="p">Record-breaking high-temperature events will be more frequent. To estimate the scope of the impact of record-breaking events under different scenarios, we first calculated the fraction of the population/area in CA for which the TNX3day record defined during the historical period (1961â€“2005) was broken in any given year, and then smoothed it by the 21-year running mean. Approximately 51%/52% (72%/71%) of the population/area in CA will break the historical TMX3day (TNX3day) record under the INDC scenario, respectively (

An approximately linear increase in the population/area fraction with the global mean warming can be observed in all regions, and the increasing rates of record-breaking nighttime hot extremes (i.e., TNX3day) are larger than those of daytime hot extremes (i.e., TMX3day).
