<p class="p">If the warming is limited to a lower level, the CA region is projected to benefit from robust reductions in extreme high-temperature events (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02661-f007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref>). Compared with the INDC scenario, the lower warming of the 2.0 °C/1.5 °C target scenarios will help to avoid approximately 44%/65% of the increase in the intensity of extreme high-temperature events (TMX3day and TNX3day), 53–61%/75–80% of the increase in the duration of extreme high-temperature events (HW and WSDI), and approximately 48–52%/69–72% of the increase in the frequency of extreme high-temperature events (TX90p and TN90p) in CA based on the population density-weighted average indices. All the subregions would experience such a significant impact reduction, although the magnitudes would slightly differ.
