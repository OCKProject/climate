<p class="p">CA will experience a remarkably higher warming rate than the global mean based on various scenarios. The regional mean SAT in CA will be 2.3 °C (1.8–2.7 °C, 25–75% interval range), 3.0 °C (2.5–3.5 °C), and 4.8 °C (4.2–5.3 °C) above the preindustrial level under the 1.5 °C, 2.0 °C, and INDC scenarios, respectively. With respect to the spatial pattern, the warming will be stronger in high-latitude areas and in the Pamir Mountains in all scenarios. The differences between the INDC/2.0 °C (or 2.0 °C/1.5 °C) scenarios are also larger in these areas (
