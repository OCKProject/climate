<p class="p">We used daily minimum and maximum near-surface air temperatures data of 32 GCMs from CMIP5 [
 <xref rid="B25-ijerph-16-02661" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. Basic information about these models is provided in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijerph-16-02661" class="xref">Table S1</xref>. Since the ensemble mean of these GCM models can filter the uncertainty due to the inter-model variability, it is the best representation of the response to the imposed external forcing. Its predictions are better than those of any individual member [
 <xref rid="B26-ijerph-16-02661" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="B27-ijerph-16-02661" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]; therefore, it was used to reflect the simulated extreme high-temperature changes in this study. We selected only the first run for the multi-ensemble models so that all the models were treated equally. All the model data were interpolated to a common 1° × 1° horizontal grid using a bilinear interpolation algorithm for ensemble analysis.
