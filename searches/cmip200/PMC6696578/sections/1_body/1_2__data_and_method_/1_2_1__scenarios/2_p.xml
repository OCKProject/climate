 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02661-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>a). To extend the INDC scenario to the end of this century, we assume that countries continue the mitigation efforts pledged in the INDC, and that the global emissions follow a relatively constant decarbonization rate after 2030. The simulation results of future emissions from 28 socioeconomic models (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) scenario database,

We selected scenarios in which the 2030 GHG emission level is consistent with the NDC (50–56 GtCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>eq/yr). Considering the difficulty and uncertainty of future CCS, scenarios with a CCS &gt;15 GtCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>eq/yr were omitted. In this study, we focused on the NDC-sustained mitigation scenario (hereafter INDC) (
