<p class="p">In this study, the INDC mitigation target scenarios based on the Paris Agreement are analyzed. The INDC scenarios are based on Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) emission data submitted by 192 countries [
 <xref rid="B14-ijerph-16-02661" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. In this study, the 165 national NDC that were submitted as of May 2019 were analyzed; the European Union member states submitted one NDC target for the whole region. The reported national emission targets range from absolute to relative base year levels or represent emission reduction targets relative to the baseline emission scenarios. We calculated each countryâ€™s future quantified emissions targets using the normalization method. For additional information on the NDC dataset, please refer to the study of Wang et al. (2018) [
