<p class="p">We estimated the global mean warming response to the NDC-sustained mitigation. Several studies provided evaluation results. For example, the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) published the ‘Emissions Gap Report’ [
 <xref rid="B19-ijerph-16-02661" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>] and hypothesized that global emissions in accordance with the INDC development would result in a global warming of 3–4 °C (probability over 66%) above the preindustrial level by 2100, and would have a more profound impact on the climate. Rogelj et al. (2016) [
 <xref rid="B17-ijerph-16-02661" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>] showed that the median temperature rise at the end of this century will be ~2.6 °C to 3.1 °C, and a stronger temperature increase is likely. The CI (2016) [
 <xref rid="B23-ijerph-16-02661" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>] reported a range of ~2.0 °C to 4.6 °C based on INDC scenarios. Wang et al. (2018) [
 <xref rid="B24-ijerph-16-02661" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>] pointed out that the INDC emissions would lead to a global mean warming of 1.4 °C (1.3–1.7 °C) by 2030 and 3.2 °C (2.6–4.3 °C) by 2100. We synthesized the results from the above-mentioned studies and assessed the corresponding potential global mean temperature rise for various emission scenarios based on 78 climate sensitivity experiments from the GCM ensemble of CMIP5 [
