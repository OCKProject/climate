<p class="p">Regarding social impacts, the projected population distributions under different shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) [
 <xref rid="B35-ijerph-16-02661" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>] were used to investigate the population-weighted changes of the extreme high-temperature indices. These SSPs describe five alternative outcomes for trends in demographics, economics, technological development, lifestyles, governance, and other societal factors. Projections of spatial population change are quantitatively consistent with national population and urbanization projections for the SSPs and qualitatively consistent with assumptions in the SSP narratives regarding spatial development patterns. These projections are produced by a parameterized gravity-based downscaling model. In this paper, we only show the population-related results estimated from the population projected for the year 2100 under the SSP2 scenario. However, the population exposures based on projections under other SSP scenarios are qualitatively similar.
