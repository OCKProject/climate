<p class="p">High-temperature events can be defined using either relative or absolute thresholds. The six extreme high-temperature indices that were applied in this study are listed in 
 <xref rid="ijerph-16-02661-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. The indices three-day warm day event (TMX3day) and three-day warm night event (TNX3day) were used as representatives of the indices defined according to the intensity, denoting several continuous days/nights during which extremely warm temperatures are prevalent. There is no universal and rigorous definition of heat wave (HW) when considering high-temperature events despite various studies, because the research regions and methods applied in the past considerably vary [
 <xref rid="B31-ijerph-16-02661" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. In this study, a HW index was defined as a consecutive period of at least three days during which the daily maximum temperature exceeded the 95th percentile of the baseline period. The percentile threshold was ≥30 °C, and HW represents the impact of the longest period of hot days. The advantage of the combination of relative and absolute thresholds is the wide applicability to diverse climatological regions [
