The dashed line represents value of 1.0, Figure S3: Regional average differences among INDC-pledge scenario and present level in (a) TMX3day, (b) TNx3day, (c) annual mean temperature, (d) HW, (e) WSDI, (f) TX90p, and (g) TN90p in Central Asia and the five countries. The box-whisker plots show the multi-model ensemble’s 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th intervals, Figure S4: The fraction of population and area in five countries where the historical TMX3day, TNX3day, and HW record defined during 1961–2005 is broken in different global warming levels. The multi-model medians are in solid lines, and interquartile ranges are shaded. The dashed black lines denote the linear trend of population/area fraction with global mean warming, Figure S5: Changes in TX90p (column I), TN90p (column II), and WSDI (column III) over Central Asia, based on multi-model ensemble mean. The differences between different sets of scenarios are labeled on the top-left. The dotted areas are statistically significant at the 5% level according to Wilcoxon’s rank-sum test, Figure S6: Changes of extreme high-temperature events avoided over Central Asia and its subregions in less warming scenarios (units: percentage). Regional average extreme temperature indices are reduced in the low warming scenarios (left—2.0°C compared to INDC pledge, right—1.5°C compare to INDC pledge). The red boxes represent the indices defined by intensity, the yellow boxes represent the indices defined by duration, and the blue boxes represent the indices defined by frequency. Central lines and bars denote multimodal medians and interquartile ranges, respectively.
