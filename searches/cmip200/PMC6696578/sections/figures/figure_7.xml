  <p class="p">Changes of extreme high-temperature events avoided over Central Asia and its subregions in less warming scenarios (units: %). Population density weighted average extreme temperature indices is reduced in the low warming scenarios (left—2.0 °C compared to the INDC pledge, right—1.5 °C compare to INDC pledge). The red boxes represent the indices defined by intensity, the yellow boxes represent the indices defined by duration, and the blue boxes represent the indices defined by frequency. Central lines and bars denote multimodal medians and interquartile ranges, respectively. For the avoid impact based on regional average extreme temperature indices, refer to
