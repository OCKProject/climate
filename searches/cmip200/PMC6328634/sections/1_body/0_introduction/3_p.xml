<p id="Par5" class="p">We address these questions here by analyzing the historical (1979–2016) and future (up to year 2300) changes in Arctic sea-ice cover (SIC), surface air temperature (Tas), and energy fluxes in ERA-Interim reanalysis data and CMIP5 model simulations (see Methods). We also perform and analyze two climate change simulations with 1%-per-year increase in atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> with and without fixed SIC in calculating surface water and energy fluxes using a fully coupled climate model (namely, the CESM1, see Methods). These models realistically simulate the mean annual cycle of SIC, Tas, and surface energy fluxes (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>), as well as the SIC distributions (Supplementary Figures 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>–
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref>). In the CMIP5 simulations, Arctic sea-ice loss rate peaks around 2070; thereafter, both Arctic SIC and sea-ice loss diminish while global warming continues, albeit at a slower pace after the late 22nd century due to reduced GHG forcing

 </sup> (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">4</xref>). This allows us to examine how the magnitude of the AA varies with changing SIC and sea-ice loss, and whether the existence of sea ice is necessary for large AA to occur. In the CESM1 simulations, a constant CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> forcing with a 1%-per-year increase is applied for 235 years during which atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> level is doubled three times at year 70, 140, and 210. These simulations allow us to examine how the AA varies over time as the SIC changes under a constant external forcing, and the difference between the 1% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> run with fully interactive sea ice (denoted as 1% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> run) and the 1% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> run with fixed SIC in calculating the surface fluxes (denoted as FixedIce run) would allow us to further quantifying the impact of sea-ice loss on AA through its impact on surface fluxes.
