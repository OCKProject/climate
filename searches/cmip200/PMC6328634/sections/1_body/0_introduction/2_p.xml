<p id="Par4" class="p">Seasonal sea-ice melting from May to September opens a large portion of the Arctic Ocean, allowing it to absorb sunlight during the warm season. Most of this energy is released to the atmosphere through longwave (LW) radiation, and latent and sensible heat fluxes during the cold season from October to April when the Arctic Ocean becomes a heat source to the atmosphere

 </sup>, which increases the absorption of sunlight by the Arctic Ocean during the warm season and its subsequent release as more Arctic Ocean becomes ice-free, thereby amplifying Arctic warming in the cold season. This process involves the seasonal storage and release of the absorbed solar radiation, thus it differs from the ice–albedo feedback over land and is not the same as just altering the surface albedo in climate models
