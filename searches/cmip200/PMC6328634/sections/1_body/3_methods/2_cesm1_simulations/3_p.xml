<p id="Par25" class="p">Our main intervention of the fully coupled system in the FixedIce run is the application of the internally calculated fluxes over a fixed sea-ice cover from the CTL run (instead of only over the ice cover existed at the time inside the sea-ice model). A secondary intervention was the use of CTL surface fluxes (instead of letting the coupler to calculate them for a water surface) over the low SIC fraction in a small number of the grid cells that initially contained sea-ice but the sea ice melted away completely. This use of the CTL fluxes was not ideal but necessary because (1) the sea-ice model did not calculate surface fluxes for grid cells without any ice, (2) the internally calculated surface temperature over these grid cells is for water surfaces and thus canâ€™t be used directly as the surface temperature for ice surfaces; and (3) the calculations of surface fluxes over sea-ice were complicated.</p>
