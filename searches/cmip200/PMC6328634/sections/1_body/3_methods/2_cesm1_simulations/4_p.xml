<p id="Par26" class="p">The CTL fluxes contained only an annual cycle and were seen by the atmosphere and ocean component models; they along should not cause any long-term trends and are balanced out on an annual mean sense when applied to the small areas where ice was melted away completely (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">9</xref>). That is, they should not violate the internal water and energy balance on an annual-mean basis, although they may slightly alter these balances on shorter time scales over the small number of grid cells (north of 30°N) where sea ice had melted away completely. This is much better than re-setting the ice cover to the CTL climatology after each time step, since that would provide an infinite source of ice for melting, leading to an infinite heat sink and freshwater source for the oceans. Our approach here focused on the effects on the climate (including sea ice itself) of a fixed sea-ice cover through its impact on surface fluxes; it differs from Deser et al.
