<p id="Par24" class="p">In the FixedIce run, the coupler and the atmospheric and ocean components in the CESM1 only saw the fixed sea-ice cover interpolated from the CTL run north of the 30Â°N; the sea-ice fraction inside the sea-ice model was allowed to evolve dynamically with the fluxes returned from the coupler. Thus, the above changes made in the FixedIce run would also affect the rate of sea-ice loss through the modification to the surface fluxes.</p>
