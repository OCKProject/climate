<p id="Par31" class="p">As the fixed sea-ice cover reduces upward LW radiation, surface net LW radiative heating increases more in the FixedIce run than in the 1% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> run in the Arctic (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">17</xref>). On the other hand, the surface LH (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">18</xref>) and SH (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">19</xref>) heat fluxes increase substantially only in the 1% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> run over the Arctic, and they partially offset the large increases in the absorbed SW radiation (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">16e</xref>) and the moderate increase in the net LW radiative heating (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">17e</xref>) over the Arctic in the 1% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> run, which results in only moderate changes in the net surface energy flux (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">12e</xref>). This differs from the FixedIce run, in which the changes in the LH and SH fluxes are small (Supplementary Figures 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">17f</xref>, 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S18f</xref>), and the net surface energy flux change (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">12f</xref>) results mainly from the reduced net SW (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">16f</xref>) and greatly increased net LW (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">17f</xref>) fluxes. These changes in the FixedIce run happened over most of the Arctic, not just over the sea-ice margins (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">9</xref>) where the control-run fluxes might be used. Thus, these changes are mainly due to the use of the fixed SIC in calculating the surface fluxes, rather than due to the use of the control-run fluxes over a few areas around the original sea-ice margins. This further demonstrates that the use of the fixed SIC, rather than the use of the control-run fluxes, is the main reason behind these differences between the 1% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and FixedIce runs. These analyses of the TOA and surface fluxes also suggest that there are no major artifacts resulting from the imposed changes in the FixedIce run.
