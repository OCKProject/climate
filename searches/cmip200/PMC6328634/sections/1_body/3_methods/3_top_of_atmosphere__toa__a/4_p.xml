<p id="Par30" class="p">For the surface net energy flux (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">12</xref>), the broad change patterns are similar between the two runs over most of the globe, except the Arctic where the fixed SIC in the FixedIce run is expected to reduce the absorbed SW radiation, upward LW radiation, and surface sensible (SH) and latent (LH) heat fluxes in comparison with the 1% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> run (see Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref> and Supplementary Figures 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">19</xref>). These reductions in upward fluxes lead to higher downward net energy fluxes in the FiexedIce run than in the 1% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> over the Arctic Ocean (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">12</xref>). Further examination revealed that surface downward SW radiation is reduced over the Arctic due to increased cloudiness in both simulations (Supplementary Figures 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">14,</xref>
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">15</xref>); however, due to reduced sea-ice cover in the 1% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> run (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">13</xref>), surface absorbed SW radiation is actually increased despite the decreased downward SW radiation in this run (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">16a, b, e</xref>). Because of the use of ice–albedo from fixed SIC in calculating the SW flux, the reduced downward SW radiation leads to decreased absorbed SW radiation in the FixedIce run (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">16b, d, f</xref>).
