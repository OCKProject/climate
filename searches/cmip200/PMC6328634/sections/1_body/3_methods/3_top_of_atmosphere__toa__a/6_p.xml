<p id="Par32" class="p">Please note that we have provided several lines of evidence, besides using the 1% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> minus FixedIce difference, to support our conclusion that sea-ice loss is necessary for large AA to occur. These include the diminishing AA in the 23rd century in the CMIP5 models (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>) and in the CESM1 standard 1% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> run (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7d</xref>) when Arctic sea-ice melting becomes small. Another evidence is the strong correlation between Arctic sea-ice loss and the AA among the 38 CMIP5 models during the 21st century (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>), and the spatial and seasonal relationship between Arctic warming and sea-ice loss (and the associated surface energy flux changes). Thus, while the results from the FixedIce experiment provide a strong confirmation of the essential role of sea-ice loss, they represent only one of the several lines of evidence presented in the paper.
