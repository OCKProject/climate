<p id="Par29" class="p">To examine the spatial patterns, we compare the change patterns between the two runs for the TOA and surface net energy fluxes in Supplementary Figures 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">11</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">12</xref>, respectively. Again, the TOA flux changes are similar in the two runs, with noticeably higher downward TOA net fluxes over most of the Arctic Ocean in the 1% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> run (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">11e</xref>) than in the FixedIce run (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">11f</xref>) at the time of the 3rd CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> doubling (mainly due to increased absorption of solar radiation in the 1% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> run), except over the areas with large SIC decreases in the FixedIce run by the 3rd CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> doubling (see Supplementary Figures 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">11,</xref>
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">13</xref>). Examination of the changes in the outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) and TOA net shortwave (SW) radiation (not shown) revealed that the increase in the Arctic TOA net flux is mainly due to the large increase in the absorbed SW radiation that exceeds the increase in OLR in the 1% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> run, while it is mainly due to the reduced OLR (as surface upward LW radiation is reduced) as the albedo and thus SW changes are small in the FixedIce run. Thus, these TOA flux changes are expected physically based on the imposed the changes.
