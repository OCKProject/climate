The surface warming pattern and magnitude from 1970 to 1999 and from 2070 to 2099 are comparable between the 38-model ensemble mean and the 9-model ensemble mean, suggesting that the 9-model ensemble is a reasonable representation of the larger CMIP5 model ensemble. The recent mean annual cycles of the SIC and surface energy fluxes from the 9-model ensemble (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">5a</xref>) are comparable with the 38 CMIP5 models (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1b</xref>) and ERA-40 reanalysis data

They were then averaged over the models (one simulation for each model) with equal weighting to create the ensemble mean, whose long-term changes were analyzed here to represent the response to future external forcing under the RCP8.5 scenario. Thus, the analyses presented here focus on the GHG-forced long-term response, not the short-term variations and decadal changes caused by internal climate variability that is a major component in recent observed changes

 </sup>. Also, we did not examine the causes of sea-ice loss; but for the ensemble mean, the sea-ice retreat is primarily associated with GHG-induced surface warming: as the near-surface temperature increases to above the freezing point for a given month, sea ice starts to melt away (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">8</xref>). Thus, the warming triggered by the increasing GHGs and enhanced by water vapor and other feedbacks (including the warming due to sea-ice loss) is the main cause of the sea-ice loss.
