<p id="Par21" class="p">We conclude that sea-ice loss is necessary for large AA to occur because it mainly results from the increased upward LW radiation and SH and LH fluxes during the cold season over the newly opened waters, while water vapor and other feedbacks can only enhance and maintain the surface warming triggered by sea-ice loss or indirectly contribute to AA by causing sea-ice melting. While increased downward LW radiation can contribute to Arctic warming, it cannot produce an 
 <italic class="italic">amplified</italic> warming over the Arctic compared with the rest of the world if there is no sea-ice loss. On the other hand, how important of the additional absorption of solar radiation (due to ice–albedo effect) during the warm season (red line in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a, b</xref>) is for the enhanced release of the LW, SH, and LH fluxes during the cold season and thus to the AA requires further investigation.
