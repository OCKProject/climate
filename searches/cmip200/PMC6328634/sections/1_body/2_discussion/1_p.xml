<p id="Par19" class="p">The seasonal, temporal, inter-model, and spatial dependence of the AA on sea-ice loss presented above, coupled with the differences between the CESM1 1% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and FixedIce runs, strongly suggests that the existence of sea ice and significant sea-ice loss is necessary for large AA to occur under GHG-induced warming, and that AA occurs primarily in the cold season due to the extra LW radiation and sensible and latent heat release from the newly opened waters, which are 10–30 °C warmer than sea-ice surfaces in Arctic winter

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref>). The results also suggest that water vapor and other feedbacks can only help maintain and enhance the AA triggered by sea-ice loss or indirectly contribute to AA by causing sea-ice melting, but they cannot produce large AA without sea-ice loss. Large AA cannot occur during the warm season because any extra heating will be absorbed by and stored in the upper Arctic Ocean, rather than being used to raise air temperature. We emphasize that enhanced downward LW radiation

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> increases) or internal processes (e.g., water vapor feedback

 </sup>) that can cause or enhance Arctic warming may contribute indirectly to AA through their impact on sea ice. However, without the LW, SH, LH, and other surface flux changes associated with the sea-ice loss (e.g., after the sea ice melts away as in past or future warm climates, or in a model with little sea-ice loss), Arctic warming rate under increasing GHGs would be similar to the global warming rate, leading to small AA.
