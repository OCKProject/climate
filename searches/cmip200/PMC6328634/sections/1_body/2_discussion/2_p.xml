 </sup> with fixed surface albedo still produced noticeable AA, in which LW_up, SH, and LH fluxes could still change as SIC declines. This further points to the key role of increased LW_up, SH, and LH fluxes associated with sea-ice loss, besides the albedo effect which occurs mainly in the warm season and thus cannot directly affect the AA, which occurs primarily in the cold season.
