<p id="Par10" class="p">During the 23rd century, sea ice forms only over a small area (&lt;20%) of the Arctic Ocean even during the cold season (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">5c, d</xref>). Thus, there is no significant sea-ice loss for most of the months except for January–May when small (3–10%) losses still occur (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3c</xref>). Because of this, absorbed solar radiation changes little, as do the surface LH and SH fluxes; while the upward LW increases uniformly throughout the year due to the overall surface warming (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3c</xref>). Without the extra heating from the ocean (on top of the mean seasonal cycle, Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">5c, d</xref>), the Arctic warming during the 23rd century shows little seasonal variation, and it is only about 40–50% higher than the global warming rate for all the months (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3c</xref>), which is comparable to the AA during the summer in previous centuries (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a, b</xref>).
