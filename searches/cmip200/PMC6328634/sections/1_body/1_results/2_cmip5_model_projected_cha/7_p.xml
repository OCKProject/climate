<p id="Par14" class="p">On the other hand, the increased LW_up, SH, and LH heating by the newly opened Arctic waters (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>) should increase lower tropospheric temperature and water vapor, and possibly cloud cover as well (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">6</xref>) over and around the areas with sea-ice loss. These atmospheric changes, triggered by the extra surface heating induced by sea-ice loss and enhanced by the local positive water vapor feedback, result in increased downward LW radiation (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">6</xref>) as noticed previously

 </sup>, which in turn helps maintain and enhance an elevated surface temperature over the newly opened waters. In turn, the enhanced warming should accelerate the sea-ice loss, leading to a positive feedback loop. The stable Arctic atmosphere

 </sup>. However, the fact that the AA becomes much smaller in the 23rd century (October–April mean Arctic to global warming ratio = 1.47) than that in the 21st (2.97) and 22nd (2.40) century (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>) suggests that the LW, latent and sensible heating due to sea-ice loss is essential for large AA to occur, while all the other processes can only modulate the sea-ice loss-induced amplification or indirectly contribute to AA by causing sea-ice melting, but they cannot cause large AA without sea-ice loss.
