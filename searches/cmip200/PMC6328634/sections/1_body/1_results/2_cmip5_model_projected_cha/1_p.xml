<p id="Par8" class="p">CMIP5 model-simulated Arctic warming and sea-ice loss vary greatly with month in the 21st and 22nd centuries, but not in the 23rd century when most of the sea ice is melted away (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). During the 21st century, large sea-ice loss (&gt;20% of the Arctic area) occurs from June to January, but large AA exists only from October to April, peaking in November–December (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a</xref>). Reduced SIC allows the Arctic Ocean to absorb more sunlight from April to August (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a</xref>), but this extra energy is stored in the upper Arctic Ocean without increasing the surface temperatures substantially due to the large heat capacity of the ocean mixed layer. This results in small changes in LW_up and SH + LH fluxes and negligible AA for the summer months, consistent with the recent changes

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">28</xref>
 </sup> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref>). This result suggests that when the Arctic Ocean is a heat sink from May to August (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">5a</xref>), all the surface and atmospheric changes (including increased LW heating from increased water vapor and clouds, Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">6</xref>) cannot produce AA during those months. However, from October to March when the Arctic Ocean becomes a heat source to the atmosphere (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">5a</xref>), the extra energy stored in the ocean is released through surface upward LW radiation, LH and SH fluxes to heat the lower troposphere, thereby enhancing the Arctic warming during these months (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4a</xref>), as LW radiation and SH directly warm the lower troposphere while LH increases water vapor and thus its greenhouse warming effect on the surface. This key role by surface LW, LH, and SH fluxes is consistent with that seen during the recent decades

 </sup> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Clearly, whether an area is covered by sea ice during the cold season makes a huge difference for these surface fluxes, and this is why sea-ice loss can greatly enhance the warming induced by CO
