 </sup>, or other processes to generate such a spatial pattern of surface warming that resembles that of sea-ice loss and then their effects disappear in the 23rd century when there is little sea-ice loss. While enhanced local warming can increase sea-ice loss and thus cause a negative correlation between the SIC and Tas change, the warming pattern itself cannot be easily explained by the LW- and heat transport-related mechanisms without a key role of the sea-ice loss. This is because the large-scale downward LW forcing (from increased CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, water vapor, or clouds) should not be correlated spatially with SIC loss unless there exists a major role by the sea-ice loss to alter the surface warming and water vapor (and thus LW) change patterns. In other words, if SIC does not play a major role, then the warming pattern should be fairly uniform (as CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and water vapor in the Arctic would be well mixed zonally by the large-scale circulation if local processes played a minimal role), or spatially correlated with cloudiness changes rather than with SIC loss. Thus, while increased downward LW radiation associated with increased CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and water vapor may play a large role for overall Arctic

 </sup> warming, it cannot produce the enhanced warming collocated with sea-ice loss and existed primarily only during the cold season that leads to large AA only in the cold season. However, a general Arctic warming, either due to increased CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, water vapor, or clouds, can indirectly contribute to AA through melting of sea ice.
