<p id="Par12" class="p">We also found a strong correlation (r = 0.84) between the Arctic sea-ice loss and Arctic-minus-global warming difference from 1979 to 1999 and from 2070 to 2099 among the 38 CMIP5 models we analyzed (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>); that is, models with a larger sea-ice loss tend to produce larger AA in the 21st century under the RCP8.5 scenario. Since the current SIC determines how much sea ice is available for future melting, this result suggests that the magnitude of a model-simulated Arctic warming and AA will depend on its mean bias in SIC (and thus also Tas) for the current climate, consistent with previous studies
