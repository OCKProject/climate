<p id="Par9" class="p">By the end of the 21st century, Arctic sea ice is largely gone from July to October (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">5b</xref>). As a result, the largest sea-ice loss in the 22nd century occurs from December to June, and the largest increases in the absorbed SW radiation are from April to June (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b</xref>). Again, this extra energy is stored in the Arctic Ocean with negligible amplification of surface warming during these months (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b</xref>). As the Arctic sea ice continues to decline during the cold season (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b</xref>), more ocean surfaces are ice-free and open to the atmosphere. Because the newly exposed ocean water is much warmer than the cold sea-ice surface existed previously

 </sup>, this allows the ocean to release more LH and SH fluxes and LW radiation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b</xref>) to warm the lower troposphere from November to March, when the ocean is still a seasonal heat source to the atmosphere (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">5b</xref>). The largest release of the extra LW, LH, and SH is delayed to January–February by the end of 22nd century from November to December in the 21st century as the maximum sea-ice loss moves to latter months (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a, b</xref>). This results in elevated Arctic warming and thus large AA from November to March, whereas the AA is small for the other months (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b</xref>).
