<p id="Par11" class="p">We further calculated the local change between two moving 20-yr periods for Arctic annual SIC, Arctic and global-mean annual Tas, and the Arctic-minus-global warming difference (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3d</xref>). Clearly, the elevated warming over the Arctic is strongly correlated with sea-ice loss (r = 0.95) for all the 40-yr periods within 1900–2300. As the Arctic sea-ice loss increases from the 1950s to the 2060 s, the Arctic-minus-global warming difference also increases; thereafter, the warming difference decreases as the sea-ice loss slows down due to reduced SIC (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3d</xref>). After year 2200, there is little sea-ice left to melt, and the warming difference is small between the Arctic and the globe. In contrast, from 1980–2020 when the global warming rate is similar to that of 2200–2280, the Arctic warms much faster than the global-mean as the sea-ice loss is much larger during 1980–2020 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3d</xref>).
