<p id="Par7" class="p">From 1979–2016, Arctic SIC has decreased considerably in all months, especially during June–November, which leads to increased absorption of solar radiation by the Arctic from April to September (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref>). However, the largest AA (defined here as the ratio of Arctic vs. global-mean Tas change) occurs from October to April, while the AA is small during the warm season, especially in July–August (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref>). The extra absorbed solar radiation during the warm season occurs over and is stored in the newly opened Arctic waters with minimum enhancement of surface temperatures as reflected by the small changes in surface upward LW radiation (LW_up) and sensible (SH) and latent (LH) heat fluxes during the warm season (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref>). From October to April, LW_up and SH + LH fluxes have increased substantially, which indicates a warm ocean surface and extra heating to the air. This leads to enhanced atmospheric warming near the surface (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref>) and in the lower troposphere

 </sup>. The November-minus-July difference in the LW_up (~4 W/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>/decade) and SH + LH (~1.7 W/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>/decade) fluxes in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref> may be attributed to the amplified ocean surface warming (due to a combination of the extra solar absorption during the warm season and the opening of new water surfaces during the cold season). Clearly, the LW_up forcing of the air is more than twice the SH + LW change, which is also the case in the model simulations discussed below. This is expected because of the large (10–30 °C) temperature difference between typical water and ice surfaces in the winter Arctic

 </sup> (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref>). Such a scenario is also supported by the close spatial collocation of the largest surface warming and turbulent flux (and LW_up) increases with the largest sea-ice loss (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref>). These historical changes, including the seasonality and spatial patterns, are largely reproduced by the CMIP5 models (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b</xref>). Because the CMIP5 multi-model ensemble mean represents mostly externally forced changes

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">41</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">42</xref>
 </sup>, this result suggests that these historical Arctic changes are mostly forced by CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and other external forcing. It also implies that the CMIP5 models may be capable of simulating the Arctic responses to CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and other greenhouse gas changes under future forcing scenarios.
