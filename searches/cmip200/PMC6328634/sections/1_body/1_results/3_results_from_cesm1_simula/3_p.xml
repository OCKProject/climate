<p id="Par17" class="p">When a constant sea-ice cover is used in computing the surface fluxes, Arctic sea-ice loss is greatly reduced (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8a–c</xref>) as a result of the reduced Arctic warming (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6b</xref>). The reduced sea-ice loss contributes to small changes in surface LW_up, SH, and LH fluxes and small AA even during the cold season throughout the simulation (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6b,</xref>
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref>). The Arctic warming during the warm season is actually smaller than the global mean (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8c</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9e</xref>), likely because the CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>-induced warming is lower over ocean water surfaces than over continents, and the Arctic Ocean is essentially ice-free during the summer months by the 3rd CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> doubling. As a result, the annual-mean Tas shows very little AA even by the time of the 3rd CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> doubling (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6b</xref>). With sea-ice loss in the 1% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> run, warming in the lower troposphere is larger over the Arctic than the midlatitudes for the cold season and annual mean (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9a</xref>, c), which would reduce meridional temperature gradients in the lower troposphere over the northern latitudes and therefore could potentially weaken midlatitudes westerlies and jet stream

 </sup>. Such an effect is absent, however, in the FixedIce run (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9d–f</xref>). Thus, sea-ice loss is necessary for GHG-induced warming to alter the meridional temperature gradient and thus affect the weather and climate at northern midlatitudes.
