<p id="Par15" class="p">One concern with the extended CMIP5 simulations is that the mean climate in the 23rd century is much warmer than and likely very different from today’s climate and this may become an important factor for AA, although the seasonal, spatial, temporal, and inter-model dependence of the AA on sea-ice loss is seen during all time periods besides the 23rd century in the CMIP5 simulations. Another concern is that the external forcing and global warming rate change during the CMIP5 simulations, which may affect the AA. To address these concerns and to further isolate and quantify the effect from sea-ice loss, we performed two multi-century simulations with a constant forcing of 1%-per-year CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> increases using NCAR CESM1, a state-of-the art fully coupled climate model. The first simulation is the standard 1%/year CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> run with fully active sea ice (1% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> run), and the second run is the same except it uses fixed Arctic sea-ice cover in 
 <italic class="italic">calculating</italic> all the surface fluxes only (FixedIce run; see Methods). Thus, the 1% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>-minus-FixedIce difference represents the effect of Arctic sea-ice loss through its impact on surface fluxes, and a consistent dependence of the AA on sea-ice loss during these multi-century simulations would indicate a weak dependence of the AA on the mean climate state, as these simulations cover a wide range of atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> from 284.7 to 2950 ppm (and thus of the mean climate). Without the sea-ice loss-induced changes in surface fluxes, Arctic warming is greatly reduced while global warming weakens only slightly under the 1%-per-year CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> increase, and this results in negligible AA for annual-mean Tas during the entire simulation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). In fact, the Arctic-global Tas difference becomes negative after about year 160 in the FixedIce run (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6b</xref>). This strongly suggests that without the sea-ice loss-induced surface flux changes, no physical mechanisms can cause AA for annual-mean Tas.
