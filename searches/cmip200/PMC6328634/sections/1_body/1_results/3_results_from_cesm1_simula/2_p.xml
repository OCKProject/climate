<p id="Par16" class="p">Similar to the CMIP5 results (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>), the large sea-ice loss in the CESM1 1% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> run also starts mainly during the summer–early winter season (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7a, b</xref>), and then extends to the winter–spring season (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7c</xref>) as the warming intensifies under increasing CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. Again, the sea-ice loss and other changes do not cause large AA during the summer months throughout the simulation (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6a</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>), whereas large AA is seen during the cold season when the releases of LW, SH, and LH fluxes into the Arctic air increase (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7a–c</xref>). The changes over a moving 40-year period (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7d</xref>) also show strong negative correlation (r = −0.87) between the local SIC change and the Arctic-global Tas difference, again suggesting a vital role of the sea-ice loss for AA.
