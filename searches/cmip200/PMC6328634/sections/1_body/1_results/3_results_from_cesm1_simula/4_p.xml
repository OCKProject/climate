<p id="Par18" class="p">The relationship between local changes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8d</xref>) in sea-ice loss and the Arctic-global Tas difference becomes weaker as their physical relationship is altered by the use of a constant SIC in calculating the surface fluxes in the FixedIce run. This weakened coupling between surface warming and sea-ice loss is also seen in the spatial correspondence (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig" class="xref">10b</xref>), in contrast to the fully coupled run (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig" class="xref">10a</xref>) and the CMIP5 simulations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>), in which large releases of SH and LH fluxes are collocated with the large sea-ice loss and enhanced surface warming. Without the sea-ice loss-induced flux changes, surface warming is quite uniform spatially over the Arctic and comparable with that over the lower latitudes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig" class="xref">10b</xref>). This again implies an essential role of sea-ice loss through its impact on surface fluxes (mainly LW_up, SH, and LH) in producing a large AA.
