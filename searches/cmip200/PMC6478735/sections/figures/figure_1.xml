   <bold class="bold">a</bold> SiBCASA and 
   <bold class="bold">b</bold> JULES LSMs forced by multiple climate models (GCMs) under a range of climate scenarios out to 2300. Thick lines: multi-GCM means; shaded areas: multi-GCM spread between the lowest and the highest values; thin black lines: SiBCASA runs with individual GCMs. Horizontal black dashed lines: legacy zero permafrost emissions currently assumed in IAMs. Units: GtC.
