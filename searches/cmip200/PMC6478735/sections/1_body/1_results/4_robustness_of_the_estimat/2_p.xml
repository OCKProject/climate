 </sup>. Of the two most recent studies on the cloud feedback that were based on observational constraints, one matched closely with the ECS parameterisation from IPCC AR5 adopted in PAGE-ICE, suggesting that our climate projections are robust. The uncertainties in the permafrost models used in this study, robustness of our PCF and SAF emulators, and uncertainties in other key parameterisations such as the carbon cycle, sea level rise, mitigation business as usual pathway and economic impacts of rising temperatures are discussed in Methods and
