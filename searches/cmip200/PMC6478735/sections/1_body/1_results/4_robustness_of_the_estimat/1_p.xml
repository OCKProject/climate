 </sup>. While the state-dependencies in the planetary feedbacks require further investigations as part of CMIP6, the evidence so far suggests that apart from the SAF effects presented here, the magnitudes of the feedbacks are less likely to decrease with GMST. This implies that our estimates for the impacts of the state-dependent PCF and SAF are likely to be on a conservative side.
