<p id="Par10" class="p">Our uncertainty estimate also depends on the range of global climate model (GCM) outputs used to force the LSMs, accounting for both the structural uncertainty arising from the different GCM’s climate sensitivities, as well as the irreducible uncertainty arising from weather and climate variability. To capture this uncertainty in the PCF, both LSMs were forced with output from a range of GCMs, sampling the full range of expected Arctic responses under a given climate scenario to 2300. SiBCASA is an explicit LSM and was run to 2300 with output from five CMIP5 GCMs under two scenarios, whereas JULES was configured to run to 2300 with output from 22 CMIP3 GCMs under three climate scenarios (Fig.
