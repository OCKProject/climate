 </sup>. The method involves an atmospheric reflectivity parameterisation, which represents the effect of clouds and is based on clear sky and all sky shortwave fluxes diagnosed from the GCMs. It allows us to account for the localised changes to the cloud cover and its effect on the SAF in line with the physical interactions represented in the fully-coupled CMIP5 models (Supplementary Figure

 </sup>. We do not compute the global cloud feedback; instead, it is included implicitly in the ECS parameter in the PAGE-ICE model and is assumed to be state-independent (see the section on the robustness of the results below).
