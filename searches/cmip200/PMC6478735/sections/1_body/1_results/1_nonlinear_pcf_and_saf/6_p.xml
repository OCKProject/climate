<p id="Par14" class="p">The SAF emulator models the global SAF as a function of the GMST (Methods), reproducing the nearly monotonic decline driven largely by the Arctic sea ice and land snow components. While IAMs other than PAGE-ICE have implied unrealistic constant SAF (dashed lines in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>), which is implicitly included in the 2 × CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> ECS parameter (Methods), the SAF emulator accounts for the difference between the nonlinear SAF and its constant legacy value. It alters the governing equation for the GMST change in PAGE-ICE by adding extra terms to the total anthropogenic radiative forcing (RF) for a given climate scenario (Supplementary Note
