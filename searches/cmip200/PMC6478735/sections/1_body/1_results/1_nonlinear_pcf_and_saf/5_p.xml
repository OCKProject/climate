 </sup>. While short of the complete CMIP5 ensemble, these models sample the full range of Arctic responses as seen in the whole ensemble. Eight of the models have simulations that extend out to 2300, which is necessary to capture the nonlinear transitions in the SAF. Each model has its own domains for Arctic sea ice and land snow covers based on their respective monthly maximum extents during the pre-industrial period. The SAF, therefore, is separated into the northern hemispheric sea ice, northern hemispheric land snow and rest of the world. The components are represented as functions of the GMST rise individually for each model, at which point the multi-model statistics is established (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). The sea ice and land snow components of the SAF peak for the GMST anomalies between 0–1 °C and 1–3 °C, respectively, coinciding with the loss of the summer sea ice

 </sup> covers coupled with high Arctic insolation. However, both components decrease for higher GMST as the sea ice and land snow covers continue to decline, and eventually approach zero when the covers disappear. The plateau in the sea ice SAF component between 5–7 °C coincides with the loss of the spring sea ice
