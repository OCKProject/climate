<p id="Par24" class="p">The mean economic impact of net additional warming from the nonlinear PCF &amp; SAF peaks at just under $70 trillion (NPV until 2300) for NDCs. To put this number into context, it exceeds the estimated long-term gains from economic development in the Arctic region through transit shipping routes
