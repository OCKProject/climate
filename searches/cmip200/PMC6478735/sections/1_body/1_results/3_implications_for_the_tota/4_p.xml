<p id="Par23" class="p">When the nonlinear PCF and SAF representations are combined, the statistical mean of the economic effect of climate change increases relative to the base estimate with the legacy PCF and SAF by $16.1 trillion (1 trillion = 10
 <sup class="sup">12</sup>) for the counterfactual Zero Emissions scenario ($1288 trillion base estimate), $24.8 trillion for 1.5 °C target ($613 trillion base estimate), $33.8 trillion for 2.0 °C target ($613 trillion base estimate), $50.3 trillion for 2.5 °C target ($815 trillion base estimate), $66.9 trillion for NDCs ($1390 trillion base estimate), and by $59.8 trillion for NDCs Partial ($1702 trillion base estimate). These increases are statistically significant (5% level). We also found marginal but statistically insignificant increases for BaU ($2197 trillion base estimate), which remains the most expensive and least desirable scenario.
