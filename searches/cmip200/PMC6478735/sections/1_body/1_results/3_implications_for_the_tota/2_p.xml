 <sub class="sub">NPV</sub> for the global climate-economy system using the base PAGE-ICE model with the legacy Arctic feedbacks, and PAGE-ICE with the nonlinear PCF and SAF representations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5a</xref>). In both settings, the mean total economic effects of the 1.5 °C, 2 °C and 2.5 °C scenarios are the lowest of the seven scenarios considered, while the NDC scenarios and, particularly, the BaU scenario have much higher mean total economic effects. All the distributions have long upper tails representing a possibility of large impacts relative to the means. The tails get elongated for higher emissions scenarios and when the nonlinear PCF and SAF representations are used.
