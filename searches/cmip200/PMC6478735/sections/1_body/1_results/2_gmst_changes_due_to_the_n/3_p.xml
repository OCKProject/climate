<p id="Par17" class="p">Because the legacy value is zero, the PCF increases GMST for all scenarios (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4a</xref>). The slow response of permafrost to thaw means the change in GMST before 2100 due to the PCF is nearly the same for all scenarios except Zero Emissions. The difference between the scenarios only becomes apparent in the 22nd and 23rd centuries, with the GMST effect of the PCF becoming progressively stronger as emissions increase towards BaU. The GMST increases are virtually indistinguishable between NDCs, NDCs Partial and BaU because the marginal effect on GMST of additional CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions from the PCF drops as total atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentrations increase. In addition, the highest emissions scenarios exhaust the permafrost carbon stocks in some simulations, causing a drop in the annual CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> flux from permafrost beyond 2200. This results in carbon removal from the atmosphere through CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> ocean uptake (Supplementary Note 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">4</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref>) and causes a slight decline in the GMST effect of the PCF in the 23rd century for the BaU scenario.
