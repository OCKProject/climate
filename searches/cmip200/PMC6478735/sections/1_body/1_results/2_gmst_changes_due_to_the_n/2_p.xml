 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> shows the means and ±1SD ranges of the absolute changes in GMST until 2300 due to the nonlinear PCF, SAF and PCF &amp; SAF combined, measured relative to their respective legacy values. The GMST changes from the PCF and SAF are smaller than the underlying uncertainty in the base climate projections in PAGE-ICE with legacy constant SAF and zero PCF (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>; note the different vertical scale). However, with few exceptions, the values plotted in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> represent statistically significant shifts in the state of the climate system due to the two feedbacks at the 95% confidence level (the exceptions are listed in the Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> caption).
