<p id="Par18" class="p">The nonlinear SAF is dominated by the decrease of its sea ice and land snow components (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>), resulting in less warming and negative GMST changes compared to the constant legacy SAF (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4b</xref>). The NDCs, NDCs Partial and BaU scenarios have the largest temperature increases and greatest decreases in land snow and sea ice SAF components, and thus show the greatest negative differences in GMST. The differences are the highest for BaU with nearly ice-free oceans and snow-free land even in winter after 2200. For the Zero Emissions, 1.5 °C, 2.0 °C and 2.5 °C scenarios, there are small increases in GMST for the entire time period due to the small peaks in the sea ice and land snow SAF components within this temperature range (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Overall, the constant legacy SAF appears reasonable for low emission scenarios, but overestimates GMST for high emission scenarios according to the current generation of climate models (CMIP5), with no apparent tipping points (Supplementary Fig.
