 </sup>, although several models are set to incorporate the PCF in their next versions as part of CMIP6. Consequently, most climate policy assessments based on results from the GCMs underestimate the extent of global warming in response to anthropogenic emissions. The SAF, on the other hand, is present in GCM climate projections through the coupling of sea ice and land surface models to atmosphere and ocean models
