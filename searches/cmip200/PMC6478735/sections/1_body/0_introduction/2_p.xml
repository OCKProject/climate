 </sup>. Tipping elements are physical processes acting as positive nonlinear climate and biosphere feedbacks that, after passing a threshold, could irreversibly shift the planetary system to a new warmer state

 </sup>. They could cause additional impacts on ecosystems, economies and societies throughout the world. The risk of triggering the tipping elements is one of the arguments for adopting the ambitious 1.5 °C and 2 °C targets in the Paris Agreement
