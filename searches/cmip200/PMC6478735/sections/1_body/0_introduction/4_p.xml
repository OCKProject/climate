<p id="Par6" class="p">In this paper, we explore nonlinear transitions in the state-dependent PCF and SAF, and estimate the resulting climatic and economic impacts globally. To perform the analysis, we develop dynamic model emulators of the nonlinear PCF and SAF, which are comparatively simple statistical surrogates of the highly complex physical models. The emulators are integrated within PAGE-ICE, a new development of the PAGE09 IAM

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>). The climatic impacts focus on changes in the global mean surface temperature (GMST) and the economic impacts focus on the net present value (NPV) of the total cost associated with future climate change. We consider a wide range of scenarios: zero emissions after 2020, the 1.5 °C and 2 °C targets for 2100 and the nationally determined contributions (NDCs) from the Paris Agreement, and a business as usual (BaU) scenario. We also introduce an intermediate 2.5 °C target, which requires more mitigation than is proposed by the NDCs, and an NDCs Partial scenario with a persistent under-delivery on pledges consistent with an estimated long-term effect of the US’s withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. The scenarios extend out to 2300 to capture the effects of multiple slow physical processes including the PCF and the loss of the winter sea ice under high emissions pathways. While very long horizons like this may appear irrelevant from the point of view of the actual socio-economic processes, the well-established technological, demographic and resource constraints
