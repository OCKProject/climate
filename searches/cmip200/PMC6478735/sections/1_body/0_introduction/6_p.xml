<p id="Par8" class="p">Our results show that the PCF gets progressively stronger in warmer climates, while the SAF weakens. Both feedbacks are characterised by nonlinear equilibrium responses to warming. The PCF also develops state-dependent lagged behaviour. Compared with zero PCF and constant SAF, which are the legacy values that have been used in climate policy modelling to date, the combined nonlinear PCF and SAF cause statistically significant extra warming globally under the low and medium emissions scenarios. For high emissions scenarios, the strength of the PCF saturates, and the weakening SAF gradually cancels the warming effect of the PCF; for BaU, this takes place from the second half of the 22nd century onwards. Nevertheless, under all scenarios, the predominantly warmer future climate associated with the nonlinear PCF and SAF relative to their legacy values translates into marginal increases in the total discounted economic effect of climate change. These increases, which are significant for all scenarios except for BaU, occur through additional temperature-driven impacts on economy, ecosystems and human health, additional impacts from sea level rise, as well as highly uncertain extra impacts from social discontinuities and climate tipping elements other than the PCF and SAF. Even with the legacy PCF and SAF, emissions pathways in the range between the 1.5 °C and 2 °C targets lead to the lowest total economic effects of climate change compared to all other scenarios. Considering the nonlinear PCF and SAF makes the pathways towards the lower end of the range covered by the Paris Agreement targets marginally more economically attractive.</p>
