 </sup>, which uses CMIP5 GCM simulations for atmospheric shortwave radiation fluxes from pre-industrial conditions until either 2100 or 2300 under RCP8.5 scenario (Supplementary NoteÂ 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref>). None of the GCM variables were bias-corrected in order to preserve internal consistency of the sea ice and land snow physics in each model. The statistics of the nonlinear SAF assumes model democracy in the CMIP5 sample used (equal weights for all GCMs).
