<p id="Par45" class="p">Applying the ALL/CLR method to the transient GCM simulations produced time series for the global RF associated with the surface albedo changes. These were differentiated with respect to GMST trends over 30-year climatological windows, separately for each model, using linear polynomial fitting to obtain climatologically-averaged SAF in each year. A Savitzky–Golay filter (base period = 31 years; polynomial order = 1) was applied to obtain smooth time series for GMST and SAF. The SAF (both global total and separately for the three main components) was then represented as a function of the GMST rise individually for each model, at which point the multi-model statistics was calculated.</p>
