 </sup>. Competition of vegetation was enabled, allowing the models to determine both their initial vegetation distributions and litterfall, and the response of the vegetation distribution and litterfall to climate change. The profile of soil carbon was spun up until it was in equilibrium with the 1860â€™s climate, giving 738 GtC in the top 3m of soil. Any soil carbon in the permafrost in 1860 was labelled as permafrost carbon and traced throughout the simulation. We assumed that any part of this permafrost carbon which is emitted to the atmosphere is emitted in the form of CO
