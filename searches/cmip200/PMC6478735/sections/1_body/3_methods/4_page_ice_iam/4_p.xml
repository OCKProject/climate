 </sup> fourth, improved GMST equation using a better numerical scheme for finite analysis periods; fifth, CMIP5-based amplification factors for the regional temperatures; sixth, changes in the implementation of the regional sulphate cooling: sulphates now add to the global forcing and affect the regional temperatures implicitly through the CMIP5-based amplification factors (their RF is not included in the regional temperature equation directly due to the complexity of climatic response to regional RFs, which requires regional climate sensitivities to be introduced;
