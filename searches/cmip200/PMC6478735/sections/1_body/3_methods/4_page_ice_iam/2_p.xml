<p id="Par49" class="p">PAGE and similar IAMs do not model natural climate variability, and therefore each Monte-Carlo run is deterministic in time. This allows us to work with Monte-Carlo generated probability distributions of multiple climatic and economic parameters in any fixed analysis year like 2100, as opposed to taking averages over the 30-year climatological windows (a standard requirement for any climate model data with multiple natural variability cycles). The ranges for all the uncertain parameters in PAGE-ICE are listed in the Supplementary TableÂ
