 </sup> fifth, significantly downscaled discontinuity sector, which now accounts only for socio-economic tipping points such as pandemics, mass migration and wars, as well as possible other tipping points in the climate than permafrost, sea ice, land snow and lea level rise from ice sheets (the catastrophic loss of the ice sheets has been moved to the fat-tailed distribution in the sea level rise module); sixth, reduced tolerable temperature rise that gives no chance of a discontinuity; seventh, significantly decreased time constant of a discontinuity in line with its new interpretation; eighth, focus on autonomous adaptation as part of the Burke et al. economic impact function, with planned adaptation restricted to SLR impacts.
