<p id="Par33" class="p">The 1.5 °C and 2 °C scenarios, defined as having a 50% chance of keeping the GMST rise in 2100 below the 1.5 °C and 2 °C targets based on PAGE-ICE simulations, require extra abatement relative to RCP2.6. They fall outside the range covered by the SSPW and RCPW pairs described above. We, therefore, introduced an additional abatement rate relative to RCP2.6, the same for all the major GHGs represented in PAGE-ICE, and employed Risk Optimiser to find that it is equal to 0.24% per year for the 2 °C target and 4.05% per year for the 2 °C target scenario. Both of these scenarios overshoot their respective targets during the second half of the 21st century and imply negative CO
