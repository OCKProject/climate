 </sup>. We simulated each SSP-RCP pair out to 2300 assuming constant levels of annual emissions, constant GDP growth rates and zero population growth rates beyond 2100. Under each scenario, we ran 100,000 Monte-Carlo simulations in PAGE-ICE to perform sensitivity experiments for the climatic and economic effects of the PCF and SAF.
