<p id="Par27" class="p">We have investigated the climatic and economic impacts of two major planetary feedbacks associated with the decline of Arctic land permafrost, snow and sea ice. PCF is caused by additional CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and methane emissions from thawing permafrost, and SAF is mostly driven by increased solar absorption due to the decline of Arctic sea ice and land snow covers. These two feedbacks belong to the main tipping elements in the Earthâ€™s climate system identified by recent surveys

 </sup>. Model simulations indicate that both feedbacks accelerate the warming and are nonlinear, with the PCF being the stronger of the two, while most climate policy studies to date have assumed constant positive SAF and zero PCF, which we refer to as the legacy values. All this warrants their rigorous quantitative assessment. To perform such an assessment, we developed novel statistical emulators of the two Arctic feedbacks calibrated according to simulations results from the specialised land surface and general circulation models. The emulators allow one to study the entire parameter space, which is not possible with complex physical models, and also help establish dynamic links between highly specialized climate and economic models. We implemented the emulators dynamically inside the new integrated assessment model (IAM) PAGE-ICE, allowing us to explore nonlinear interactions between the Arctic feedbacks and the global climate and socio-economic systems under a range of scenarios consistent with the Paris Agreement.
