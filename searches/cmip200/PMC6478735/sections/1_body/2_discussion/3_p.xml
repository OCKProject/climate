<p id="Par29" class="p">The nonlinear transitions in the two feedbacks explored in this study demonstrate the pressing need for a better understanding of state-dependent processes in the Earth’s climate system, both those associated with the Arctic and beyond. This is important because triggering these and other planetary feedbacks might accelerate the pace of climate change
