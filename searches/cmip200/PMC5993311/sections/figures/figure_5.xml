  <p class="p">Total, fast, and slow monsoon circulation responses to anthropogenic aerosols. On a shorter time scale, aerosols cause a rapid cooling of the local land surface, which induces anomalous sinking motion over land and anomalous rising motion over the adjacent oceans (fast response). On a longer time scale, aerosols cause a decrease in SSTs, as well as a meridional temperature gradient with a stronger cooling in the Northern Hemisphere, resulting in anomalous sinking (rising) motion north (south) of the equator (slow response). The combination of the fast adjustments and SST feedbacks leads to an overall reduction of the local overturning circulation (total response).</p>
