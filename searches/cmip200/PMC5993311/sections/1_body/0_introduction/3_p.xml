<p class="p">The most populated regions of the Asian continent are characterized by a distinct monsoonal climate, spanning from the Indian subcontinent to the extratropics of eastern Asia. The summer monsoon brings over 80% of the annual rainfall in these regions, essential for local economy, agriculture, ecosystems, and human health (Hong &amp; Kim,

 <xref rid="grl56839-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). In addition, as a major part of the summertime overturning circulation in the Northern Hemisphere tropics, the Asian monsoon has profound remote influences on the global‚Äêscale climate (Lin &amp; Wu,
