<p class="p">Over the past few years, “Asian smog” has become one of the most pressing environmental threats around the world, featuring unprecedentedly high pollution levels and severe impacts onto the world's most densely populated region. According to a study conducted by the Global Burden of Disease from Major Air Pollution Sources (GBD MAPS) Working Group, ambient fine particular matter (

Aerosols can affect global and regional climate by altering the radiation budget and interacting with clouds through microphysical processes, thereby causing subsequent changes in surface temperature as well as the hydrological cycle (Allen &amp; Ingram,
