<p class="p">Here we examine the Asian summer (June–August seasonal mean, JJA) monsoon response to anthropogenic aerosols on different time scales, with a focus on the fast adjustments independent of SST changes. We analyze the physical mechanisms of the total and fast responses and discuss the possible role of SST feedbacks. We address the question by using a suite of coupled general circulation models (CGCMs) in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project—Phase 5 (CMIP5), and AGCMs with prescribed aerosol concentration and SSTs. Model simulations and analysis methodology are provided in section
