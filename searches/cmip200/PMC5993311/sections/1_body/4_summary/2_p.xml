<p class="p">Using multiple CGCMs and idealized AGCM experiments, we have identified the physical mechanisms of the total and fast monsoon responses to aerosol forcing. The single‐forcing model simulations and the AGCM approach, although highly idealized, provide an effective way to separate the physical processes driving the aerosol‐induced monsoon responses on different time scales, essential for furthering the mechanistic understanding and reducing the uncertainties related to aerosol‐forced changes. Our results show that the fast adjustment that occurs before surface temperature adjusts to the forcing largely explains the total reduced rainfall over the major land regions, dominated by changes in atmospheric circulation. However, this rainfall suppression over land is largely absent in models where indirect aerosol interaction with clouds is not included. This is similar to the findings for the total aerosol‐induced response in Guo et al. (
