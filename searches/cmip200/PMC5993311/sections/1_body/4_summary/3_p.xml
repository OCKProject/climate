<p class="p">We have proposed possible physical pathways by which aerosols impact the local overturning circulation on different time scales. Unlike GHGs with competing effects in the fast and slow responses which lead to an overall weak circulation response (Li &amp; Ting,

 <xref rid="grl56839-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>), both the fast and slow responses to aerosol forcing cause an anomalous overturning circulation, however, centered around different latitudes. Both the land‐ocean asymmetry and meridional temperature gradient are key factors in determining the aerosol‐induced circulation responses. On the other hand, the possible competing effects of the fast and slow responses at the land‐ocean boundary where multiple physical processes are entangled may contribute to a higher level of uncertainty. It is also unclear whether the SST feedbacks are dominated by the overall aerosol‐induced cooling, the global meridional temperature gradient, or the regional SST pattern, which will be addressed in a subsequent study through further idealized AGCM experiments.
