 <xref rid="grl56839-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>. On a shorter time scale without the mediation of SSTs, the addition of anthropogenic aerosols in the atmosphere causes a rapid cooling of the local land surface, which induces anomalous sinking motion over land and anomalous rising motion over the adjacent oceans (fast response). On a longer time scale, aerosol forcing further causes a decrease in SSTs, while also inducing a meridional temperature gradient with a stronger cooling in the Northern Hemisphere due to asymmetry in aerosol emissions between the two hemispheres. Based on the weak temperature gradient approximation, horizontal temperature gradients are small in the tropical atmosphere due to the weak Coriolis effect near the equator (Sobel et al., 
 <xref rid="grl56839-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>). As a consequence, an anomalous cross‐equatorial upper tropospheric flow occurs to offset the hemispheric temperature and energy imbalance, resulting in anomalous sinking (rising) motion north (south) of the equator (slow response). The combination of the fast adjustments and SST feedbacks, involving competing effects at 0
