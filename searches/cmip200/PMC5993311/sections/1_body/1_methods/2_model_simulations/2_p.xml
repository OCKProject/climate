<p class="p">To examine the effect of aerosol forcing, we used multiple model simulations including both CGCMs and AGCMs. For CGCMs, we used output from CMIP5 models (Taylor et al., 
 <xref rid="grl56839-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>) under the historical aerosol‐only scenario, with monthly data from 1861 to 2005. The total response is quantified using the climatological difference between 1981–2005 and 1861–1885. To examine the fast response, we used idealized AGCM simulations with prescribed SST and sea ice concentration that are part of the CMIP5 archive. The control simulation (called “sstclim” in the CMIP5 archive) uses fixed climatological SST and sea ice concentration from the preindustrial control simulation, and preindustrial anthropogenic aerosols. The forced experiment (“sstclimAerosol” in the CMIP5 archive) uses the same SST and sea ice as the control simulation but with year 2000 aerosols from the CMIP5 historical simulations. The 30 year climatological difference between the forced and control simulations quantifies the fast response, thus independent of SST changes.
