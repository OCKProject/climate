<p class="p">What is the monsoon rainfall response to anthropogenic aerosols and how much can it be explained by the fast adjustment? Figures 
 <xref rid="grl56839-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>a and 
 <xref rid="grl56839-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>b show the summertime precipitation change to aerosol forcing for (a) total and (b) fast responses, using MMMs of CGCMs and AGCMs, respectively. The total response (Figure 
 <xref rid="grl56839-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>a) displays a strong drying pattern, consistent with Li et al. (
 <xref rid="grl56839-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) using a larger ensemble set of 35 models. This drying pattern in the coupled models is largely reproduced by the AGCMs without the SST feedbacks (Figure 
 <xref rid="grl56839-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>b), particularly over eastern China and northern India. On the other hand, between 0
 <sup class="sup">∘</sup> and 20
 <sup class="sup">∘</sup>N over the oceanic regions as well as southern India, the fast response (Figure 
 <xref rid="grl56839-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>b) shows a wetting trend that opposes the total response (Figure 
 <xref rid="grl56839-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>a). The similarity between Figures 
 <xref rid="grl56839-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>a and 
 <xref rid="grl56839-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>b to the north of 20
 <sup class="sup">∘</sup>N indicates that the fast adjustments dominate the monsoon rainfall response over the majority of the land regions, with an even stronger drying than the total response over eastern China.
