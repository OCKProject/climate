<p class="p">It should be noted that the total and fast responses are not precisely comparable due to the differences of both model setting and aerosol forcing. The fast response is quantified using idealized AGCMs without the coupling to the ocean, which differs from the fully coupled model used in the total response. Furthermore, the aerosol forcing corresponding to these two responses are slightly different since the CGCMs are transient runs in which the aerosol forcing changes with time, whereas the AGCMs have fixed aerosol forcing. As shown in Figures

However, it should be noted that the differences between the AOD patterns, particularly over Europe, may cause remote influences on the Asian monsoon (Bollasina et al.,
