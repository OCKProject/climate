<p class="p">The overall drying in the total response and the meridional land‐ocean dipole structure in the fast response are largely robust using a larger set of available models (Figure 
 <xref rid="grl56839-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref>). Separating the models with and without a fully interactive aerosol scheme further shows that the aerosol indirect effects (aerosol‐cloud interactions) dominate both the total and fast responses, particularly in the fast response which indicates almost no signal over land in models without fully interactive aerosols (Figure 
 <xref rid="grl56839-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref>). Among the five common models, the one model with semiinteractive aerosols (IPSL‐CM5A‐LR) shows much weaker responses compared to the other models with fully interactive aerosols (Figures 
 <xref rid="grl56839-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="grl56839-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S3</xref>).
