<p class="p">We focus here on 3‐day events as a proxy for potential flood risk (Kunkel et al.,

The 3‐day accumulated GPCC grid cell average precipitation associated with each of these events (each a record in its local region during the observed period) are listed in

The 1° resolution (also typical of the CMIP5 models) represents a scale of roughly 100 km within the contiguous United States, though clearly there may be significant heterogeneity at finer scale. As such, it is expected that rain gauge precipitation records may be substantially greater than those in
