<p class="p">Our goal is to boost the sample of annual maximum precipitation values to increase confidence in the estimates of events of up to 1,000‚Äêyear return values. In order to be able to make any such statement, a comparable number of sample years must be considered. We thus propose a novel spatial clustering algorithm which uses a traditional interpoint distance metric (Singh et al., 
 <xref rid="grl58819-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>) but ensures each cluster has greater than or equal to a specified number of elements. As well as the extreme precipitation characteristics, we also seek to consider sites which have similar general precipitation characteristics to increase the confidence that extreme precipitation events within each cluster represent similar processes. Hence, we also incorporate a measure of physical distance, fraction of dry days, and mean precipitation into the distance metric. It was found in the development of the algorithm that this additional information helped to distinguish between regions where maximum precipitation events are associated, for example, with intense convective storms (as in the U.S. Mountain West) or with large scale synoptic events (as in the Pacific Northwest). Using only the information about extreme events was found to produce less coherently clustered regions (see
