<p class="p">For a given return period, we use the fitted GEVs to assess what the precipitation intensity would be both for the reference time period and the chosen future time period. The difference between these values indicates the expected intensification at that return period. An extreme value distribution fitted to the GPCC data yields the expected observed historical precipitation level for a given return period. Finally, this observational value is added to the expected intensification to yield an estimate for future precipitation magnitude at different warming levels.</p>
