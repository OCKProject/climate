<p class="p">For each model, the first ensemble member of RCP8.5 has been used to represent warmer climates. The time period corresponding to the GPCC data set is 1988–2013, during which time the globally averaged warming in HadCRUT (Morice et al., 
 <xref rid="grl58819-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>) is 0.67 °C above 1851–1880 levels. Correspondingly, we select the 26‐year period where the model global moving average warming is
