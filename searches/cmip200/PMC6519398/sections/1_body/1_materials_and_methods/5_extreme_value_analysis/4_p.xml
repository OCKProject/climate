<p class="p">A separate GEV distribution of maximum 3‐day precipitation values is constructed for each CMIP5 model, warming level, and cluster region. The fit can be used to estimate the precipitation value which would correspond to a 100‐ or 1,000‐year event in the region during the reference or baseline period in each model. The baseline period is chosen such that global mean warming is 0.67 °C above the 1851–1880 period, corresponding to the warming seen in HadCRUT in the years 1988–2013.</p>
