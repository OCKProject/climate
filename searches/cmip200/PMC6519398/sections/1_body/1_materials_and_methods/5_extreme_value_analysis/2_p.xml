<p class="p">An extreme value distribution is estimated from the GPCC data for each grid point for the entire historical period 1988–2013, and a generalized extreme value distribution (GEV) fit to the set of maximum values in the cluster provides an estimate of the return period associated with each maximum observed rainfall event. We determine the annual maximum 3‐day precipitation value between 1988 and 2013 for each grid cell in the GPCC data set for each point in the contiguous United States (note that although NOAA publishes return frequency estimates for the United States (Bonnin et al.,
