<p class="p">An interpoint distance metric is computed using information derived from the distribution of daily precipitation at the point level in the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) 1Â° reanalysis product (Becker et al.,

The algorithm is designed such that each cluster has at least 40 points, a number which was found to be large enough to result in relatively stable extreme value parameter fits: given 26 years of data in the GPCC data set, this ensures that each cluster has at least 1,040 years of grid point data (other population sizes are tested in the
