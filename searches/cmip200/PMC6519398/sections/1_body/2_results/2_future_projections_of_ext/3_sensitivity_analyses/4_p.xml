<p class="p">Finally, the parameter 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic> allows us to further coagulate regions to be more spatially contained within the larger domain. The effect of this parameter is illustrated in 
 <xref rid="grl58819-supinf-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">supporting information</xref> Figure 
 <xref rid="grl58819-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S3</xref>, which shows that a variation in 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic> over 2 orders of magnitude can result in regions which are either compact (for large values of 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>) or with more complex borders following climatological boundaries (at small values of 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>). Choosing a nonzero value of 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic> allows the method to produce regions for communication which are a trade‐off between climatological consistency and spatial coherency.
