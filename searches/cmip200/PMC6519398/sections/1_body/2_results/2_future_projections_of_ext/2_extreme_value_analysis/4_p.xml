<p class="p">We can also use this analysis to consider the expected intensity of the most extreme events which might be experienced in the future (Figure 
 <xref rid="grl58819-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>, for 100‐ and 500‐year events). We find that in all clusters, 500‐year events will become more intense in a warmer world, but some clusters show more dramatic results than others. Clusters on the U.S. East Coast show a more than doubling of the intensity of a 500‐year event, whereas the western states cluster, for example, shows less of a dramatic change in the intensity of 500‐year events.
