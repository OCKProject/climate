<p class="p">The comparison of comparable historical 100‐ and 500‐year return values from GPCC with the modeled results also indicates that model precipitation in some regions is underrepresenting or overrepresenting present‐day extremes. Models underestimate historical extremes in the clusters strongly affected by tropical cyclones (South Atlantic and Gulf Coast clusters) and overestimate in mountain regions (Southern Rockies, Chihuahuan Desert, and western states). In each case, the models are not well representing the processes generally associated with the most extreme rainfall levels.</p>
