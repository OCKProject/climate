<p class="p">Only a subset of the models considered here reaches 4 °C of warming above preindustrial levels during their RCP8.5 simulation. As such, results relating to 3 and 4 °C of warming use only a subset of four models (those starred in

 <xref rid="grl58819-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> for global mean temperatures of 2 °C or less where all the models are available. Based on this comparison, the smaller set is found to broadly replicate the mean trend in most regions. This smaller set cannot represent the uncertainty in the full CMIP5 estimate, so we report only the mean value for warming values of greater than 2 °C without showing their associated uncertainties.
