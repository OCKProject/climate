<p class="p">The sampling issue has been addressed in a number of ways, a common approach being spatial aggregation. When aggregated at a global (Pendergrass et al., 
 <xref rid="grl58819-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) or continental (Fischer et al., 
 <xref rid="grl58819-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>) level, precipitation distributions are well enough sampled in the tail to resolve the changing nature of extreme precipitation in a future scenario. However, while such scales can be informative for understanding the general characteristics of rainfall in different models or for global scale attribution statements, they are not directly useful for planning and adaptation at a regional or subnational scale. Furthermore, the physical interpretation of such distributions is complicated by the fact that large regions cover a wide range of precipitation regimes, and so the events represented are not drawn from a single distribution.
