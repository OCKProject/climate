<p class="p">Currently, climate models are the main tool the scientific community uses to make projections of future climatic conditions under changing boundary conditions. But assessing extreme precipitation risk from the presently available archive of climate simulations is nontrivial. Basic theory has long predicted (Trenberth et al., 
 <xref rid="grl58819-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>) that the most extreme precipitation events are governed by simple thermodynamic principles: Warmer air is capable of holding more moisture, and thus events which significantly deplete the atmospheric column of moisture will become, on average, more extreme in a warmer climate. However, when aggregated globally, the range of models available in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, version 5 (CMIP5; Taylor et al., 
 <xref rid="grl58819-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>) encompasses a variety of responses of extreme precipitation to warming, due in part to differences in the parameterizations in convection and microphysical processes (Singh &amp; O'Gorman, 
 <xref rid="grl58819-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). As such, a single model is unable to capture the diversity of possible changes in future behavior and thus any comprehensive risk analysis requires an ensemble approach.
