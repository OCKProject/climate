<p class="p">An alternative and potentially simpler approach to resolving the sampling issue is to use spatial clustering to identify regions which broadly share precipitation characteristics, such that precipitation events within a cluster can be approximated to be drawn from the same distribution (Gong &amp; Richman,

There have also been efforts to combine extreme value parameters and traditional k‐means clustering to produce regions of comparable extreme precipitation behaviour (Bernard et al.,
