<p class="p">In general, projections of extreme precipitation events are made for relatively short return periods in models (e.g., 20 years as in Wuebbles et al., 
 <xref rid="grl58819-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) and observations (20‐year events in Kunkel et al., 
 <xref rid="grl58819-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>, and 100 years in Mishra &amp; Singh, 
 <xref rid="grl58819-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). However, without very large ensemble sizes such as Kay et al. (
 <xref rid="grl58819-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>), there are not enough simulated years to directly estimate extreme value characteristics at some longer, policy‐relevant return intervals (such as 1,000‐year or probable maximum precipitation, which are used for design standards for dams, for example).
