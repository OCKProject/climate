<p class="p">In this study, we build on such approaches and use spatially clustered precipitation data to provide information on changing risk of extreme precipitation on a more useful scale for regional risk analysis and adaptation. Using this spatial clustering approach, we seek to characterize the magnitude of extremely rare (1 in 1000 years) historical precipitation events in each of 15 regions in the continental United States, as well as the changing probability of those events under a range of warming scenarios.</p>
