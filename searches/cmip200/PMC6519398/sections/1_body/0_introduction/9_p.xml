<p class="p">This study supports increasing calls to reframe climate change assessment to better aid in real‐world risk management, incorporating principles and techniques from the public safety and financial risk fields (Kennel et al.,

These calls highlight requests for better information on how low‐probability, high‐consequence extremes are changing and how the statistics of localized events vary as a function of global‐mean temperature increase. Quantifying such risk‐relevant metrics is challenging and often subject to limitations in data availability. This study is a first step in advancing this endeavour by proposing an approach for estimating changes in extreme precipitation at a regional scale using existing data.
