<p class="p">This study takes a step toward this goal by improving characterization of the risk of extreme precipitation. We outline a potential methodology for providing information on multicentury precipitation events at a regional scale. We present this approach as a proof of concept, given that there are uncertainties associated with free parameters in the approach relating to cluster size, cohesion, distance metrics, and assumed extreme value distribution. A formal risk assessment would require the effects of these parameters to be more comprehensively sampled and understood.</p>
