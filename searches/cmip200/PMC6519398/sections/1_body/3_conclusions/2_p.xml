<p class="p">Advances in climate science made in previous decades have enabled the community to make confident statements that the planet is warming (Gleckler et al.,

 <xref rid="grl58819-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>) and that this warming has had a detectable influence on the frequency (Fischer &amp; Knutti,

 <xref rid="grl58819-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>) and intensity of extreme precipitation (Wuebbles et al., 
 <xref rid="grl58819-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). However, there is a scarcity of information on the future evolution of the types of extreme precipitation events that would exceed the tolerances of today's infrastructure. Such information is necessary to inform policy makers, urban planners, and regional governing bodies when making decisions with the potential to avoid significant loss of life, property, or livelihood. As such, producing useful projections of exactly what individual communities should expect under climate change is an enduring challenge.
