<p class="p">While this analysis offers a useful methodology for extracting information on changes in extreme precipitation events from existing data, important questions about the direct usability of these regional projections, in planning and decision‐making contexts, remain. For example, city‐level accumulation might be significantly greater than the average of the 100‐km grid cell in which the city is located, and because there is a relatively small set of models in the archive (especially at high warming levels), our results are not a comprehensive sample of all possible future behavior. In some regions, model results might be biased because we know that some physical processes relevant to extreme precipitation are not represented in the CMIP5 models, such as tropical cyclones on the U.S. Gulf Coast. Nevertheless, there is value in operational use of analytic approaches that can at least bound the problem, delineating a planning envelope for risk assessment and providing plausible futures against which to stress test valued assets (Stern,
