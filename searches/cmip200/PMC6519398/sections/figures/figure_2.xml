  <p class="p">The changing return periods of precipitation events as a function of global mean temperature, where each subplot represents a specific regional cluster. In each plot, present‐day (2013–2017) global mean warming levels relative to 1851–1880 are illustrated by the vertical dotted line. Purple elements (solid and dotted lines and the shaded region) correspond to the frequency of a precipitation event equal in magnitude to a 1,000‐year precipitation event in the present day, while green elements correspond to the future frequency of an event equal in magnitude to the historical record extreme event for the cluster. Solid lines are the median future frequency for the available CMIP5 ensemble at a given temperature, and the shaded area spans the 10th to 90th percentiles of the distribution. The dotted lines (green and purple) correspond to the median of the subset of CMIP5 models which reach
