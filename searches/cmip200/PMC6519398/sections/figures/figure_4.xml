 <caption class="caption">
  <p class="p">The predicted intensity of extreme precipitation in various regions of the contiguous United States as a function of global mean temperature. The vertical axis in each case represents 3‐day annual maximum precipitation. Solid red and blue lines show expected 100‐ and 500‐year events, respectively, while shaded areas indicate the lower and upper bounds of the subset of models which reach 4 °C of warming. Red and blue crosses show comparable 100‐ and 500‐year historical return periods as computed by the historical generalized extreme value fit. The green cross shows, for reference, the intensity of the record observed event for the cluster. The vertical dotted black line shows the average warming in 2013–2017 as assessed from HadCRUT. Data for this plot are tabulated in supporting information Table
