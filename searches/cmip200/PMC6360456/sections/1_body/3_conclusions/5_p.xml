<p class="p">For the spin‐up of the simulated climate state when starting a simulation from an observational climatology for the ocean, centuries‐long time series of global radiation at the top of the atmosphere suggest that after about 300 or 400 years the modeled climate state in N96ORCA1 reaches an equilibrium, in similarity to other coupled climate models (Banks et al.,

 <xref rid="jame20790-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). An initial loss of heat from the ocean's mixed layer, during the first few decades of the model simulation, is followed by a continuous ocean heat uptake—mostly in the top 1,000 m—whose rate decreases over the first two or three centuries in N96ORCA1.
