<p class="p">The near‐surface temperature in the simulated PD climate is too low in almost all regions in N96ORCA1. In the North Atlantic and adjacent regions, this exacerbates a cold bias that, to some extent, the medium‐resolution version shows as well. This cold bias might stem from the inability of the 1° ocean model to correctly represent the pathway of the North Atlantic Current; this is a typical deficiency of 1° ocean models.</p>
