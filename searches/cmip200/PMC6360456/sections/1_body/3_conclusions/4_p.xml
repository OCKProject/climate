<p class="p">In the midlatitude to high‐latitude SH it is beneficial that N96ORCA1 has a colder surface (or near‐surface) temperature because this mitigates the Southern Ocean warm bias that both resolutions of HadGEM3 GC3.1 display. In consequence, the representation of Southern Ocean climate in N96ORCA1 has smaller errors than N216ORCA025 in that, for instance, the volume transport of the ACC and the seasonal cycle of sea ice extent are much closer to observations in N96ORCA1.</p>
