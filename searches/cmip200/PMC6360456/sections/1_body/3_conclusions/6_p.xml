<p class="p">N96ORCA1 has been developed with a high degree of traceability to the medium‐resolution version N216ORCA025, meaning that any changes in the model's parameterizations are directly justified by the coarser horizontal resolution, for example, for horizontal viscosity and isopycnal tracer diffusion in the ocean component. However, there is a single exception. In N96ORCA1, not enough warm Atlantic water is transported northward into the Arctic Ocean. This leads to the water temperature being too low in the subsurface Arctic, and hence to insufficient bottom melt of sea ice, and thus to too thick sea ice in comparison with observations. This is a consequence of Fram Strait being only 12 grid points wide—as above, a deficiency that is hard to correct in a 1° ocean model. In order to obtain a realistic sea ice thickness in the Arctic Ocean, we have slightly reduced the albedo for snow on sea ice. This reduction, by 0.02, is still well within the observational uncertainty of this quantity.</p>
