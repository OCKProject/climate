<p class="p">HadGEM3 GC3.1 N96ORCA1 is a new, low‐resolution configuration of HadGEM3 GC3.1, the climate model of the UK Met Office in its current release. N96ORCA1 requires 1 order of magnitude less computing power per model year than the medium‐resolution version of HadGEM3 GC3.1, N216ORCA025. At the same time, the PD global climate is represented almost as well as in the medium‐resolution version.</p>
