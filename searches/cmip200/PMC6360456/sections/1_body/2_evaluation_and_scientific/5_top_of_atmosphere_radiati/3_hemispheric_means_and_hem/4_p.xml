<p class="p">With respect to hemispheric OLR, the evolution of NH mean OLR is rather similar in both models, with slightly higher values in N216ORCA025. The models differ more in the SH, where after 100 years, N216ORCA025 OLR is ~2 W/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> greater than N96ORCA1 (240 vs. 238 W/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>, with a central observational estimate in Stephens et al., 
 <xref rid="jame20790-bib-0064" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>, of 238.9 W/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>). The N216ORCA025 model (as shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20790-fig-0009" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9</xref>) develops a warm Southern Ocean SST bias, which is partly due to an underestimate of SH atmospheric reflectivity and an associated overestimate in surface downwelling solar radiation (i.e., simulated OSR in N216ORCA025 is ~98 W/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> compared to a central observed estimate of ~99.7 W/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>). A positive bias in SH OLR is consistent with (and also a consequence of) such a Southern Ocean warm bias. Over the NH N216ORCA025 OLR is at the upper end of the observed range (~242 W/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> at year 100 compared to a central observed estimate of 240.2 W/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>). The hemispheric OLR gradient in N216ORCA025 is therefore quite accurate but results from both hemispheres emitting too much OLR. In contrast, N96ORCA1 is closer to the central observed OLR estimates for both the NH and SH, slightly overestimating in the NH and underestimating in the SH, leading to a hemispheric gradient that is ~1 W/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> more positive than N216ORCA025 and observations.
