<p class="p">The combination of similar hemispheric OSR gradients, but different OLR gradients, leads to the difference in hemispheric gradient (NH minus SH) of net TOA radiation between the two models: −4.6 (N96ORCA1) and −3.4 W/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> (N216ORCA025), compared to a central observed estimate of −1.8 W/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>. The bulk of these errors against observations are associated with a common positive bias in the NH minus SH OSR gradient, which may have different drivers in the two models (i.e., SH atmosphere not sufficiently reflective in N216ORCA025, NH atmosphere too reflective in N96ORCA1). The more realistic (weaker) net TOA radiation gradient in N216ORCA025 arises from a weaker (more realistic) NH minus SH OLR gradient, which unfortunately results from the N216ORCA025 SH emitting OLR too strongly due to the warm surface Southern Ocean bias.
