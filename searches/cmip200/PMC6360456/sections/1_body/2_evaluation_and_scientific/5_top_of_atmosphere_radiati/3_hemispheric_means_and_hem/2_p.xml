<p class="p">Earth loses energy in the NH (Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20790-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>a, solid lines) and gains energy in the SH (dashed lines). As a consequence, an interhemispheric, northward energy transport is required (Marshall et al., 
 <xref rid="jame20790-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). In terms of TOA net radiation this NH to SH gradient is ~1.2 W/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> more negative in N96ORCA1 (about −4.6 W/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) than in N216ORCA025 (about −3.4W/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>; see Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20790-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>b). This results from (i) the SH receiving more radiation in N96ORCA1 (dashed lines in Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20790-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>a) and (ii) the NH losing more energy at TOA (full lines in Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20790-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>a) in N96ORCA1. To evaluate the hemispheric gradients of TOA radiation and better understand the cause of differences between the two models, we look at the hemispheric components and gradients of both OSR and OLR.
