 <sub class="sub">p</sub> = 0.293; Stephens et al., 
 <xref rid="jame20790-bib-0066" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Both models show a decrease in planetary albedo, with the N216ORCA025 model consistently lower by ~0.5%. A significant fraction of this trend in planetary albedo can be attributed to decreases in surface albedo, associated with loss of sea ice and snow cover due to the positive net TOA radiation balance in both simulations. This decrease is greater in N216ORCA025, mainly due to a greater decrease in the SH associated with the surface ocean warm bias in that model. Considering hemispheric albedos, the NH surface albedos (Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20790-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>d) are quite similar in both models, while the NH planetary albedo is clearly higher in N96ORCA1. This is consistent with the N96ORCA1 NH OSR being 1–2 W/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> greater than in N216ORCA025 (Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20790-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>e) and suggests the OSR difference is primarily due to atmospheric (i.e., cloud‐aerosol‐solar radiation) differences between the two models.
