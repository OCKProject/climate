<p class="p">As with OLR, global mean OSR also shows opposite initial trends between N96ORCA1 (increasing over the first 20–40 years) and N216ORCA025 (decreasing over the same period). The increase in N96ORCA1 is associated with an increase in sea ice cover during this adjustment period, as the ocean loses heat (cools). This is seen in the increase in surface albedo in that model (Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20790-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>c), which primarily occurs in the NH (Arctic sea ice increasing, Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20790-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>d). The inverse (negative) OSR trend in N216ORCA025 is connected to a rapid decrease in surface albedo (Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20790-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>), with this primarily occurring in the Southern Hemisphere (SH; Antarctic sea ice loss) as a consequence of the warm SST bias in N216ORCA025 over the Southern Ocean. After this adjustment period, both models exhibit a gradual decrease in OSR, again associated with a decrease in surface albedo, with the trend being stronger in N216ORCA025, primarily in the SH.
