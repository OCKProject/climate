 <xref rid="jame20790-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>c show the evolution of TOA outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) and outgoing shortwave radiation (OSR) in the two models. While both start from almost identical initial states, they quickly diverge in terms of global mean OLR. In N96ORCA1 OLR initially drops during the first 20–40 years, as the ocean mixed layer cools relative to its initial conditions. After this adjustment, OLR slowly increases in N96ORCA1 in line with a gradual increase in global mean SST (see Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20790-fig-0010" ref-type="fig" class="xref">10</xref>), stabilizing after ~400 years. In contrast, the N216ORCA025 model does not show an initial drop in OLR (and a much smaller drop in global mean SST; see Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20790-fig-0010" ref-type="fig" class="xref">10</xref>); rather, there is an immediate increase in OLR. This different behavior over the first ~20–40 simulation years is due to the rapid development of a warm upper ocean/SST bias in the N216ORCA025 model across the Southern Ocean, with spatial mean SSTs increasing by ~1.3 °C in the first 30 years of simulation (not shown). This results in a dipolar pattern in SST biases (relative to observations), warm over the Southern Ocean balancing cold elsewhere with respect to global mean values and, therefore, no initial adjustment in either global mean SST or OLR. There is a tendency for the Southern Ocean surface to also warm in N96ORCA1 but at a significantly slower rate than N216ORCA025. By year 30, N96ORCA1 Southern Ocean mean SSTs are 0.3 °C warmer than the initial conditions and 1 °C cooler than N216ORCA025. In terms of global mean SST, the weaker Southern Ocean warming in N96ORCA1 does not balance the cooling SST trend over the rest of the globe and an adjustment of global mean SST and OLR does occur. Beyond the first ~40 years, both models exhibit a gradual increase in global mean OLR. There is a suggestion that the N216ORCA025 OLR stabilizes around year 275, at a value of ~242 W/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>, although the period of stable OLR is too short to be conclusive. What is clear is that the apparent stabilization of net TOA radiation from year ~150 onward in N216ORCA025 is not a result of the TOA radiation components stabilizing but rather due to near cancellation of opposite signed trends in global mean OLR and OSR.
