<p class="p">A continuous decrease in sea ice (and therefore planetary albedo) is expected in a coupled simulation using continuous year 2000 forcing, as this model will have a positive net TOA radiation balance (as seen in Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20790-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). It is for this reason we use the period 50–100 years into the respective simulations to compare against observations. This period is after the initial ocean mixed layer adjustment (in N96ORCA1) but early enough in the simulation so the integrated forcing of the model will be similar to that experienced by the real climate system during the period ~1980 to 2010, when the bulk of observations have been made. Over the first 50–100 years of the two simulations OLR and OSR are within the uncertainty range of observations in Loeb et al. (

 <xref rid="jame20790-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) suggesting the model experiences a radiative forcing representative of recent decades.
