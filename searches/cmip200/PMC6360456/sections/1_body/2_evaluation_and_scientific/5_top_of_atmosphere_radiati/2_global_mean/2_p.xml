<p class="p">We begin by considering the time‚Äêdependent global and hemispheric radiation balance on centennial time scales, including surface and planetary albedo. Since our simulations have a continuous year 2000 forcing, these time series are not meant to reproduce observed variability. Rather, we believe that this analysis is instructive to understand the evolving and differing biases in N96ORCA1 and N216ORCA025.</p>
