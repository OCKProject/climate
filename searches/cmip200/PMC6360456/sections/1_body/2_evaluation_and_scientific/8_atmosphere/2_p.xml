<p class="p">For the evaluation of the atmospheric component of N96ORCA1, we compare 50‐year means (years 50 to 100) against the equivalent from N216ORCA025, as in the previous sections. In the troposphere, N96ORCA1 is generally somewhat colder than N216ORCA025 (Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20790-fig-0016" ref-type="fig" class="xref">16</xref>). Akin to the SST (Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20790-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>), this leads to a cold bias in the NH, while the warm bias in the SH is much smaller in N96ORCA1. At tropopause levels, it is again N96ORCA1 that is colder, by ~1 K.
