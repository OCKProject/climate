<p class="p">For global mean precipitation, the largest biases are in the region of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. The geographical pattern of the biases is mostly resolution independent (Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20790-fig-0017" ref-type="fig" class="xref">17</xref>). Because of a misrepresentation of the position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone and its seasonal cycle, some tropical regions are too dry (equatorial Pacific, northern tropical Atlantic and Africa, and the Indian subcontinent) while others are too wet (western tropical Pacific and western tropical South America). Some of the equatorial dry biases are stronger in N96ORCA1 (Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20790-fig-0017" ref-type="fig" class="xref">17</xref>b). The annual global mean precipitation in N96ORCA1 is 3.07 mm/day (3.13 mm/day in N216ORCA025 or 2% more). These values are somewhat too large compared with observational estimates that tend to be just below 3.0 mm/day (Behrangi et al.,

 <xref rid="jame20790-bib-0074" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). This excess global mean precipitation is a long‐standing issue with the UM and other global atmospheric models (Collins et al., 
 <xref rid="jame20790-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). Indeed, several of the regional annual mean precipitation biases found in N96ORCA1 are common to CMIP5 climate models in the ensemble average (Flato et al., 
 <xref rid="jame20790-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>), for instance, the biases over the oceans mentioned above, the dry bias over the Indian subcontinent, or the dry‐wet dipole over Siberia.
