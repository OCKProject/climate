<p class="p">As an indicator for the representation of land surface processes in N96ORCA1, we use the volumetric soil moisture. Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20790-fig-0018" ref-type="fig" class="xref">18</xref> shows a comparison for the NH summer between the 50‐year mean from the two resolutions and the remotely sensed soil moisture (1996–2015 average) from the combined ESA‐CCI product (Dorigo et al., 
 <xref rid="jame20790-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>; Gruber et al., 
 <xref rid="jame20790-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>; Liu et al., 
 <xref rid="jame20790-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Both resolutions capture the global patterns reasonably well (for instance, dry Sahara and wet NH midlatitudes) while they span a wider range of values than the observations: the dry regions are drier and the wet regions wetter than in the ESA‐CCI data. The N96ORCA1 simulation appears to have slightly wetter soil (Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20790-fig-0018" ref-type="fig" class="xref">18</xref>c), mostly where the simulations show a too high soil moisture to begin with. We suspect that differences in precipitation (cf. Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20790-fig-0017" ref-type="fig" class="xref">17</xref>) rather than systematic differences in the land‐surface model are responsible. While most of the wettest regions in the tropics are masked out in the ESA‐CCI data (because of the high cloud cover), the overestimation of high soil moisture is manifest in Southeast Asia and in midlatitude South America. It is likely that this is a result of the excess precipitation in these regions (Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20790-fig-0017" ref-type="fig" class="xref">17</xref>).
