<p class="p">The gross primary productivity of the land‐based ecosystems, in the global total (carbon), is 119 ± 6 Pg/year in a recent observation‐based estimate (Jung et al., 
 <xref rid="jame20790-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). As simulated by JULES in N96ORCA1, it is 111.1 Pg/year, slightly below the observed value. This might be related to the low soil moisture in some subtropical regions discussed above. In the N216ORCA025 simulation, it is even lower (102.0 Pg/yr), possibly related to the lower soil moisture.
