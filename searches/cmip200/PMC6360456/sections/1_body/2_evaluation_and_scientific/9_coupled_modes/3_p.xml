<p class="p">A selection of ENSO metrics describing model performance is shown in Table 
 <xref rid="jame20790-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>. These can be compared with Table 3 of Williams et al. (
 <xref rid="jame20790-bib-0075" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>) for recent HadGEM3 configurations and Bellenger et al. (
 <xref rid="jame20790-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) for CMIP3 and CMIP5 models. The amplitude of SST variability (M1 and M2) is well reproduced for central and central east equatorial Pacific regions although the phase locking of the signal to be at a maximum in early boreal winter and a minimum in spring (M4) is a little weak compared with observations. The variance of precipitation in the west Pacific (M5), which gives an indication of the impact on the large‐scale circulation, is reasonable. A key mean state difference between N96ORCA1 and N216ORCA025 is the annual mean equatorial cold bias evident in N96ORCA1 (Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20790-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>), a bias common to many climate models. There is also an enhanced warm bias in the far eastern Pacific in N96ORCA1—note that these two biases cancel for the Niño3 region (M6). In addition, N96ORCA1 also has overly strong easterlies in the west Pacific (M7). Overall, N96ORCA1 compares favorably with CMIP5 models.
