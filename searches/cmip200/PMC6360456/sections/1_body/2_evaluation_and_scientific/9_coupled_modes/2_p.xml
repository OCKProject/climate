<p class="p">El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the largest natural mode of interannual climate variability in the tropics; oscillations between warm and cold phases occur on a 3‐ to 7‐year time scale, and the effects are felt worldwide. A realistic simulation of ENSO is an important goal for climate models. Power spectra for the central east Pacific region, Niño3, for three 100‐year time slices of N96ORCA1 PD and observations show that the model has broadly the correct dominant frequencies, although there may be slightly more power in the 2‐ to 3‐year time scale than observed (Figure
