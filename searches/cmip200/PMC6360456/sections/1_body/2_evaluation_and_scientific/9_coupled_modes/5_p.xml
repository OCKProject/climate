 <xref rid="jame20790-fig-0020" ref-type="fig" class="xref">20</xref>a shows the AMV index from the N96ORCA1 PD simulation, with the first 80 years removed because of the spin‐up behavior. The power spectrum of the diagnosed AMV time series (Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20790-fig-0020" ref-type="fig" class="xref">20</xref>b) displays significant peaks with respect to a theoretical AR(1) spectrum at frequencies of approximately 0.017 ≈ 1/60 year
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and 0.3 ≈ 1/3 year
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. In a power spectrum from the observational data set HadISST (Buckley and Marshall, 
 <xref rid="jame20790-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>; Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20790-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>b), these two peaks are at similar frequencies (1/70 and 1/2.3 year
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>). This suggests that, in spite of the cold SST bias in the Atlantic discussed above, the N96ORCA1 PD simulation realistically captures large‐scale coupled atmosphere‐ocean Atlantic variability while acknowledging that some of the observed variability may be forced, as opposed to the simulations. This is an improvement compared to a selection of CMIP5 models (Kavvada et al., 
 <xref rid="jame20790-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>), which showed a spectral peak around 1/20 year
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> that appears not to be present in the observed AMV index.
