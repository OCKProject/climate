<p class="p">Both the high‐ and low‐resolution models are in good agreement with the seasonal Arctic sea ice extent (Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20790-fig-0015" ref-type="fig" class="xref">15</xref>) when compared with the HadISST.2 sea ice analysis (Titchner &amp; Rayner, 
 <xref rid="jame20790-bib-0068" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). In the Southern Ocean, N96ORCA1 shows a better agreement because the Southern Ocean warm bias (Williams et al., 
 <xref rid="jame20790-bib-0075" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>) is less severe than at high resolution (cf. section 
 <xref rid="jame20790-sec-0007" ref-type="sec" class="xref">3.2</xref>). The sea ice volume in N96ORCA1 is larger than in N216ORCA025 (Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20790-fig-0015" ref-type="fig" class="xref">15</xref>). In the Antarctic this is solely associated with the greater ice extent, whereas in the Arctic the thicker ice means that more ice survives the summer melt season becoming thicker multiyear ice.
