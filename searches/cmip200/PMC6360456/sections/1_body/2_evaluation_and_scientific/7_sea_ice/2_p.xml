<p class="p">Sea ice thickness and concentration directly respond to local forcing, including atmospheric and oceanic heat transport. The heat transport of Atlantic water through the Fram Strait determines the Arctic Ocean temperature in the top 300 m. Warm water at this depth can influence the sea ice through the ocean‐to‐ice heat flux which in turn can moderate the basal growth in winter (Keen et al., 
 <xref rid="jame20790-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). The Fram Strait heat transport in HadGEM3 GC3.1 varies with ocean model spatial resolution, since (a) Fram Strait is only 12 grid points wide in NEMO ORCA1 (Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20790-fig-0014" ref-type="fig" class="xref">14</xref>a); and (b) NEMO ORCA1 uses a parameterization for mesoscale eddies (see section 
 <xref rid="jame20790-sec-0002" ref-type="sec" class="xref">2</xref>), as opposed to NEMO ORCA025. This parameterization tends to smooth out ocean fronts and so reduces the flow through straits (Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20790-fig-0014" ref-type="fig" class="xref">14</xref>). The Fram Strait heat transport in ORCA025 varies interannually in the range 26–49 TW, in good agreement with the observationally derived value of 28–46 TW (Schauer et al., 
 <xref rid="jame20790-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>). However, the equivalent ORCA1 heat annual mean transport is 3–5 TW, which, being a factor 10 smaller, results in colder Arctic waters year‐round. As a consequence the winter mixed layer entrainment of deeper warm water will not result in warmer water in contact with the ice, and in spring the onset of enhanced basal melt will be absent, both effects causing annual mean ice to be thicker than observed.
