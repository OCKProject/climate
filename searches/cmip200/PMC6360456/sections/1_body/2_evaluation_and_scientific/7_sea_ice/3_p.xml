<p class="p">To compensate for the lack of basal melt, the surface albedo of snow covered ice is reduced from 0.98 to 0.96 in the visible spectral band and from 0.70 to 0.68 in the near infrared spectral band. The albedo reduction of 0.02 balances the desired effect in the Arctic Ocean with a tendency toward increased ocean heat uptake. Such an albedo reduction allows a slightly earlier onset of snow melt and subsequently longer sea ice melt season. A greater summer melt can thus offset the reduced basal sea ice melt to match the observed Arctic sea ice thickness. The values of snow albedo, in both model resolutions, lie within the observational uncertainty.</p>
