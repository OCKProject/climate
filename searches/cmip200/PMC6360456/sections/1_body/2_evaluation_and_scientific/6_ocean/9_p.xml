<p class="p">The strong fresh bias in the midlatitude North Atlantic, by contrast, occurs only in N96ORCA1. The full simulated SSS (Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20790-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>a) indicates a freshwater tongue extending directly eastward from the Grand Banks. This is not visible in N216ORCA025 (Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20790-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>b). It is tempting to conclude that, for this reason, this SSS bias has—directly or indirectly—the same cause as the SST bias in the northwest Atlantic discussed above. Note, however, that the SSS bias minimum is at a more eastern location than the SST bias minimum.
