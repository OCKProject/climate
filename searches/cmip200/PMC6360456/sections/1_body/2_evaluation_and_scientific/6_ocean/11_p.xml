<p class="p">The zonally averaged temperature bias (Figures

 <xref rid="jame20790-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>b) of the two models shows their different behavior with regards to ocean heat uptake. A significant ocean heat uptake is expected in PD simulations because of the positive incoming net radiation at TOA. In N96ORCA1 (Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20790-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>a), this heat is mostly found above 1,000 m depth, transported northward and eventually downward by the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC). In N216ORCA025 (Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20790-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>b), the warm bias in the upper 1,000 m is smaller, but there is a warm bias throughout the entire depth of the Southern Ocean. We suggest that this Southern Ocean deep warm bias is a result of the warm bias at the surface.
