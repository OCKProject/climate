<p class="p">For N96ORCA1, the global northward heat transport has been calculated including the contribution from the parameterized eddy‐induced transport. Nevertheless, from Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20790-fig-0012" ref-type="fig" class="xref">12</xref> it is clear that at this resolution the poleward heat transport on both hemispheres is smaller than in the eddy‐permitting N216ORCA025 resolution. In future work we will assess the reason for that.
