<p class="p">The maximum monthly mixed layer depth (MLD) is calculated from monthly mean model output. MLD indicates where water masses are ventilated and deep water is formed, both of which are also relevant for the nutrient distributions in the Earth system context. The maximum MLD occurs in different months across the globe, for instance, in the high latitudes usually at the end of winter on either hemisphere. Figures

 <xref rid="jame20790-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>b show the maximum MLD from both models, while the bias against observations is shown in Figures

 <xref rid="jame20790-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>d. There are notable differences between the two models. For N96ORCA1, in the northwestern Atlantic the region of the cold and fresh bias stands out with a too small maximum MLD. The maximum MLD tends to be too large in the subtropical latitudes on both hemispheres (including poleward of the ACC) and in the deepwater formation regions of the North Atlantic; in large parts of the Pacific (northern midlatitude, southern tropical) they are too small. In the northern North Atlantic, there is a significant difference in that N96ORCA1 has a very deep mixed layer in the central Nordic Seas, as opposed to N216ORCA025 which, by contrast, shows a deeper mixed layer in larger parts of the Labrador and Irminger Seas. This might point to different preferred deepwater formation regions in the two model versions.
