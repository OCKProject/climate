<p class="p">The AMOC has a substantial influence on the global climate system because of its interhemispheric northward heat transport (Buckley &amp; Marshall,

In line with the stronger deepwater formation in the Nordic Seas discussed above, the overturning cell extends further north in N96ORCA1. Note that the deep overturning cell of Antarctic bottom water is stronger in N96ORCA1 (&gt;2 Sv); this could be related to the Antarctic bottom water being colder in N96ORCA1.
