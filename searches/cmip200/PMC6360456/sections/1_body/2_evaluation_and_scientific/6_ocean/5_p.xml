<p class="p">There are a few distinct regional cold‐spot features in the SST in N96ORCA1. Notably the northwest Atlantic is too cold by up to 6 K. This is a known issue in ocean GCMs of 1° grid resolution (Danabasoglu et al., 
 <xref rid="jame20790-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>), probably because this resolution is too coarse to correctly represent the poleward and eastward direction of the North Atlantic Current; the current appears too zonal (cf. the central North Atlantic SST contours in Figures

 <xref rid="jame20790-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>b). On a smaller spatial scale, similar problems with representing the position of the Kuroshio and the Brazil Current are discernible in Figure

 <xref rid="jame20790-bib-0067" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>; Figure 16), indicating that the reason lies in the ocean model rather than with the surface buoyancy fluxes.
