<p class="p">For sea surface salinity (SSS) there are some marked regional biases in N96ORCA1 (Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20790-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>c), while on the global average the bias against the EN4 climatology (1995–2014 average; Good et al., 
 <xref rid="jame20790-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>) is only −0.16. The pattern in N216ORCA025 (Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20790-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>d) is very similar, notably the strong salty bias in the Bay of Bengal and the fresh biases in the subtropical Pacific on both hemispheres. To some degree, these regional biases also appear in ocean‐only, forced simulations (Storkey et al., 
 <xref rid="jame20790-bib-0067" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>), indicating that they occur independent of coupled feedbacks.
