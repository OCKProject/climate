<p class="p">The global volume‐averaged ocean temperature (Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20790-fig-0010" ref-type="fig" class="xref">10</xref>a) reflects the net heat uptake of the climate system at the top of the atmosphere (TOA; Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20790-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>a) which, after the first 150 years, is larger in N216ORCA025 than in N96ORCA1. We suspect that the different mechanisms of heat uptake lead to this discrepancy.
