<p class="p">The zonally averaged biases are smaller for salinity. In N96ORCA1, there is a saline bias in the warm subsurface layer on the NH (Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20790-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>c). N216ORCA025 is comparatively fresh in the upper layers of the high‐latitude Southern Ocean (Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20790-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>d); the relation to the Antarctic coastal current present at this resolution will be discussed in a companion paper. At both resolutions, there is a positive salinity bias in the upper 2,000 m around 44°N. This stems from a high salinity in the Black Sea whose circulation with the Mediterranean through the Dardanelles is very confined in the model geometry and more so in N216ORCA025 with its higher resolution—hence the larger Black Sea salinity bias here.
