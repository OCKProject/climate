<p class="p">Note that the cold bias in most of the low‐latitude to midlatitude Northern Pacific is very similar across the two resolutions in the coupled simulations (Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20790-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>) but is not found in forced simulations (Storkey et al., 
 <xref rid="jame20790-bib-0067" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>), pointing to resolution‐independent causes related to the coupling to the UM. The warm surface bias in subtropical regions of coastal upwelling (west coasts of South America and Southern Africa) is larger in N96ORCA1. It is likely that the representation of this upwelling is improved at higher resolution.
