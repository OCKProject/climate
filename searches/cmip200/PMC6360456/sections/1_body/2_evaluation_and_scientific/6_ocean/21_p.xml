<p class="p">The ACC is in balance with the meridional density gradient in the Southern Ocean and is partly driven by the wind stress. We show the ACC, diagnosed as the volume transport through Drake Passage, in Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20790-fig-0013" ref-type="fig" class="xref">13</xref>. For comparison, the latest observational estimate is 173 ± 11 Sv (Donohue et al., 
 <xref rid="jame20790-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>), while previous estimates could not fully and consistently assess the barotropic component of the Drake Passage transport and hence were markedly smaller, for instance, 137 ± 8 Sv in Cunningham et al. (
 <xref rid="jame20790-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>). By these measures, the ACC in N96ORCA1 is within observational estimates in the first decade or two into the PD simulation, while a small but persistent downward trend lets the ACC appear as too weak afterward. Note, however, that in past climate model intercomparisons (Kuhlbrodt et al., 
 <xref rid="jame20790-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>; Meijers, 
 <xref rid="jame20790-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) a very wide intermodel spread was found (155 ± 51 Sv for CMIP5). Seen in this light, the ACC strength in N96ORCA1 remains reasonable. In N216ORCA025, by contrast, the ACC quickly slows down to less than 100 Sv and then decreases further to about 50 Sv. This is a consequence of heat uptake poleward of 60°S throughout the entire water column (Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20790-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>), not being density compensated by a trend in salinity.
