<p class="p">A cold bias in the SST develops in the first 20 years of the PD simulation of N96ORCA1. In the global average the SST in N96ORCA1 is about 0.4 K lower than observed (Climate Change Initiative SST; Merchant et al., 
 <xref rid="jame20790-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). There is a distinct geographical pattern to this SST bias (Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20790-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>c). The cold bias is strongest in the midlatitudes of the NH, while in the Southern Ocean there is actually a warm bias of up to 2 K in the region south of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). These patterns are found in many of the CMIP5 climate models (see Figure 9.2b in Flato et al.,
