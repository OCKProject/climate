<p class="p">It is worth noting that, while N96ORCA1 has a lower SST than N216ORCA025 at all latitudes on average, the zonal mean net heat flux into the ocean, diagnosed from atmosphere‐only simulations, is roughly the same for N96 and N216 (with minor differences in the tropics and the high northern latitudes). Preliminary analyses suggest that the varying extent of the Southern Ocean warm bias may be related to a resolution dependence in the spin‐up of the coupled ocean‐sea ice‐wind system (and associated ocean heat transports in the initial 5 years of the run) into different stable states. This resolution dependence is not evident in consistent, forced ocean‐only runs, strongly suggesting that it is a coupled phenomenon. Further investigation of the Southern Ocean warm bias in our models is under way.</p>
