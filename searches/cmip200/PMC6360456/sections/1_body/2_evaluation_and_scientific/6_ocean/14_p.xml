<p class="p">The time‐depth signal of the warm bias in N216ORCA025 (Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20790-fig-0009" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9</xref>) develops in a slightly different way. As discussed above, there is more warming in the Southern Ocean, especially in the uppermost 500 m, while the warming rate in the other basins is less than in N96ORCA1. Note that the initial cooling in the top few hundred meters in the Pacific is smaller too.
