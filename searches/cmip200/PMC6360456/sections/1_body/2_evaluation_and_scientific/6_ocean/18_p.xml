<p class="p">The time series of the AMOC overturning at 26°N (Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20790-fig-0011" ref-type="fig" class="xref">11</xref>) shows that initially, especially in the first 50 years or so, the AMOC strength in N96ORCA1 is several sverdrups too low while being close to the observed value in N216ORCA025. After the first century, the AMOC is comparatively stable and close to observations at both resolutions. It is worth noting that, when comparing the AMOC as computed using the full velocity field in models to the RAPID estimate, the RAPID method may actually underestimate the full transport by ~1.5 Sv (Sinha et al.,
