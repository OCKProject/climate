<p class="p">The globally averaged sea surface temperature (Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20790-fig-0010" ref-type="fig" class="xref">10</xref>b) at the two resolutions displays the different spin‐up behavior. An initial cooling in N216ORCA025 is small and lasts for only about 30 years. By contrast, the initial cooling is stronger and much more sustained in N96ORCA1. Here the SST time series passes the PD observed value of 18.3 °C after about 200 years. The initial SST cooling (and AMOC weakening; see below) when spinning up a coupled model from an observational climatology is fairly typical for this resolution, compare HadGEM1 in Banks et al. (
 <xref rid="jame20790-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>) and the GFDL ESM2 models in Dunne et al. (
 <xref rid="jame20790-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). For the global mean SST, even the recovery time scale of about 200 years is similar across these models.
