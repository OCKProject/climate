 <xref rid="jame20790-fig-0008" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref> we find that in all basins there is a subsurface warming between about 200 m and 1,000 m depth (while extending less far up in the Pacific). This warming trend is strongest in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, and after a few centuries the deep Atlantic warms too (the warm bias being transported downward and then southward by the AMOC). In the Pacific and Southern Oceans the warming has a smaller vertical extent and a much slower rate; in both basins the top few hundred meters of ocean water is colder than in observations, with only weak trends. For the Southern Ocean, this holds in spite of the warm bias at the surface in large parts. The combination of a too cold mixed layer and too warm subsurface waters indicates a too small global vertical temperature gradient, a common feature in CMIP5 models (Kuhlbrodt &amp; Gregory,
