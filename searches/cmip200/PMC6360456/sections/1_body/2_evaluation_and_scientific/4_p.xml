<p class="p">Because the N96ORCA1 configuration forms the core of UKESM1, we will, for each model component, analyze the typical features of a physical GCM as well as circulation features particularly relevant from an ESM perspective. Part of the analysis deals with the transient behavior to understand how the two models drift from the initial conditions toward their own individual equilibrium states. The bulk of the analysis presents the average of years 50–100, after the first 50 years of spin‐up, to assess how the models represent the PD climate.</p>
