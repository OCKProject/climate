<p class="p">In the following, the analysis focuses on the comparison of the PD simulations with observational data. The alternative to using PD simulations for evaluating a coupled climate model against observations is to run a full set of so‐called historical simulations that include time‐varying forcing over the 165 years up to 2015. This exercise requires a fully spun‐up PI control simulation to be completed in advance of running an ensemble of historical simulations. At the point of documenting our coupled model, such a spin‐up and PI control run had not yet been completed. Furthermore, if a climate model is developed using historical simulations within the development cycle, there is a risk of overtuning toward the observed historical record, which includes both natural climate variability and human forced climate change. Given that models such as HadGEM3‐GC3.1 are developed primarily for investigating the future anthropogenically forced climate change, we chose to avoid this risk and allow the historical climate evolution to be an emergent property of the model rather than a tuned component.</p>
