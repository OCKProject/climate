<p class="p">The scientific evaluation of HadGEM3 GC3.1 N96ORCA1 we present here covers a long simulation (752 years) under PD forcing (2000 AD). It starts from the EN4 climatology, an objective analysis product based on observational data (Good et al., 
 <xref rid="jame20790-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>), using a 1995–2014 average. For the atmosphere and the sea ice, initial conditions from PD model simulations at the previous version of HadGEM3 (GC3.0) are used. For reference and comparison we use a PD simulation (297 years long) from N216ORCA025 with nearly identical initial conditions (Williams et al., 
 <xref rid="jame20790-bib-0075" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). In doing so, we ensure that the present paper documents the traceability between N96ORCA1 and N16ORCA025.
