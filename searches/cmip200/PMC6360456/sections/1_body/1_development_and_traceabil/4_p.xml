<p class="p">The tripolar ORCA1 grid has its north fold (the line that connects the two grid poles in the Northern Hemisphere [NH]) on vorticity points, in contrast to ORCA025 where it is along tracer points. The ORCA025 configuration as part of GO6 uses an older climatology for the geothermal heat fluxes (Stein &amp; Stein,
