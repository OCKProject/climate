<p class="p">An overview of the differences between N96ORCA1 and N216ORCA025 is given in Table 
 <xref rid="jame20790-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>. The bulk of the differences are considered best practice when changing the horizontal resolution in a coupled general circulation model (GCM). With the coarser resolution, a longer time step can be employed in both ocean and atmosphere. Concomitantly, the coupling frequency is reduced while still resolving the diurnal cycle. ORCA1's resolution is not eddy permitting. Hence, a parameterization for transport by mesoscale eddies is necessary (based on Gent et al.,

 <xref rid="jame20790-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1982</xref>) needs to use a larger coefficient than ORCA025. In addition, bi‐Laplacian viscosity to suppress small‐scale patterns is not needed, and Laplacian viscosity is used instead. The vertical resolution is the same for the two configurations, with 75 levels whose thickness increases with depth, from 1 m at the surface to about 200 m at the bottom.
