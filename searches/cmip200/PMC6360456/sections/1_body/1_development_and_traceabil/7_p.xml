 <xref rid="jame20790-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>, there are a small number of resolution‐dependent changes in the UM between the higher‐resolution N216 and the N96 used here. Apart from the longer time step mentioned above, the lower maximum wind speed in N96 means that the parameter that affects how much dust is picked up by the wind is increased slightly in N96 to compensate. In a similar vein, since at N96 fewer gravity waves are resolved, the parameter affecting the wave launch amplitude is increased slightly in N96 too.
