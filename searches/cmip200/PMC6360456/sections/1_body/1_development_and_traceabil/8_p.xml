<p class="p">In terms of computational performance, N96ORCA1 currently produces an output of about 2.3 model years per wall clock day (ypd) on the Met Office Cray using 13 nodes, or 6.5 ypd using 75 nodes (1 node has 36 cores). The UM alone requires about 85% of the nodes. Efforts to increase this performance are under way.</p>
