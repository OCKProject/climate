<p class="p">The development of HadGEM3 GC3.1 N96ORCA1 started by changing the ocean resolution of the N96ORCA025 configuration as maintained by the Met Office Hadley Centre. The NEMO ocean model (Madec and the NEMO Team,

This configuration, with minor variations, is employed by four other ESMs across Europe. In order to maintain comparability with these ESMs, we employed the grid size‐dependent settings of this ORCA1 configuration, as detailed in Table

These include a prescribed field of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) at the ocean bottom at a few choke points (e.g., the Indonesian throughflow) and an asymmetrical latitudinal profile for the ad hoc parameterization of the penetration of TKE below the mixed layer (based on Gaspar et al.,
