<p class="p">The only intentional change made to the physical setup of ORCA1, relative to ORCA025, is the use of a slightly lower albedo for snow on sea ice. As explained in detail in section 
 <xref rid="jame20790-sec-0008" ref-type="sec" class="xref">3.3</xref>, we introduced this change to compensate for too weak sea ice bottom melt in the Arctic, itself arising from deficient advection of warm Atlantic water through Fram Strait. In the development process we varied a number of NEMO parameters with the aim to decrease the sea surface temperature (SST) cold bias in the northwest Atlantic discussed below. These tests had little impact on the cold SST bias; a brief overview of them and their outcome is given in Appendix A.
