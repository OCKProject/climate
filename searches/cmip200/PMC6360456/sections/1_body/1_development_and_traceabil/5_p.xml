<p class="p">In the GO6 configurations it was found that in small inlets at the coast of Antarctica that have a size of only one grid point excessive sea ice can build up over time. This is a combined effect of meltwater input and lack of advection in single‚Äêgrid point areas, specifically on the grid employed by CICE (a different type of grid than NEMO). While the stability of the model is unaffected by this, we decided to smooth the coastline of Antarctica, closing these inlets, to avoid this effect altogether.</p>
