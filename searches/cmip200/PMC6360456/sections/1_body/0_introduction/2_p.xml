<p class="p">Comprehensive and detailed models of the global climate system, called atmosphere‐ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs), are essential tools to understand the climate system. Such an understanding strives to explain past, present, and future climate processes and their changes. This is especially relevant in the context of ongoing man‐made global change (IPCC,

The same models will also be used to make projections of the future climate over the coming century, providing a vital service to policy‐makers and society at large.
