<p class="p">In this article we give a first description of the physical low‐resolution configuration N96ORCA1, comprising atmosphere, ocean, sea ice, and land surface models. Within this special issue of 
 <italic class="italic">JAMES</italic> on HadGEM3 GC3 and UKESM1, there are, or will be, a number of companion papers exploring in greater depth many of the aspects that we mention here. For instance, Williams et al. (
 <xref rid="jame20790-bib-0075" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>) describe the medium‐resolution atmosphere, ocean, sea ice, and land surface model configuration. A forthcoming paper will describe the performance of UKESM1, which is based on N96ORCA1 and represents interactively the global carbon cycle, including dynamic vegetation and a model for stratosphere‐troposphere chemistry. Further papers in preparation will evaluate the performance of the preindustrial (PI) control simulations, the historical simulations for CMIP6, radiative forcing and climate sensitivity, etc.
