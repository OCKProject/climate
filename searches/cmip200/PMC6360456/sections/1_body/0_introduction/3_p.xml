<p class="p">The physical climate model HadGEM3 (Hadley Centre Global Environment Model 3) has been developed by the Met Office Hadley Centre in the United Kingdom since the late 2000s. It was always intended that it could be configured at different spatial resolutions and with varying degrees of complexity (e.g., number of physical and biogeophysical processes included) depending on the research questions (Hewitt et al., 
 <xref rid="jame20790-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). Here we report on a new configuration, developed at a relatively coarse horizontal resolution, N96ORCA1, for use as the physical core of the UK Earth System Model (UKESM1). Because of the added process complexity in an Earth system model (ESM), and the need to advect many additional tracers, the previously existing medium‐resolution version of HadGEM3, N216ORCA025 (Williams et al., 
 <xref rid="jame20790-bib-0075" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>) would have been computationally too expensive for this purpose. The horizontal resolutions are 135 km in the atmosphere and 1° in the ocean for N96ORCA1 and 60 km/0.25° for N216ORCA025.
