<p class="p">Changing the spatial resolution of a model can affect the scientific performance. For instance, Lauer et al. (
 <xref rid="jame20790-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>) showed an improvement in—mostly intraday—rainfall variability over tropical regions with increasing resolution of the EC‐Earth atmosphere model (up to, but not beyond, ~0.4°). For diagnostics related to mean precipitation, Demory et al. (
 <xref rid="jame20790-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) found an improvement over the same range of resolutions in an earlier version of HadGEM3. At the same time, as we show in this paper (for the Southern Ocean), an increase in resolution does not necessarily lead to improved model performance.
