<p class="p">In the process of developing and evaluating the coarse‐resolution version, N96ORCA1, in relation to the preexisting resolutions, N216ORCA025 and N96ORCA025, 
 <italic class="italic">traceability</italic> was of paramount importance. By traceability we mean that ideally the scientific settings and adjustments of HadGEM3 are not dependent on the chosen spatial resolution. Excepted are parameterizations of processes that are resolved at higher resolution, for example, mesoscale ocean eddies that need to be fully parameterized at 1° resolution but less so at 0.25° resolution. For any resolution‐specific settings that are necessary, we have documented their motivation and their consequences carefully in the present paper. At the same time, we aimed at reproducing the observed, present‐day (PD) climate as closely as possible.
