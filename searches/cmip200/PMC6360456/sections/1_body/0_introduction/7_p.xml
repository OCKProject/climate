<p class="p">Model biases (affecting mean values or variability) can have an effect on the future climate response, as assessed by evaluation of historical simulations against observations (e.g., Massonnet et al., 
 <xref rid="jame20790-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Sometimes a relationship between model biases and future feedback responses, common across an ensemble of models, can be exploited to constrain the future response of a given process (e.g., Wenzel et al., 
 <xref rid="jame20790-bib-0073" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). However, it is not a given that a reliable model performance during the observational record equates to a realistic future projection response (Knutti et al., 
 <xref rid="jame20790-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). In addition, there are a number of long‐standing biases, common to many climate models, that may predicate an unrealistic future response compared to what would be seen if the bias were corrected through physically reasonable improvements. These include sea ice biases and impacts on the future sea ice albedo feedback (Qu &amp; Hall, 
 <xref rid="jame20790-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>), biases in surface‐atmosphere interaction and the magnitude of future soil moisture feedbacks (Hohenegger et al., 
 <xref rid="jame20790-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>), and systematic PD cloud biases influencing future cloud feedbacks (Trenberth &amp; Fasullo, 
 <xref rid="jame20790-bib-0069" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). By analyzing such biases (and the impact of different spatial resolutions) we hope to lead the way to their further understanding and reduction.
