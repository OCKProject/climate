<p class="p">There is a marked decrease in summer season aerosol forcing over the early 21st century as aerosols ramp down sharply, the response to which is especially large during the summer season when solar insolation is high and especially pronounced in midlatitudes where aerosol production takes place. This positive trend in radiative forcing in midlatitudes during the first half of the 21st century is of similar magnitude to the positive greenhouse forcing trend (~1 W/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) and yields prominent warming in the midlatitudes relative to subpolar latitudes, i.e., an Arctic de-amplification. Over the latter half of the 21st century, as the aerosol trend is minimal, greenhouse forcing dominates, and the trend returns toward AA. This effect is seen as an inflection in the AA index in the mid-21st century (

We can also see this effect in the spatial pattern of first-half 21st century surface temperature trends, which displays especially prominent warming over the midlatitude continents in the ensemble mean and especially in the subset of models that are most negative QRA trending (
