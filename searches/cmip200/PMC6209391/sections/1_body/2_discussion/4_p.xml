<p class="p">These trends reflect a competition between the overall influence of greenhouse warming on QRA, which, as we have seen before (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>), is a steady increase in QRA, and the mitigating effects of decreasing aerosol forcing, which dominates in the first half of the 21st century and is most prominent in the AIE-only simulations. The models that exhibit the greatest decline in the QRA fingerprint series during the first half of the 21st century are the models that display especially pronounced midlatitude warming during that period (
