<p class="p">We are now in a position to understand the behavior observed in the QRA fingerprint series (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>). For the full multimodel ensemble mean, we see a slowdown in the increasing trend over the first half of the 21st century, followed by an acceleration in the late 21st century. In the case of the AIE subset, we see a flat (actually, very slightly negative) trend over the first half of the 21st century, followed by a very rapid increase over the latter 21st century. A slim majority (59%) of the multimodel simulations exhibit an increase in the QRA fingerprint during the first half of the 21st century, while there is an equal split (50%) between increasing and decreasing QRA among the AIE simulations.
