<p class="p">In both cases, however, by the end of the 21st century, the impact of greenhouse warming is dominant, and we observe an increase in 64% of the full multimodel ensemble simulations and 74% of the AIE-only simulations (the number is higher in this case because many of the models must recover from a prominent aerosol-induced decrease during the first half of the century). In terms of the actual number of QRA events, we project an average increase from the current historical level of ~7.5 events/year to ~11 events/year, i.e., a roughly 50% increase in the annual number of events, for the full multimodel ensemble. In some individual models, however, the increase is far greater (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>). These models tend (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Fig. 4C</xref>) to be those where greenhouse-induced high-latitude amplification dominates. It is apparent that the treatment of anthropogenic aerosols plays a key role in determining the pathway of QRA changes over the next century.
