<p class="p">In contrast with the 1PCTCO2 simulations, the RCP 8.5 projections (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>) show no clear pattern of polar amplification of summer warming. This effect is particularly pronounced in the AIE simulations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>, A and B). Only 46% of the multimodel simulations (less than half) and an even lower 32% (less than a third) of the AIE simulations exhibit positive polar amplification. This underappreciated feature of the climate projections is readily understood as a consequence of projected changes in anthropogenic aerosol forcing.
