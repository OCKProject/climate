 <italic class="italic">N</italic> = 35 realizations, 
 <italic class="italic">M</italic> = 26 models; table S2). Each physics version of a model was considered a separate model. The simulations are all initialized using a preindustrial control simulation and are of varying length. The analysis was limited to the maximum length (140-year) time interval common to all but one simulation in the archive. We used a simple area-weighted average to create zonal means at a 5Â° interval.
