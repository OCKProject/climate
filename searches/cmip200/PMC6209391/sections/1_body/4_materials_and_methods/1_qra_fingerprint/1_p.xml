 <italic class="italic">z</italic> = 1000 hPa daily data over the full Northern Hemisphere (0°N to 90°N) in 37 steps (2.5°). We focused on long-duration (≥10 days) wave number 7 events to define QRA-favorable time intervals and confined zonal mean profiles to the latitude range (25°N to 75°N) of interest. The fingerprint was interpolated to a 5° latitude to be consistent with the grid of the model simulations and observational datasets (see below) and centered on zero. This yields an 11-element zero-centered row vector that defines the QRA fingerprint.
