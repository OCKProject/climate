<p class="p">The QRA fingerprint is found to be robust with respect to sampling considerations. Calculating the fingerprint based on either the first half (1979–1997) or second half (1998–2015) of the full ERA dataset yields profiles that are very similar to those based on the full (1979–2015) data interval (fig. S4).</p>
