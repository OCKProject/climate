<p class="p">We also calculated the time series of observed annual QRA events using the set of all QRA events, with wave numbers 6 to 8 detected in the ERA reanalysis dataset over 1979â€“2015 (

 <italic class="italic">f</italic> = 0.2 cycle/year cutoff) for the purpose of comparison with other calculated QRA series. We used mean and variance matching with this series to scale the observational and model-based QRA fingerprint series in dimensions of equivalent annual number of QRA events.
