<p class="p">We used the CMIP5 RCP 8.5 (
 <italic class="italic">N</italic> = 73 realizations, 
 <italic class="italic">M</italic> = 39 models; table S3) multimodel simulations for the analyses in the main article. Each physics version of a model was considered a separate model. The analysis was limited to the common time period of overlap for all models and realizations (2006–2099). We used a simple area-weighted average to create zonal means at a 5° interval. We did separate analyses using only the subset of (AIE) simulations that include both first and second indirect effects (
 <italic class="italic">N</italic> = 28 realizations, 
 <italic class="italic">M</italic> = 15 models). We did additional analyses (see the Supplementary Materials) using the CMIP5 RCP 2.6 simulations (
 <italic class="italic">N</italic> = 58 realizations, 
 <italic class="italic">M</italic> = 29 models; table S4) and the subset of AIE simulations (
 <italic class="italic">N</italic> = 25 realizations, 
 <italic class="italic">M</italic> = 11 models).
