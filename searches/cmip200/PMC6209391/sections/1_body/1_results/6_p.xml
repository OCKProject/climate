<p class="p">We then examined the CMIP5 future (2006–2100) projections (see Materials and methods for details). We focus on the RCP (Representative Concentration Pathway) 8.5 experiments (
 <italic class="italic">N</italic> = 73 simulations, 
 <italic class="italic">M</italic> = 39 models; see table S3), which reflect a “business-as-usual” scenario of steadily increasing carbon emissions through the end of the 21st century, but with a sharp drop-off in anthropogenic sulfate aerosol production over the next half century (reflecting the assumption of a transition to “cleaner” coal burning in the developing world). Results for the RCP 2.6 scenario (table S4), which reflects more ambitious carbon emission reductions, yield qualitatively similar results but with substantially smaller future projected changes (see figs. S2 and S3).
