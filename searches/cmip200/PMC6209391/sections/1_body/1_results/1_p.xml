<p class="p">Here, we extend the M17 analysis by examining the behavior of the QRA fingerprint in future climate projections (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>). The fingerprint (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1A</xref>) exhibits negative values in the subtropics, increases to near-neutral values at 40°N, a decline toward more negative values through 50°N, and pronounced positive values again at higher subpolar latitudes. The JJA meridional temperature profiles associated with several prominent recent QRA-influenced extreme weather events (2003 European heat wave, 2010 Russian wildfires/Pakistan floods, and 2011 Oklahoma/Texas heat wave and drought) are also shown (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1A</xref>) along with the large-scale 300-hPa meridional wind fields, zonal wave number spectra, and zonal mean zonal wind profiles associated with the three events, each of which exhibits the expected QRA features (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1B</xref>; note, for example, the spectral peaks in the 
 <italic class="italic">k</italic> = 6/7/8 range and the double-peaked latitudinal structure in the zonal winds).
