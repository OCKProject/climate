<p class="p">We see how each of the three events is associated with a prominent wave 6/7/8 pattern, and a summer mean meridional temperature profile that projects substantially onto the QRA fingerprint. The correlations with the fingerprint are 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.79, 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.63, and 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.41, respectively, which are statistically significant at the 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.001, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.02, and 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.1 levels, respectively. Superimposed on the seasonal mean temperature profiles is considerable intraseasonal variation, and the positive projection of the seasonal mean temperature profiles onto the QRA fingerprint substantially increases the likelihood of daily-to-weekly temperature profiles that closely resemble the QRA fingerprint.
