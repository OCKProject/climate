<p class="p">Examining the multimodel ensemble mean JJA surface temperatures, we see the expected polar amplification of warming with latitude (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Fig. 2A</xref>), with summer (JJA) warming in the high-latitude zone (65°N to 75°N) substantially exceeding that for the midlatitude zone (25°N to 60°N) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Fig. 2B</xref>). The multimodel mean AA index (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Fig. 2C</xref>) shows a nearly linear increase over time. There is spread within the multimodel ensemble [with two-thirds (67%) of the ensemble members displaying AA]. We next examine the QRA fingerprint series [
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Fig. 2D</xref>; the unitless QRA index has been scaled against the actual historical series of annual QRA event numbers (see Materials and methods) for the purpose of defining the vertical scale]. This series displays an even more robust positive trend [in this case, more than three-fourths (76%) of the ensemble members display a positive trend], consistent with the hypothesis (see M17) that climate change attributes other than AA—particularly the enhanced land/ocean contrast and perhaps changing snow cover (

 <italic class="italic">U</italic> field (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Fig. 2E</xref>) onto the QRA series shows the expected (M17) anomaly pattern of weakened midlatitude westerlies and strengthened subpolar and subtropical westerlies indicative of the double-peaked jet associated with QRA-favorable conditions. The observed ~2 m/s peak-to-peak amplitude of the response is consistent with a simple calculation based on the thermal wind approximation (see Materials and methods).
