<p class="p">Arctic-amplified warming projects onto this latitudinal anomaly pattern. However, the fingerprint has considerably more latitudinal structure than a simple index (65N to 75N mean minus 25N to 60N mean temperatures) of AA (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1A</xref>). Thus, while we might expect some broad similarity in the behavior of the QRA fingerprint and AA index, we might also expect some significant differences. The anomalous meridional temperature gradient associated with the QRA profile is characterized by a large positive peak in the midlatitude zone of 50°N to 65°N, which, via thermal wind, implies a more-pronounced minimum in the zonal mean zonal wind. More poleward (i.e., beyond 65°N), the reduction in the temperature gradient (and thus a stronger negative gradient) implies stronger westerlies in subpolar regions. As noted earlier, these are precisely the double-peaked jet conditions associated with QRA.
