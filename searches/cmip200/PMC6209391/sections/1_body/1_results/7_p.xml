<p class="p">We combine the projections and the previously assessed (M17) CMIP5 historical (1880â€“2005) simulations (
 <italic class="italic">N</italic> = 164, 
 <italic class="italic">M</italic> = 48; see table S1) to provide a historical context for the future projections. We analyze both the full multimodel ensembles and the aerosol indirect effects (AIE) subsets of the ensembles consisting only of models that include both aerosol first and second indirect effects (
 <italic class="italic">N</italic> = 46 historical simulations and 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic> = 28 future simulations) to better assess the potentially important role played by anthropogenic aerosols.
