 </xref>), M17 produced a composite of boreal summer [June to August (JJA)] zonally averaged near-surface (1000 hPa) temperature profiles associated with QRA-favorable time intervals. Differencing the QRA-favorable and climatological mean profiles, they defined an anomalous meridional temperature “fingerprint” associated with QRA conditions, onto which polar-amplified warming projects positively (although there is additional structure in the fingerprint related to, e.g., land/ocean contrast). Examining the trend over time in this fingerprint in both long-term historical observations and the CMIP5 historical model simulations (table S1), they found consistent evidence for an increase in QRA-favorable conditions.
