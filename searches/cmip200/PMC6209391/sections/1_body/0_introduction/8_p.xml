<p class="p">As the derivation of the fundamental equations requires a certain degree of idealization, there are some caveats with this conceptual development. As QRA-related disturbances grow sufficiently in amplitude, they become baroclinically unstable and the barotropic assumption (and WKB approximation) is violated. Our zonal mean approach neglects longitudinal variations in the zonal flow and the possibility of meridionally oriented waveguides. Nonetheless, the theoretical framework presented above is useful for understanding the conditions under which QRA is likely to arise. The reader is referred to the studies of Petoukhov
