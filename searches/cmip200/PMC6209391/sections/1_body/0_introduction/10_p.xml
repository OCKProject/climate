 </xref>) argued that an increase in QRA events during the satellite reanalysis era (1979–2011) coincides with a measure of Arctic amplification (AA) of warming. This amplification is expected from various feedbacks including the ice-albedo feedback associated with anthropogenic greenhouse warming. While both the polar and subtropical boundaries of the waveguide are important, it is the former that is strongly affected by this amplified warming. Because upper-level westerlies are tied to a negative meridional gradient (i.e., colder toward the pole) in lower tropospheric temperatures through the thermal wind relationship, AA of warming would seem to imply reduced upper-level midlatitude westerlies (
