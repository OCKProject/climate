 </xref>), there is a robust relationship between surface/lower atmosphere temperature gradients and upper-level zonal winds in the regions critical to QRA, and there is a clear signature for the various key QRA events noted of the past few decades. These profiles are governed substantially by large-scale radiative forcing and are likely to yield a robust metric when applied to climate model simulations, yet are closely tied to QRA through the thermal wind mechanism as discussed above.
