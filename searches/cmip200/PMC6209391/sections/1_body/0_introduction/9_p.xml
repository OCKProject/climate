 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. (

 </xref>) showed that QRA explains roughly a third of all high-amplitude events with wave numbers 6 to 8 and that amplitudes of quasi-stationary waves of that wave number range are significantly higher when resonance conditions are met. They also showed that planetary waves amplified by QRA exhibit specific preferred phases due to the characteristic stationary orographic forcing of the Northern Hemisphere midlatitudinal orographic profile. Their analysis shows that central United States and western Europe are specifically susceptible for persistent heat waves during QRA episodes (
