<p class="p">If the waveguide is (almost) circumglobal, then wave energy is efficiently trapped and waves constructively interfere with the forcing, leading to resonance. Trapped planetary waves with 
 <italic class="italic">k</italic> = 6 to 8 that are excited by thermal or orographic forcing will tend to grow in amplitude. The waveguide condition depends only on the zonal wave number 
 <italic class="italic">k</italic> and the shape of the zonal mean zonal wind (
 <italic class="italic">ū</italic>) profile. Through the thermal wind relationship, this profile can, in turn, be tied to meridional temperature gradients in the lower troposphere. Although a zonal mean approach neglects regional variations in the zonal flow, it has shown to be suitable for assessing the “waveguidability” of jets (
