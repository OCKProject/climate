<p class="p">To test whether this indirect approach to assessing QRA in models is more reliable than a direct analysis of QRA events in the model simulations, we have performed an analysis across the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) multimodel historical ensemble used in this study (see Materials and methods) to examine the relative faithfulness with which the two respective quantities, i.e., 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>(ϕ) and 
 <italic class="italic">d</italic>
 <sup class="sup">
  <italic class="italic">2</italic>
 </sup>
 <italic class="italic">u</italic>(ϕ)/
 <italic class="italic">d</italic>ϕ
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>, are reproduced in the climate models relative to (reanalysis) observations. We observe a small ensemble mean error of roughly 0.5% for 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>(ϕ) [or, alternatively, a still modest roughly 27% ensemble mean error for 
 <italic class="italic">dT</italic>(ϕ)/
 <italic class="italic">d</italic>ϕ]. For comparison, we obtain a quite large 344% error for 
 <italic class="italic">d</italic>
 <sup class="sup">
  <italic class="italic">2</italic>
 </sup>
 <italic class="italic">u</italic>(ϕ)/
 <italic class="italic">d</italic>ϕ
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> (see fig. S1). We conclude that our indirect approach, wherein the 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>(ϕ) profile is used as a proxy for QRA behavior in the models, can yield meaningful results, while direct assessment of QRA behavior is not possible using currently available multimodel ensemble simulations. One assumption of our approach, of course, is that the fingerprint as established in historical observations remains valid in the future. Related to that assumption is the assumption that the structure of planetary waves excited by orographic or thermal forcing remains similar in the future.
