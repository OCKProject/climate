<p id="Par34" class="p">Several studies have found that biases in blocking are intimately connected to biases in the mean flow, such that a region with low blocking will typically exhibit a mean westerly wind bias [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118" class="xref">118</xref>]. While seemingly a classic chicken-and-egg problem, analysis indicates that low blocking frequencies alone cannot explain the mean bias, but in converse the mean state bias can, in good models at least, often statistically ‘explain’ the blocking bias [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117" class="xref">117</xref>]. This highlights the sensitivity of many blocking indices to the mean state, so that some diagnosed changes in blocking, either in model biases or responses to forcing, may simply reflect a mean shift of the climate rather than any change in the variability of the flow [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119" class="xref">119</xref>]. However, in some cases, it is clear that biases in blocking are intimately related to structural errors in the representation of jet variability [
