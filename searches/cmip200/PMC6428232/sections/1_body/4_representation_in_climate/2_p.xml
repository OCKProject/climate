<p id="Par26" class="p">Anecdotal evidence suggests that blocking frequencies can still be fragile even in relatively capable models, with the gains accomplished in one model version sometimes lost in the following version. Apparent blocking improvements in a model can also occur through compensation of errors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109" class="xref">109</xref>]. A further problem is that the sporadic nature of the event leads to strong natural variability in blocking frequencies, which can often hamper model evaluation when short periods prone to sampling uncertainty are used for test simulations. Despite these problems, experience has shown that modelled blocking can (sometimes, but certainly not always) be improved by:
