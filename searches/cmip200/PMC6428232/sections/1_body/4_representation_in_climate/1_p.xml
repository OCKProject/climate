 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> shows the mean biases from CMIP5 models using the three different blocking indices. This shows a general agreement between methods on an underestimate of Atlantic/European blocking of around 30–50% of the observed frequency in winter and around 10–30% in summer (particularly in the high-latitude Eurasian region). In contrast, biases in the Pacific sector are smaller and often not significant. This highlights the role of different processes acting in Pacific versus European blocks, and it is possible for one to be improved in a model while the other degrades [
