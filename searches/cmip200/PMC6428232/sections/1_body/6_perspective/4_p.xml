<p id="Par43" class="p">One of the less recognised challenges associated with blocking is its strong natural variability, including, for example, a small number of rare but very persistent and high-impact events. There are several practical consequences of this, for example that long time periods or multiple ensemble members are often needed to obtain good sampling statistics of blocking in data. Given the level of natural variability, it is perhaps not surprising that no fully consistent long-term trends in blocking have yet emerged in observations. Given the importance of natural variability for mid-latitude circulation in general [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR148" class="xref">148</xref>], it is likely that this will continue to play a leading role in blocking variations over the coming few decades. Coupled with the relatively gradual future decline of blocking in the ensemble projections, this suggests that blocking is likely to remain a major source of extreme weather during this century. This is especially true in summer given the association with heatwaves. The impact of wintertime blocking on temperature is largely due to thermal advection which is likely to weaken in the future, but in contrast the temperature impacts of summertime blocking may strengthen due to soil moisture feedbacks.
