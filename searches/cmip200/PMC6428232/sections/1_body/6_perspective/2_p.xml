<p id="Par41" class="p">Even when different methods agree, however, confidence is still relatively low in projected blocking changes. One reason for this is the lack of theoretical support, with several different physical mechanisms contributing to blocking, which thus far has prevented the development of a theory for the whole life cycle of the event. Another reason is the continued underestimation of blocking activity by climate models, particularly for the Atlantic/European sector in winter. The reliance of blocking on many aspects of numerical model design means that only a handful of models can be considered to have a reasonable simulation of blocking. This leads to a dilemma over whether to include all models in blocking studies or only a subset of the best models. There is no clear solution to this since, for example, it may turn out that the critical ingredient for future blocking change might not be a modelâ€™s present-day skill in blocking but its skill in predicting the response in some remote driver, such as the pattern of SST change.</p>
