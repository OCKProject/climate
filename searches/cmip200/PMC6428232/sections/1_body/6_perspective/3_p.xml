<p id="Par42" class="p">Considering the century-timescale projections, there remains a general agreement between models on an overall decline in mid-latitude blocking occurrence, at least in the hemispherical mean. Important regional, seasonal and methodological differences are emerging, however, which are yet to be fully understood. Regarding the caveats above, it is important to note that the projected changes are generally smaller in magnitude than the model biases and the decadal variability in blocking frequency. It is not clear how important this is, but obviously a model with very little blocking is severely limited in how it can respond to forcing. In many cases, the projected changes in blocking appear to be relatively ‘passive’ consequences of changes in the atmospheric mean state. It remains possible that improved representation of the many dynamical processes involved may lead to blocking responding in a more ‘active’ way to anthropogenic forcing. More targeted, process-based studies with capable models may help to improve confidence in model projections.</p>
