<p id="Par12" class="p">An essential aspect of a block is that the dynamics are able to maintain it in the same position relative to an observer on the ground, even though there may be strong westerly flow upstream and downstream. In the simplest case of an extended ridge embedded in a large-amplitude Rossby wave train (e.g. Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>a), this can be understood as a balance between advection by the background zonal flow and westward propagation by the Rossby wave pattern. However, when the large-amplitude disturbance is confined to a limited zonal sector, more complex explanations are required [
