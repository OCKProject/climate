 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">41</xref>]. Poleward moving air within the warm sector of an intensifying cyclone experiences strong dynamical forcing of ascent and is called the ‘warm conveyor belt’ (WCB). Latent heat release amplifies the large-scale ascent and also tends to amplify cyclone growth rate. Heating enables the WCB air to cross θ-surfaces so that the outflow is at a higher level, enabling transport from the boundary layer to tropopause level in ridges. Madonna et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">42</xref>] showed that the average θ-increase in WCBs is 20–25 K. Following trajectories within a WCB, the PV increases below the heating maximum but then decreases again above the heating, such that the average PV of the outflow is expected to be approximately equal to the PV of the inflow [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">43</xref>]. Therefore, the chief influence of the latent heating, relative to dry dynamics, is to create a greater anticyclonic anomaly because the outflow is at a higher level (where the background PV is higher) rather than because the air mass PV value has decreased. A greater proportion of WCB air also turns anti-cyclonically into the ridge, rather than wrapping cyclonically about the cyclone [
