<p id="Par10" class="p">A key characteristic of block onset is a rapid poleward displacement of subtropical air, setting up a large-scale extended ridge, within a Rossby wave pattern on the mid-latitude jet stream. Since both potential temperature (θ) and potential vorticity (PV) are approximately conserved following air parcels, we can identify the air within the extended ridge with a low PV anomaly on a surface of constant θ, or as a high θ anomaly on the dynamic tropopause (a surface of constant PV) as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>. The ridge extension typically occurs rapidly, on the timescale of 1–3 days. There is often a wide range of scales at play in blocking onset, involving both planetary-scale waves, which tend to be close to an equivalent barotropic structure in the vertical, and baroclinic waves central to synoptic-scale weather systems. Regarding the former, blocking-like flow configurations can arise from purely planetary-scale dynamics in severely simplified systems (e.g. [
