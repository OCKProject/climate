<p id="Par16" class="p">The slow decay of blocks has often been linked to radiative decay of anomalies, but the vertical structure of long-wave cooling might actually act to enhance upper tropospheric anticyclonic anomalies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">47</xref>]. Block decay is more likely associated with a breakdown of the maintenance process or disruption through advection by other systems, so that the low PV anomaly can be reabsorbed into the subtropical low PV pool [
