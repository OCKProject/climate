 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">46</xref>] quantified the relative contributions of adiabatic and diabatic transport pathways into the low PV anomaly of blocks. Back trajectories showed that 30–45% of the air parcels in the low PV anomaly of blocks experience heating (&gt; 2 K) over the last 3 days, implying that latent heat release is of high importance for ridge building and block maintenance. It is not clear whether cyclones with stronger diabatic heating are more likely to cause block onset through enhanced diabatic mass transport into the ridge, or whether the positive feedback of heating on cyclone growth rate and meridional extension is a greater effect.
