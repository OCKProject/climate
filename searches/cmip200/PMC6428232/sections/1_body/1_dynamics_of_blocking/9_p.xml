<p id="Par17" class="p">Several studies have recently addressed lead-lag connections between winter blocking and polar stratospheric variability. Regional blocking influences the polar vortex strength by modulating the upward propagation of tropospheric planetary waves into the stratosphere. This influence depends on the geographical location of the block, which can lead to warming of the polar stratosphere through mainly constructive interference with the climatological planetary waves (e.g. [
