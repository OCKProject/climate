<p id="Par39" class="p">Major efforts are required to better understand the uncertainty in future blocking projections. To this aim, several studies have explored different approaches. One of them entails the selection of the best performing models in historical simulations based on the assumption that model biases may degrade future projections. However, these models do not always agree on their projections [

A more reasonable tactic invokes improved process understanding. A process-oriented approach has been particularly implemented in the modelling exercises that isolate the blocking responses to different aspects of the global warming pattern. This suggests that upper-level tropical warming is a key factor driving the reduction in blocking due to its effect of strengthening the zonal winds [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR147" class="xref">147</xref>] but others suggesting a negligible, or even negative change in blocking occurrence [
