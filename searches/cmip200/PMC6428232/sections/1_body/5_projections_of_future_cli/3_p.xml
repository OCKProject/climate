<p id="Par38" class="p">The generally decreased blocking frequency in future climate could result in a reduction in weather and climate extremes. However, changes in the background state or local feedbacks could counteract this reduction, for example increases in surface sensible heat flux associated with enhanced soil moisture drying [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79" class="xref">79</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR137" class="xref">137</xref>]. There are several examples supporting changing relationships between blocking and its impacts. For instance, the cooling effect of Atlantic winter blocking over Europe is projected to weaken [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" class="xref">63</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138" class="xref">138</xref>] due to a reduced land-sea temperature contrast and thermal advection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR139" class="xref">139</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR140" class="xref">140</xref>]. However, temperature anomalies associated with European winter blocking could shift northeastward, along with changes in blocking location [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121" class="xref">121</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR141" class="xref">141</xref>], likely leading to stronger impacts in regions that are less affected in the present climate. Similarly, Okhotsk winter blocking may trigger a higher frequency of cold days over Japan [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129" class="xref">129</xref>] and Ural winter blocking may exert a stronger impact on East Asia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR132" class="xref">132</xref>], as already observed in recent decades [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR142" class="xref">142</xref>]. The relationship between temperature and blocking will continue to play an important role in the development of cold spells and heatwaves in all seasons [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" class="xref">67</xref>]. However, it is crucial to use large ensembles of different climate models, as single realisations do not necessarily capture this relationship [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122" class="xref">122</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR143" class="xref">143</xref>]. The links between blocking and stratospheric variability also seem to remain under climate change scenarios. However, the region of blocking influence on planetary wave propagation may show an eastward shift in the Euro-Atlantic sector, resulting in a more effective influence of blocking on the polar stratosphere [
