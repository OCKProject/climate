<p id="Par36" class="p">Earlier climate model projections such as CMIP3 consistently featured a general reduction in blocking frequency [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85" class="xref">85</xref>] as the mid-latitude jets strengthened and/or shifted poleward in many regions. The more recent CMIP5 model projections have suggested that the responses of blocking frequency to climate change might be weaker and more complex [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87" class="xref">87</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128" class="xref">128</xref>]. The Euro-Atlantic and Pacific winter blocking frequencies are projected to decrease on their western flanks but increase on the eastern flanks, suggesting an eastward shift in blocking activity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87" class="xref">87</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129" class="xref">129</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR131" class="xref">131</xref>]. During summer, poleward shifts in blocking activity are reported, leading to decreases in blocking frequency in mid-latitudes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR131" class="xref">131</xref>] but increases in high latitudes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87" class="xref">87</xref>]. The Urals are among the few regions where blocking may increase in a future climate, although this is not robust across models, studies and even scenarios [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128" class="xref">128</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR131" class="xref">131</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133" class="xref">133</xref>]. The quantitative results, however, are somewhat sensitive to the blocking detection methods, as illustrated using the three methods in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>. In the multi-model ensemble, the largest decreases are detected during winter in the absolute method, but during summer in the anomaly method, with similar changes in the hybrid index. The spatial distribution of the projected changes also differs, suggesting that different methods reveal different aspects of blocking changes and/or are not equally sensitive to changes in the mean vs changes in variability. In the Southern Hemisphere, blocking frequency is also anticipated to decrease, particularly in the Pacific during austral spring and summer, with a hint of meridional displacements. As in its northern counterpart, seasonal changes are more diverse, with regional but not robust increases across the models [
