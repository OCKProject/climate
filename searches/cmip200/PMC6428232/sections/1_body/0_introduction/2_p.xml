 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> to provide an indication of the range of circulation patterns that have been referred to as blocking. The simplest, but also perhaps the most contentious in terms of blocking definition, is a stationary ridge in a large-amplitude Rossby wave. In these, low potential vorticity (PV), air is advected from the subtropics and is therefore anomalously anticyclonic relative to its surroundings [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>], with stationarity being achieved if the Rossby wave has a near zero phase speed. The ‘omega block’ is similar but the poleward diversion is even larger in amplitude with some closed contours in geostrophic stream function (termed a meridional block by [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>]). The other configurations shown involve Rossby wave breaking, where the extended ridge is folded over in either a cyclonic or anticyclonic sense [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>]. In the wave-breaking events, typically the meridional PV gradient is reversed, and the PV anomalies can form a ‘dipole block’ with the anticyclonic PV anomaly on the poleward side of the cyclonic anomaly. This situation is often described as the ‘Rex Block’ following Rex [
