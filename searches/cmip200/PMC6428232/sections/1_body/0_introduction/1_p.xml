<p id="Par4" class="p">The term ‘blocking’ refers to a class of weather systems in the middle to high latitudes. While many meteorologists would agree on whether a particular feature constitutes a cyclone, for example, there is regular disagreement over what should actually be considered a block. Common characteristics are persistence, quasi-stationarity and obstruction of the usual westerly flow and/or storm tracks. Blocks often, but not always, exhibit a large anticyclonic anomaly and reverse the zonal flow such that net easterly winds are seen in some part of the blocked region. By disrupting the usual westerly flow for an extended period such as a week or even longer, these events are often associated with regional extreme weather, from heatwaves in summer to severe cold in winter.</p>
