<p id="Par6" class="p">This range in blocking patterns is accompanied by a variety of impacts and dynamical mechanisms. As a result, a large number of blocking indices have been proposed in the literature, as different groups present their own particular interpretations and definitions of blocking. This wide range of methods can be confusing to researchers in different fields, but it at least partly reflects the diversity in blocking systems themselves. Given this diversity, most confidence can be placed on results which are supported by several different methods. For example, many studies using different methods have identified blocking as a sporadic and hence highly variable phenomenon, with large fluctuations from seasonal to decadal time scales [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>], while some can arise purely from local mid-latitude dynamics (e.g. [
