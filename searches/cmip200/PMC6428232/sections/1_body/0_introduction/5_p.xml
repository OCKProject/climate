<p id="Par8" class="p">This short review does not attempt to provide a complete overview of all aspects of blocking, but is instead focused on the projected changes in blocking occurrence and characteristics under climate change scenarios and the factors which directly relate to these. While most of the literature concerns Northern Hemisphere blocking, many of the concepts reviewed relate equally well to Southern Hemisphere blocking. We begin with a very brief introduction to the dynamics involved in blocking life cycles and the associated impacts. We then give an overview of the methods used to identify blocking in gridded datasets. From there we turn to the climate models, firstly to assess their skill in representing blocking and secondly to summarise the projected changes for blocking and what we know about the underlying physics.</p>
