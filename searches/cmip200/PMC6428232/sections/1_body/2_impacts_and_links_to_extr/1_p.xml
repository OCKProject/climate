<p id="Par18" class="p">In the regions where blocking typically occurs, the prevailing oceanic westerly flow and associated winds provide warmth in winter and chill in summer. When these winds are obstructed during blocking, the result is therefore a seasonal extreme: cold in winter and hot in summer. Reduced cloud cover in the anticyclonic regions also gives a similar effect, with net surface warming in summer and cooling in winter. These relationships differ in importance seasonally, with thermal advection associated with easterly or northerly winds dominating in winter, but radiative effects being more important in summer [

Blocking events in spring and autumn generally attract less interest as they do not lead to the warmest or coldest days annually, but they can still have strong impacts, for example on the agricultural sector in the all-important growing season [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" class="xref">67</xref>]. Blocking also has strong hydrological impacts, most obviously with dry conditions in the anticyclonic region contributing to droughts. In contrast, regions adjacent to the block can experience extreme rainfall due to the persistent deflection of synoptic storms along the same path [

The clear sky and air stagnation conditions underneath European blocking highs enhance the concentrations of particulate matter during winter and the photochemical build-up of surface ozone during spring and summer, eventually exceeding the air quality targets of these pollutants over some regions of Europe [
