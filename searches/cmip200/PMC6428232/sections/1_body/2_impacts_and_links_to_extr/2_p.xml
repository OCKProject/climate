<p id="Par19" class="p">The strongest impacts of blocking occur due to its persistence, which can allow temperature and moisture anomalies to build up over one or more weeks. Blocking has hence been a key contributing factor to several notable extreme events, for example the European heatwave of 1976 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" class="xref">72</xref>], the extreme heatwave in the southern and southeastern USA in 1980 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73" class="xref">73</xref>], the Russian heatwave of 2010 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74" class="xref">74</xref>] and the cold European winter of 2010 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75" class="xref">75</xref>]. Such events are often extremely persistent to the extent that they stand out as clear outliers from the distribution of event durations. In some of these cases at least, there is evidence of remote driving which supports the block, for example through a forced Rossby wave train from the tropics [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">39</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76" class="xref">76</xref>]. Local feedbacks from anomalies in soil moisture can clearly amplify the surface heat during summer blocks [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77" class="xref">77</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79" class="xref">79</xref>]. It is not clear to what extent this feeds back to influence the blocking circulation pattern itself, although some studies report potential effects [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80" class="xref">80</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81" class="xref">81</xref>]. Extreme temperatures in mega-heatwaves have contributions from the combined multi-day memory of the land surface and the atmospheric boundary layer as well as heat advection from neighbouring regions, so that a realistic representation of land–atmosphere interactions in climate models is crucial for simulating extreme heatwaves [
