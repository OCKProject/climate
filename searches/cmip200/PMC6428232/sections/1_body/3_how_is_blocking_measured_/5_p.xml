<p id="Par24" class="p">The different blocking methods have their own strengths and weaknesses and hence we consider all indices equally valid. This diversity should be viewed as an opportunity rather than a limitation, since each approach provides different but complementary aspects of the same phenomenon. In this sense, the exploitation of an array of blocking indices is perhaps wiser than the search for a definitive blocking definition. One may argue that an optimal blocking definition should be founded on the underlying dynamics. Unfortunately, a full dynamical understanding of blocking is still an open issue (see Section ‘
 <xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Dynamics of Blocking</xref>’) and several dynamical processes may be at play in the development of blocking. Instead, we suggest the following recommendations for future blocking methodologies. Firstly, a blocking definition should be inclusive, identifying but differentiating between all types of blocks (i.e. with different structures, in different regions and seasons). In this sense, there remains the challenge of distinguishing among high-low dipoles, omega blocks and even open ridges (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Secondly, the use of thresholds should be kept at a minimum and derived from the input data to accommodate seasonal and long-term variations and allow the applicability of the method to different climate states.
