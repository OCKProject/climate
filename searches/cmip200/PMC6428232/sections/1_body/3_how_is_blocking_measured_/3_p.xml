 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> shows winter and summer mean blocking frequency from three different blocking indices spanning the aforementioned approaches, and three different reanalyses. Briefly, these methods all use Z500 and are based on anomalies (ANO), absolute field reversal (ABS) or a combination of the two (MIX); see the Appendix for more details. Climatological features are reasonably robust across reanalyses, and all indices display more frequent blocking in winter than in summer, with a preference for oceanic blocking in winter and continental blocking in summer. However, there are differences in the reported frequency and preferred locations.
