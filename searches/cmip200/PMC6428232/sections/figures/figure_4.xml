  <p class="p">Blocking projections. Multi-model mean (MMM) RCP8.5 projections of (top) winter and (bottom) summer blocking frequency changes (shading, in percentage of days in the season) for the 2061–2090 period with respect to the 1961–1990 period of the historical simulation: (left) anomaly method (ANO), (middle) absolute method (ABS), (right) hybrid method (MIX). Contour lines depict the MMM historical (1961–1990) blocking frequency climatology (2% intervals starting at 2%). Changes are only displayed over regions with historical blocking frequencies above 1% in the MMM. Black dots denote regions of model disagreement on the sign of changes (i.e. less than two thirds of the models displaying the same sign). CMIP5 models (one member per model): BNU-ESM, BCC-CSM1-1, BCC-CSM1-1-M, CanESM2, CCSM4, CMCC-CESM, CMCC-CM, CMCC-CMS, CNRM-CM5, FGOALS-g2, FGOALS-s2, GFDL-CM3, GFDL-ESM2M, HadGEM2-CC, HadGEM2-ES*, IPSL-CM5A-LR, IPSL-CM5A-MR, IPSL-CM5B-LR, MIROC5, MIROC-ESM, MIROC-ESM-CHEM, MPI-ESM-LR, MPI-ESM-MR, MRI-CGCM3, NorESM1-M. *The 1981–2005 period is used instead as historical period</p>
