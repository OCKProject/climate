<p class="p">On the other hand, the ALL forcing simulations of T
 <sub class="sub">14°C</sub> show considerable observation-model improvement compared to T
 <sub class="sub">220m</sub> in all basins (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3e–h</xref>). Overall, the root-mean-square (RMS) values associated with the observed T
 <sub class="sub">14°C</sub> time series are lower than those for T
 <sub class="sub">220m</sub> except for the Pacific Ocean, and RMS values associated with the MMEM T
 <sub class="sub">14°C</sub> time series are about half of those for T
 <sub class="sub">220m</sub> (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Table S2</xref>). The abrupt volcanic induced cooling events are again evident in observations and both the ALL and NAT simulations, but the long-term warming is more steady for the entire period compared to that from T
 <sub class="sub">220m</sub>. Similar to the larger qualitative agreement with observations for long-term trends in T
 <sub class="sub">14°C</sub> compared to T
 <sub class="sub">220m</sub>, the RMS differences of the time series of T
 <sub class="sub">14°C</sub> are also reduced between observations and the MMEM compared to T
 <sub class="sub">220m</sub>, by 29–57% for individual basins (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Table S3</xref>). This reduction is slightly higher than previously reported using an ensemble from a single model (reduction of 15–40%)
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11" class="xref">11</xref>. The largest reduction of the RMS differences occurs in the Indian Ocean, where the observations are dominated by strong sub-thermocline cooling which occurs closer to the surface than in the models
