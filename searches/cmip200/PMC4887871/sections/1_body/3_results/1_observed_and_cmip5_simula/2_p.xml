<p class="p">Equivalent maps calculated from the ALL forcing CMIP5 multi-model ensemble mean (MMEM) are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1d–f</xref>. For T
 <sub class="sub">220m</sub>, the MMEM exhibit no decreasing trends as seen in the observations, and the increasing trends are generally stronger, except for the North Atlantic (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1a,d</xref>). However, regions that display weak increasing trends do in fact coincide with the regions of decreasing trends in the observations, for example, along the equator in the Pacific and the eastern Indian Ocean. For T
 <sub class="sub">14°C</sub>, the MMEM is in good agreement with observations, and in some regions weak decreasing trends are simulated, consistent with the observed map (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1b,e</xref>). This is evident over the far eastern equatorial regions of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, and appears to be related to a deepening of the isotherm (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1c,f</xref>). We note that some differences between the observations and the MMEM appear to arise from large-scale modes of intrinsic internal variability, of which the MMEM does not capture. For example, in the Pacific, the observed temperature trend patterns somewhat resemble the pattern often associated with the Pacific Interdecadal Oscillation
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" class="xref">21</xref>. Using the isotherm approach appears to remove some of this large-scale noise from the observations (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1a,b</xref>) resulting in the better agreement with the MMEM, yet it cannot be assumed that the influence of such internal climate variability via all processes (i.e. all upper-to-deeper vertical transport

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" class="xref">23</xref> and horizontal re-distribution
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" class="xref">24</xref> of heat) can be removed completely. Therefore, a caveat in the detection and attribution of external forcings in upper-ocean temperature trends will be that variability of this kind is a potential source of observation-model inconsistency. This will be discussed further in following sections. Comparison of trends in the 14 °C isotherm depth between observations and the MMEM also indicates spatial consistency, except for an eastward displacement of the large increase in the North Atlantic and a weak deepening in the tropical Indian Ocean in the MMEM (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1c,f</xref>). These small differences are related to similar spatial biases in the MMEM mean state compared to the observations (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Fig. S1a,c</xref>). It is found that the MMEM simulates a global-mean depth of the 14 °C isotherm depth that is slightly deeper than observations, yet with a comparable global-mean T
 <sub class="sub">14°C</sub> trend (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2a</xref>). Examining individual models, a small number exhibit a large difference compared to the observed depth of the 14 °C isotherm, of up to approximately 100 m, which could be related to a mean state bias or the model resolution. Further, a significant inter-model relationship exists between the time-spatial mean depth of the 14 °C isotherm and the trend in T
 <sub class="sub">14°C</sub> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2a</xref>). This is as one might expect because the warming signal is surface-intensified in the oceans
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2" class="xref">2</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6" class="xref">6</xref>, so those models with a shallower 14 °C isotherm tend to show a larger rate of warming, with mean temperature and isotherm changes making separable and additive contributions to such changes in T
