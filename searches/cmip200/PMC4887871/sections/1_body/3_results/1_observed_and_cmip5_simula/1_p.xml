 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Figure 1a,b</xref> compare the spatial maps of trends in T
 <sub class="sub">220m</sub> and T
 <sub class="sub">14°C</sub>, respectively, over the period 1951–2010 from HadEN4 observations
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17" class="xref">17</xref>. We show only results from spatially complete infilled estimates from HadEN4, but note they are very similar to sub-sampled spatial patterns
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11" class="xref">11</xref>, but spatially less variable. In addition, we consider only results for HadEN4 because generally the ensemble spread amongst observational products is small compared with the anthropogenic signal
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" class="xref">18</xref>, and HadEN4 estimates are improved relative to previous versions
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17" class="xref">17</xref>. Averaged over the upper 220 m, the largest widespread increase in temperature has occurred in the North Atlantic, at a rate about twice that of other basins, of which has been documented in previous studies

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20" class="xref">20</xref> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1a</xref>). The largest regions with decreasing trends in T
 <sub class="sub">220m</sub> occur along the equator and in the north of the Pacific and Indian Oceans. In contrast, for temperatures averaged above the 14 °C isotherm, the warming in the North Atlantic is not as striking, and there is cooling along the equator in the Atlantic (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1b</xref>). Similarly, decreasing temperature trends in the Pacific are not as marked for T
 <sub class="sub">14°C</sub> as they are for T
 <sub class="sub">220m</sub>, and are almost absent in the Indian Ocean. The cooling in the equatorial Pacific is much more confined in T
 <sub class="sub">14°C,</sub> with large warming either side of the equator. Decreasing trends in upper-ocean temperatures from both analyses tend to be associated with a shoaling of the 14 °C isotherm, whereas the large temperature increase in the North Atlantic is associated with a strong deepening (
