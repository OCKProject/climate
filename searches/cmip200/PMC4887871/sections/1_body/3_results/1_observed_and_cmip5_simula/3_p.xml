 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11" class="xref">11</xref>, the T
 <sub class="sub">14°C</sub> trends from observations, and the CMIP5 MMEM, have more spatial uniformity, but also a reduced variance in model ensemble trend spread, compared to T

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Fig. S2</xref>). This results from removing some of the ocean circulation influences on T
 <sub class="sub">14°C</sub> that are associated with intrinsic internal variability, and plays a large role in fixed depth temperature trends
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11" class="xref">11</xref>. This is further supported by the fact that the spatial differences between T
 <sub class="sub">220m</sub> and T
 <sub class="sub">14°C</sub> trends for both observations and the MMEM are similar to the overall spatial pattern of trends in the depth of the 14 °C isotherm (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Figure 2b</xref> highlights the statistically significant inter-model relationship that exists between the global-mean differences between T
 <sub class="sub">220m</sub> and T
 <sub class="sub">14°C</sub> and trends in the depth of the 14 °C isotherm. The MMEM has a larger difference between the two temperature trends (T
 <sub class="sub">220m</sub> minus T
 <sub class="sub">14°C</sub>) despite a similar global-mean depth trend compared to the observations. More so, models with a larger depth trend in the 14 °C isotherm show a larger discrepancy between T
 <sub class="sub">220m</sub> and T
 <sub class="sub">14°C</sub> trends. This is due to both changes in temperature above the 14 °C isotherm and the depth of the 14 °C isotherm contributing to the temperature changes in the upper 220 m ocean layer
