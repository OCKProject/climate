<p class="p">Time series of the annual global-mean T
 <sub class="sub">220m</sub> anomalies show that the ALL forcing MMEM simulates much stronger warming compared to the observations from the early 1990’s (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3a</xref>). This may be attributable to (i) less cooling response and a quicker recovery associated with the large 1991 volcanic eruption and a lack of simulating a series of recent small tropical volcanic eruptions
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" class="xref">25</xref>; (ii) intrinsic internal multidecadal climate variability

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26" class="xref">26</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27" class="xref">27</xref>; or (iii) the fact that historical data are very sparse in many ocean regions especially in the early period
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9" class="xref">9</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28" class="xref">28</xref>, hence the long-term warming trend might be underestimated in the observations. The main regional contributions to the excessive warming in the global-mean T
 <sub class="sub">220m</sub> arises from stronger warming in the Pacific and Indian Oceans in the MMEM, which are considerably less sampled compared to the Atlantic (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3b–d</xref>). In the NAT simulations, responses due to the major volcanic eruptions (i.e. 1963, 1982 and 1991) are clearly evident and have a significant contribution to the ALL simulations variability (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3a–d</xref>). In addition the NAT forcing induces a short positive contribution during the 1950s, yet there is no significant long-term trend to explain the large warming in the observations.
