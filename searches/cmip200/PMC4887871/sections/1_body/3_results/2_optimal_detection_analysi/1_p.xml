 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29" class="xref">29</xref>. In this method, observations are regressed via generalized linear regression onto the two multi-model simulated signals of ANT and NAT simultaneously (see Methods for details), in order to estimate the contribution by both anthropogenic and natural external forcings to changes in upper-ocean temperatures. Using a large set of unforced control simulations, we obtain an estimate of the internal climate variability, in addition to conducting a residual consistency test
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29" class="xref">29</xref> to compare model-simulated internal variability with observations. Resulting best estimates and uncertainty ranges (5–95% confidence intervals) of the scaling factors, which scale estimates of the responses to individual combinations of forcings to best reproduce observed changes, are used to determine whether external forcing fingerprints can be identified in the observations. The influence of external forcing is detected when a scaling factor is significantly greater than zero, and considered consistent with observations when its uncertainty ranges include unity.
