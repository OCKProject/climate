<p class="p">We first conduct the fingerprint analysis using 2-year averaged global-mean and individual ocean basin T
 <sub class="sub">220m</sub> and T
 <sub class="sub">14°C</sub> time series over the period 1951–2010 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4a</xref>). Scaling factors are shown which consider full empirical orthogonal function (EOF) dimensions (i.e. a truncation value 30 from a 2-year averaged 60-year time series). Using the 2-year temporal resolution removes some high frequency noise that we are not concerned with, yet still allows the quantification of larger influences from natural external forcing such as volcanic activities. Consistent with the qualitative analysis of the spatial and time series results, we find that the models overestimate the response to ANT for T
 <sub class="sub">220m</sub> in all basins, but in the Pacific the 90% confidence interval includes unity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4a</xref>). Interestingly, the model fingerprints also indicate an overestimation of the response to NAT or no detection. However, we note that the residual consistency test fails in all T
 <sub class="sub">220m</sub> cases except the Atlantic, indicating that the residual variability that remains in the observations after removing the scaled response is inconsistent with model internal variability. Therefore, it is only in the Atlantic that both ANT and NAT forcing signals are robustly detected for T
 <sub class="sub">220m</sub>, owing to the larger warming signal over variability noise. For T
 <sub class="sub">14°C</sub>, the ANT response is robustly detected, and the best estimates lie close to unity, in all basins except the Indian Ocean (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4a</xref>). This indicates the models simulate well the long-term evolution of the observed T
 <sub class="sub">14°C</sub> during 1951–2010. The residual consistency test is not passed for T
 <sub class="sub">14°C</sub> in the Indian Ocean, which may be a result from both the mean bias of the 14 °C isotherm in the models, and the depth at which the excessive cooling is simulated in the models during the last fifty years
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8" class="xref">8</xref>. A clear detection of a NAT signal for T
 <sub class="sub">14°C</sub> is also shown for the global-mean and Atlantic analyses. The confidence interval associated with the global-mean includes unity, suggesting that the models upper-ocean heat content response to solar and volcanic changes is consistent with the observations.
