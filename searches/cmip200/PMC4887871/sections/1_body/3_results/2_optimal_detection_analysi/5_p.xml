<p class="p">Another sensitivity test we consider is the effect of temporal resolution to the fingerprint identification. Many studies report that the NAT signal is unable to be detected above intrinsic internal variability in upper-ocean temperatures

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6" class="xref">6</xref>. However these studies considered longer time averaging scales to remove the majority of internal variability (i.e. 5 or 10-year temporal resolutions). However, such temporal resolutions also potentially remove the upper-oceans response to natural external forcings such as volcanic cooling events. This appears to be true, as by using the same CMIP5 MMEM and observations over the period 1951–2010 but applying a 5-year averaging, the NAT signal in T

Hence, this result provides evidence for the need to consider a similar temporal resolution (i.e. 2-year rather than 5 or 10-year) to the radiative effect of volcanic eruptions, which is generally short-lived in the upper-ocean, about 1–3 years
