<p class="p">Next we apply a five-point spatial model fingerprint analysis to the CMIP5 multi-model ensemble previously conducted using a single-model ensemble
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11" class="xref">11</xref>. For example, we concatenate, by ocean basins which are also separated by hemisphere, the 2-year averaged temperature anomaly in the North Atlantic, South Atlantic, North Pacific, South Pacific and Indian Oceans, and repeat the two-signal fingerprint analysis over the period 1951–2010 (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Fig. S3</xref>). The results are also compared to with those from a CMIP3
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30" class="xref">30</xref> multi-model ensemble to assess the robustness of the method used to estimate individual forcing contributions (see Methods for details). 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Figure 4b</xref> shows the resulting best estimate scaling factors and confidence intervals for the two generations of models, for an EOF truncation of 30 as in the individual basin analysis. Interestingly, both ANT and NAT fingerprints are detected in CMIP5 for T
 <sub class="sub">220m</sub> and T
 <sub class="sub">14°C</sub>. However, we note that it is only for T
 <sub class="sub">14°C</sub> that the detection results are robust, because the residual variability remaining in the observations for T
 <sub class="sub">220m</sub>, after removing the scaled response, is inconsistent with model internal variability (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Fig. S4</xref>). For CMIP3, only ANT and NAT fingerprints are robustly detected for T
 <sub class="sub">14°C</sub>, with a best estimate scaling factor very close to CMIP5. For T
 <sub class="sub">220m</sub> there is no detectable signal from NAT forcing for CMIP3, consistent with previous studies
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11" class="xref">11</xref>. The difference between CMIP5 and CMIP3 could be due to more sophisticated aerosol schemes in the CMIP5 models which are better able to capture the external climatic forcing.
