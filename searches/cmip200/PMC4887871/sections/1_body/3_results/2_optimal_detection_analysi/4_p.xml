<p class="p">Overall, results from the five-point spatial model fingerprint confirms the ANT best estimate response in both T
 <sub class="sub">220m</sub> and T
 <sub class="sub">14°C</sub> is slightly overestimated in the models. Yet confidence intervals include unity for T
 <sub class="sub">14°C</sub>, and the ANT signal also needs to be scaled down more for T
 <sub class="sub">220m</sub>. Using a fixed depth of 260 m (the MMEM depth of the 14 °C isotherm (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11" class="xref">11</xref> over a slightly shorter period (i.e. 1950–1999), as we detect external signals for T
 <sub class="sub">220m</sub> in the CMIP5 and CMIP3 multi-model ensembles. Here substantially increasing the number of noise samples in our analysis may aid in improving the signal-to-noise ratio over a longer period compared to a single-model analysis. Repeating the analysis over the shorter period 1951–2000, the same as in previous analyses
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11" class="xref">11</xref>, we indeed obtain consistent results with such single-model ensemble analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4c</xref>). For example, neither ANT nor NAT fingerprints are robustly detected for T
 <sub class="sub">220m</sub> considering the joint confidence intervals (ellipses), yet we note the ANT signal by itself is, although overestimated, robustly detected (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4c</xref>).
