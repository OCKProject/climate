<p class="p">Runs with and without particular radiative forcings were taken for eight CMIP5 models, and seven CMIP3 models. The experiments for CMIP5 examined include only natural forcings that include the effects of solar irradiance and volcanos (NAT), and experiments for CMIP3 examined include only anthropogenic forcings that include effects of greenhouse gases, sulphate aerosol, and ozone changes (ANT). We estimated the anthropogenic forced (ANT) signal for CMIP5 as the difference between ALL forcing and NAT forcing under the assumption of linearly additive responses to the external forcings. We estimated the NAT signal for CMIP3 as the difference between ALL forcing and ANT forcing under the assumption of linearly additive responses to the external forcings. Assuming that the effects of different forcings can cumulate linearly is commonly used when assessing individual forcing runs from climate models

Overall, trends calculated using only the three CMIP5 models where all individual runs were available (i.e. bcc-cms1-1, CanESM2 and NorESM1-M;
