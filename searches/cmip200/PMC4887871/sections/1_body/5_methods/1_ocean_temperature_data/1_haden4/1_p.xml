 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36" class="xref">36</xref> to account for observational sampling techniques in past decades. It was previously noted that T
 <sub class="sub">14°C</sub> measurements are insensitive to these correction
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9" class="xref">9</xref>. We also find that using HadEN4 with another set of bias corrections
