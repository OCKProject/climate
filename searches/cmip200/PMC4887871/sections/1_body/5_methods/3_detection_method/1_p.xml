<p class="p">To compare observed and modeled T
 <sub class="sub">220m</sub> and T
 <sub class="sub">14°C</sub> anomaly time series, an optimal fingerprinting technique
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29" class="xref">29</xref> was employed. Observations (
 <bold class="bold">y</bold>) were regressed onto multi-model mean response patterns (
 <bold class="bold">X</bold>, fingerprints of ANT, and NAT here) such that 
 <bold class="bold">y</bold> = (
 <bold class="bold">X − ν)β</bold> + 
 <bold class="bold">ε</bold>. Here regression coefficients 
 <bold class="bold">β</bold> (or scaling factors) are obtained by the total least squares method, 
 <bold class="bold">ν</bold> represents the component of 
 <bold class="bold">X</bold> due to internal variability that remains after multi-model averaging, and 
 <bold class="bold">ε</bold> represents residual variability that is generated internally in the climate system. The variance-covariance matrix of 
 <bold class="bold">ε</bold> is estimated from pre-industrial control simulations, and that of 
 <bold class="bold">ν</bold> is taken to be proportional to the variance-covariance matrix of 
 <bold class="bold">ε</bold>, where the constant of proportionality reflects the methods used to calculate the multi-model ensemble response patterns. Two-signal analyses are undertaken whereby observations were regressed onto ANT and NAT simultaneously. This allows an examination of whether ANT and NAT are jointly detected and whether the influence of ANT is separable from that of NAT and internal variability in the observations. We divided 60-yr blocks of control simulations into two sets (150 blocks each) for the optimal fingerprinting analysis. The first set was used to obtain best estimates of 
 <bold class="bold">β</bold> and the other set is used to estimate the 5–95% uncertainty range for 
 <bold class="bold">β</bold> and also to carry out a standard residual consistency test
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29" class="xref">29</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40" class="xref">40</xref>. This test offers a convenient method to check whether model-simulated internal variance is consistent with observational residual variance. Since the key aspect of this study was on long-term variability of upper-ocean changes plus short-lived variability due to volcanic aerosols, we calculated 2-year mean time series of anomalies to remove high frequency noise such as interannual variability. Therefore, 30-dimensional data vectors of observations and model simulations are obtained (from 60-year time series). Since data vectors have low dimension compared to the number of blocks of control simulations available for covariance matrix estimation (30 dimensions versus 150 blocks for each of the two covariance matrix estimates), we did not apply further dimension reduction such as empirical orthogonal function (EOF) truncations
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40" class="xref">40</xref>, except for the five-point spatial model fingerprint analysis, for which we apply an EOF truncation of 30.
