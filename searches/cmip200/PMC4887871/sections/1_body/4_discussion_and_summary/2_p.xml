<p class="p">Another factor of the observations not considered here, are contributions by decadal changes in modes of intrinsic internal variability. This may have partly contributed to the overestimation of the MMEM, as a slowdown in recent warming has been observed since the late 1990s

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1a–d</xref>), similar small contributions due to the Pacific Interdecadal Oscillation are removed from both T
 <sub class="sub">220m</sub> and T
 <sub class="sub">14°C</sub> time series (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Fig. S5</xref>). This question needs to be further investigated in future work through comprehensive assessments of both observed and modelled multidecadal variability modes and their connections to the upper ocean temperature variations. In contrast, a recent study on extreme temperature detection found better agreement between observed and modeled trends after removing internal climate variability influences on the observations
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34" class="xref">34</xref>. However, in that case models underestimate the observed warming, resulting in improvement, yet here the model overestimation may simply suggest a systematic bias of the models, perhaps too sensitive, in the responses of upper ocean temperature to external forcing, causes of which remain uncertain.
