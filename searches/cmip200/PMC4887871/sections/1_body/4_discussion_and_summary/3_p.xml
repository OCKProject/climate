<p class="p">Using an average temperature above a fixed isotherm as opposed to a fixed depth yields trends in better agreement with the observations. Therefore, some overestimation of the upper-ocean warming may also arise from a stronger influence on upper-ocean temperatures from ocean dynamical changes in the models. One possibility to examine this is by adopting an alternative approach to ocean heat content changes, whereby it is estimated relative to a fixed isotherm

Such a method allows the quantification of the separate contributions to heat content changes from the deepening of the reference isotherm, indicative of changes in ocean dynamics and circulation, versus warming above the isotherm, indicative of changes in surface air-sea heat fluxes. This method has previously been used to assess the individual contributions to observed changes in upper-ocean heat content

Applying this method to a large, multi-model ensemble as used in the present study, would improve our understanding and allow quantification of the individual contributions to upper-ocean temperature changes, and help to address the concern of large uncertainty in the upper ocean heat content estimates
