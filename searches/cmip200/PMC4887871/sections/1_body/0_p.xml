<p class="p">The degree to which ocean temperatures have warmed in recent decades varies considerably with depth and ocean basins, but overall the upper-ocean (i.e. ~200â€‰m) has warmed at a much higher rate

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8" class="xref">8</xref>. For the upper-ocean, differences in regional warming rates can arise in part due to changes in two key drivers, surface forcing such as air-sea heat fluxes, and ocean advection of the near-surface waters
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9" class="xref">9</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10" class="xref">10</xref>. There is a need to consider upper-ocean warming in the sense of separating surface heat fluxes and ocean advection responses. This is because the atmosphere and land have very minor heat capacity on multi-annual timescales, therefore the ocean must be the recipient of net radiative budget changes via air-sea heat exchange from increasing anthropogenic greenhouse gases and changes in natural external climatic forcings such as volcanic activities

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" class="xref">12</xref>. Anthropogenic emissions of aerosols have recently also been shown to be important for fluctuations in past regional upper ocean temperatures
