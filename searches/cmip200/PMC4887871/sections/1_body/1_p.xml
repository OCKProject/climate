<p class="p">A number of studies find natural external climatic forcing signals (i.e. solar and volcanic activities) indistinguishable from intrinsic natural internal ocean variability
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2" class="xref">2</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4" class="xref">4</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6" class="xref">6</xref>. However, these findings often only consider external influences over longer periods, for example pentad or decadal averaging timescales, of which major volcanic aerosol forcings do not completely persist in the upper-ocean
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14" class="xref">14</xref>. Indeed, it has been shown in a single model study that using a higher temporal resolution (i.e. 2-year timescale) and a more suitable upper-ocean temperature estimate, the influence of such natural external forcings can be detected
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11" class="xref">11</xref>. That is, by quantifying upper-ocean temperature changes relative to a fixed isotherm, rather than the more commonly adopted method of a fixed depth

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5" class="xref">5</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7" class="xref">7</xref>, noise associated with intrinsic internal variability in the oceans is dramatically reduced for both observations and models, allowing the contribution from surface heat fluxes alone, to be better isolated
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9" class="xref">9</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11" class="xref">11</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" class="xref">15</xref>. However these conclusions are based on analysis of only a single model
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11" class="xref">11</xref>. Therefore this issue would benefit from further analysis including an extended observation length, updated observational data sets including recent work on bias corrections, but more importantly strengthened by taking advantage of the large state-of-the-art multi-model ensemble from the latest generation of climate models.
