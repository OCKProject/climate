<p class="p">In the context of attributing contributions from different external forcings to upper-ocean temperature changes, we use a suite of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5)
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16" class="xref">16</xref> models (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Table S1</xref>) forced with all historical radiative forcings (ALL) as well as individual forcing runs of natural external influences (solar and volcanic activities, denoted NAT) (see Methods for details). We calculate the overall anthropogenic forcing (greenhouse gas, sulphate aerosol, and ozone changes, denoted ANT) as the difference between ALL and NAT. We use these simulations to (i) compare upper-ocean temperature changes estimated relative to a fixed isotherm (average temperature above the 14 °C isotherm, denoted T
 <sub class="sub">14°C</sub>) versus a fixed depth (average temperature in the upper 220 m, denoted T
 <sub class="sub">220m</sub>); and (ii) examine whether the upper-ocean temperature trends from the two methods can be attributed to external anthropogenic and/or natural external climatic forcings. The 14 °C isotherm and fixed depth of 220 m are used to calculate the two upper-ocean temperature estimates to allow direct comparison with previous studies

The 14 °C isotherm is suggested to provide good spatial coverage of the upper-ocean, at low to mid-latitudes, throughout the observational record, and 220 m because it is the overall time-spatial mean depth of the 14 °C isotherm in low and mid-latitudes
