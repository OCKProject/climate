<p id="Par41" class="p">The ABCD model prepared for each watershed was calibrated to the monthly streamflow measured at the outlets from 2008 to 2012. The calibration period was selected considering the availability of runoff observations to be used in parameter calibration. A sampling-based optimization algorithm, SCE-UA

 </sup>. To take subjectivity into account in the parameter uncertainty estimation, the combinations of an absolute threshold of the minimum NSE of 0.67 and the four different relative thresholds of the best 10%, 7.5%, 5%, and 2.5% were applied in identifying behavioral parameter sets out of those sampled in the calibration. It is worth noting that this study initially included 156 candidate watersheds for which USGS streamflow gage data are available within the Ohio River basin, and watersheds where the ABCD models did not meet the absolute performance criterion (NSE of at least 0.67) were excluded from this study. In Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S7</xref>, a parameter set that provided the highest NSE value was selected for each watershed.
