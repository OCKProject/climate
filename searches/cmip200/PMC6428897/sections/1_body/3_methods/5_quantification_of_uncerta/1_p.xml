<p id="Par42" class="p">The difference between maximum and minimum values (ranges) of projected climate variables (precipitation and temperature) and hydrological components (QQ, DR, SS, etc.) was calculated as a measure of the amount of uncertainty contained in ensemble predictions made using multiple GCMs and multiple (behavioral) parameter sets. Uncertainty in the multi-parameter ensembles was first quantified by calculating the ranges (the differences between upper and lower limits) of the monthly hydrographs simulated using the behavioral parameter sets that had been previously identified for each combination of GCMs and study watersheds (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig" class="xref">12</xref>). Then, an average hydrograph of multi-parameter ensembles was derived for each GCM and study watershed combination, and the range of the variations in the average hydrographs across the GCMs for each watershed was regarded as the amount of uncertainty in the multi-GCM ensembles (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig" class="xref">12</xref>). Thus, the uncertainty amount quantified for two different sources, multiple hydrological models (or parameter sets) and multiple GCM ensembles, is independent of each other, which allows a direct comparison of the two uncertainty quantities. The range is a statistical measure that has been commonly used to quantify uncertainty in hydrological modeling

 </sup>. The range could show the maximum amount of uncertainty we could have from selecting GCMs and hydrologic model parameters in this study. Furthermore, the range could provide more straightforward and explicit quantification of uncertainty, compared to other statistical measures such as interquartile range and variance, as it is a direct measure of the spread of data.
