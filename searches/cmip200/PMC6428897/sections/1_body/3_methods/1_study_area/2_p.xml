<p id="Par36" class="p">It has been predicted that the annual streamflow of agricultural watersheds located in the Midwestern U.S. could decrease by as much as 40% depending on GCMs under the Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES)

 </sup>. A study found that the crop productivity of the Ohio River basin could decrease by 20% under climate projections; it also showed that there was a large amount of uncertainty in sediment and nutrient loads projected by seven CMIP5 GCMs
