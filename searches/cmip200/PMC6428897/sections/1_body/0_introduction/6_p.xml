<p id="Par7" class="p">There are only a few known studies about the influence of equifinality of hydrological models on climate change impact assessment. A study argued that uncertainty originating from hydrological models is as large as that of climate models

On the other hands, other studies demonstrated that hydrological model parameter uncertainty is the least influential; notably, though, the numbers of parameter sets incorporated into their studies were small (10 to 20), indicating there was a strong possibility that the impacts of equifinality might be underestimated
