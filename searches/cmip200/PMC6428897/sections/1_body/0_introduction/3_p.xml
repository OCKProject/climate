<p id="Par4" class="p">Because of the global nature of the climate system and the complexity of the underlying climate physics, climate change impact assessments are often implemented in continental and regional extents, which, however, are not the scales at which most hydrological analyses and water resources management are carried out

For instance, hillslope processes including infiltration and overland flow transport are more dominant and influential in the hydrology and ecosystem of a small watershed, while channel routing and groundwater flow are processes controlling the overall hydrological response of a large watershed
