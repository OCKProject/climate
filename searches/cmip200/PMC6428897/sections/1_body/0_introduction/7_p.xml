<p id="Par8" class="p">This study compared the significance of selections of GCMs and hydrological model parameters (equifinality) on hydrological assessment of climate change for local headwater watersheds. For this comparison to be meaningful, we quantified uncertainty in multi-GCM and multi-parameter ensemble projections made for the weather and hydrology of multiple watersheds. In addition, 35 ensemble members including 22 CMIP5 GCMs and their variants (hereafter 35 GCMs) were considered in this study, and 61 headwater watersheds found in the Ohio River basin were incorporated to show variability in quantified uncertainty across different watersheds and climate. A monthly water balance model, ABCD, was employed as a mathematical representation of the mechanisms that control the responses of the hydrological components to climate variability. The behavioral parameter sets of the water balance model that were developed for each watershed were identified using the Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimator (GLUE) framework

 </sup>, and multiple acceptability thresholds were applied to see the sensitivity of quantified equifinality impacts on the overall uncertainty to the subjective threshold selections. This study also showed how uncertainty in temperature and precipitation projections influence hydrological variables including direct runoff, soil water content, evapotranspiration and groundwater at the local watershed scale.
