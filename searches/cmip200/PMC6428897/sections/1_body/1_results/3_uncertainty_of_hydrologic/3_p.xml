<p id="Par18" class="p">The PET projection showed a more considerable uncertainty compared to those of QQ, DR, or GW, particularly in summer. The PET projections also showed great spatial variations across the latitudes between 36° 07′N and 42° 26′N within the Ohio River basin; alternatively, the uncertainty of the actual ET projections was larger in winter than in summer, but the seasonal variations were small. Low SS could limit ET in summer, which regulated the variations of the uncertainty in the ET projections. Moreover, compared with summer, the ET projection variations were more substantial during winter when SS was relatively high. Uncertainty in the SS projection did not largely vary by the seasons due to the water-holding capacity of the soil layers. Since WA mainly consisted of SS, the amounts and seasonal trends of the uncertainty amounts of each were similar.</p>
