<p id="Par17" class="p">Uncertainty in the projections of the multi-GCM and multi-parameter ensembles of hydrological components was first quantified in the depth unit of mm by the study watersheds; then, it was normalized by dividing their depths by the precipitation depths for the purpose of a fair comparison of uncertainty across the watersheds (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). It is worth clarifying that the average values represent the overall uncertainty in the Ohio River watersheds and the height of each box represents the watershed wise variations of the uncertainty in the boxplots (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>).The overall average uncertainty in the monthly multi-parameter ensemble streamflow (QQ) projections for the 61 study watersheds varied from 9.2% (8.63 mm) to 13.4% (11.93 mm) of monthly precipitation depths under RCP 4.5 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). Variations of the streamflow projection uncertainty across the watersheds were relatively large in winter; no significant difference was found in the amount of uncertainty between the QQ projections under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios. The amount of uncertainty in the QQ projections was smaller than those of the DR projections, but they were larger than those in the GW projections, indicating that DR is more sensitive to parameter uncertainty than GW.
