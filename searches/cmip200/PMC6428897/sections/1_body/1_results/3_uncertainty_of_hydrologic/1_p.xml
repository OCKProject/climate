<p id="Par16" class="p">The behavioral parameter values of the ABCD models developed for the 61 study watersheds were aggregated by the parameters to develop the overall parameter posterior distributions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S6</xref>). The mode of the posterior distribution of parameter 
 <italic class="italic">a</italic> that is related to the infiltration capacity was the highest in the narrowest value range, and that of parameter 
 <italic class="italic">d</italic> for the control of groundwater flow showed the lowest mode with the widest value range. Considering the hydrological meanings of

 </sup>, such findings indicate the infiltration excess mechanism is dominant in the watersheds, and the proportions of groundwater to streamflow are relatively variable and uncertain across the study watersheds. The posterior distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">b</italic> had a symmetric bell shape with a mode in the range from 200 to 500, meaning that the maximum monthly storage capacity of the watersheds is 350 mm on average. The parameter 
 <italic class="italic">c</italic> values were distributed around 0.1, ranging from 0.0 to 0.6, indicating that the groundwater contribution to streamflow is approximately 10%, but that it is also highly variable across the watersheds. The posterior distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">e</italic>, introduced to adjust the ET values, was relatively symmetric around 1.0 with a tail on the right side.
