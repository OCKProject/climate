<p id="Par10" class="p">The annual temperature was projected to increase by 2.2 °C and 3.6 °C on average in the watersheds under the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios, respectively, compared to the historical average temperature of 12 °C (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>), which is also consistent with the previous study

 </sup>. The monthly maximum and minimum temperatures were predicted to increase in most of the watersheds. The variations of the minimum temperature across the study watersheds (variations in the minimum temperature projections by the watersheds or the heights of the boxes in the boxplots, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>) were more significant than those of the maximum temperature. The amount of variation in the maximum temperature across the watersheds was relatively consistent over months, but the minimum temperature widely varied by the watersheds during winter, indicating that the climate change of the Ohio River watersheds would be more evident in terms of the minimum (rather than maximum) temperature. The projected increases of the minimum temperature were mapped to identify spatial trends in the projections (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>). In the maps prepared for November, December, and January, the differences between the historical and projected temperatures increased across the basin from the southwest (mild temperate or humid subtropical) to the northeast (humid continental). The spatial variability was higher in January than November and December, and it was greater in the RCP 8.5 scenario than the RCP 4.5. According to the Köppen-Geiger climate classification system
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" class="xref">59</xref>
 </sup>, the Ohio River basin lies on four climate zones, Cfa, Cfb, Dfa, and Dfb, where “C” signifies “Temperate”, “f” represents “Without Dry Season”, “a” means “Hot Summer”, “b” means “Warm Summer”, and “D” signifies “Cold” (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>). The comparison between the spatial patterns of projected temperature increases and the climate classification map suggested that the winter hydrology of areas that have relatively cold weather (e.g. Dfb in the northeast) can be more substantially influenced by projected temperature changes, compared to temperate areas (e.g. Cfa in the southwest).
