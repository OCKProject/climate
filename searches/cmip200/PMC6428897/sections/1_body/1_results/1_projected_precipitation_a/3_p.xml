<p id="Par11" class="p">The monthly ensemble precipitation and temperature projection made by using the 35 GCMs for the entire 61 watersheds, as well as the “03232500” watershed that was selected as an example because of its representability in terms of location (the middle of the study watershed group) and size (366 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>), are plotted in Figs 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref>, respectively. The amount of the variation in the projected precipitation did not change over time, but under RCP 8.5, the amount was more substantial than that under RCP 4.5 (Figs. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref>). Under the RCP 4.5 scenario, the GCMs predicted that the overall precipitation and temperature of the Ohio Basin watersheds increased at the rates of 0.51 mm/a and 0.28 °C/a, respectively, which correspond to the slopes of the linear trend lines of Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>. The rates increased to 1.25 mm/a and 0.64 °C/a for precipitation and temperature, respectively, under the RCP 8.5 scenario. As seen in Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref>, the variations in the precipitation ensemble are higher than those in the temperature ensemble, which indicates the projection of precipitation is more susceptible to the selection of GCMs than is that of temperature.
