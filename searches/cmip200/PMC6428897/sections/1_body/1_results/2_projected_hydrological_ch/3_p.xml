<p id="Par14" class="p">Simulated ensemble hydrographs showed unique watershed wise variations depending on the hydrological component (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S5</xref>). In the cases of QQ, DR, GW, PET, ET, and WA (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S5</xref>), the spatial (across watersheds: the heights of boxes, and the ranges between the maximum and minimum depths) and seasonal variations in the projections made for the far future (2070 to 2079) under the RCP 8.5 scenario were larger than those in the projections provided by the RCP 4.5 scenario for the near future projection, implying higher uncertainty regarding far future hydrological projections that are under extreme emission scenarios. The projections of DR showed greater seasonal variations than those of GW, which is in agreement with our understandings, whereby the response of surface flow to rainfall is more direct than that of groundwater. The high seasonal variations found in the PET projections, ranging from 5 mm to 350 mm, were damped in the ET projections due to the interactions between soil particles and water that are expressed by the water holding capacity of soil (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S5</xref>). The projections of SS and WA were widely and symmetrically distributed across the watersheds during each month, demonstrating the hydrological variety of the selected watersheds. The annual and monthly watershed hydrology projections show that the multi-GCM and multi-parameter ensemble averages could reasonably describe the overall hydrological response of the Ohio River watersheds to climate projections.
