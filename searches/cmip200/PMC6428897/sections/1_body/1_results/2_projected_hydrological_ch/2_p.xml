<p id="Par13" class="p">Overall, the annual averages of precipitation (PP), total runoff or streamflow (QQ), direct runoff (DR), groundwater (DR), and evapotranspiration (ET) were projected to increase when compared to those of the baseline (or historical) period under the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). The projected increase rates of the hydrological components including QQ, DR, and GW were higher than those of PP (6.8% and 8.8% for the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios, respectively), which is in agreement with projections reported in the literature

 </sup>, indicating that the projected precipitation changes can be amplified in the runoff hydrographs (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Such amplification happens as the projected precipitation increases concentrate on winter and spring (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1(A,B)</xref>) when soil water content (SS) is relatively high (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S5</xref>) in the study watersheds. The potential ET (PET) was expected to increase at rates similar to those of the TAV (average air temperature) and PP, while the ET did not change as much as did the TAV, PP, and PET due to the projected decreases of the infiltration and SS (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). The available water (WA) of the watersheds was predicted to increase by 1.6% and 1.5% under the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios, respectively, which implies that the overall amount of the water resources may not decrease in the future due to the projected increases in PP in the Ohio River watersheds.
