<p id="Par21" class="p">The contribution of each GCM to the uncertainty in the GCM ensembles varied depending on the types of hydrological components (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>). Overall, the amount of uncertainty contributed by the climate change projections made using BCC, GCESS, CCCMA, CSIRO-QCCCE, and LASG-CESS for the Ohio River Basin watersheds were larger than those of INM, IPSL, and MIROC. Furthermore, uncertainty in the precipitation projections made by some GCMs was large while uncertainty in their temperature projections was small, and vice versa. It will be useful to identify which models contribute the most to the uncertainty of an ensemble projection, as we can focus on such models first when trying to reduce uncertainty contained in the ensemble projection by screening unrealistic modeling results. In addition, when it is not feasible to include all GCMs and their projections in a climate change impact study and its uncertainty analysis, the uncertainty information such as Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref> can provide guidance to researchers to make appropriate and fair model selections. On the other hand, uncertainty in the following three GCMs was relatively small for both climate variables in the Ohio River watersheds: CMCC-CMS, IPSL-CM5A-LR_1, and IPSL-CM5A-LR_4.
