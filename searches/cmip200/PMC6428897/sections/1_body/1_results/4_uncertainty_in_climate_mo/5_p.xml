<p id="Par23" class="p">The correlation structure between the amount of uncertainty in QQ and the selected hydrological features of the watersheds was explored to see if uncertainty magnitudes can be predicted on the basis of watershed characteristics (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9</xref>). Both multi-parameter and multi-GCM uncertainty were moderately (0.5 &lt; R &lt; 0.8

 </sup>) correlated to the longitudes of the mass centers of the watersheds and the fraction of baseflow in streamflow. As seen in Figs. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>, there are gradual changes in climate and the degree of projected temperature increases from southwest to northeast. The correlation analysis shows that uncertainty magnitude decreases as moving to the east of the basin (longitudes increase from −88° 30′ to −78° 00′), indicating a mild temperate or humid subtropical climate (southwest) may have relatively large uncertainty in hydrological analysis of climate change than a humid continental climate (northeast) in the basin. In addition, uncertainty was relatively small in watersheds with high average annual baseflow indices (BFIs), which well corresponds to Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>. In the figures, the amount of multi-parameter and multi-GCM uncertainty associated with groundwater (GW) is relatively small compared to those of the other hydrological components.
