<p id="Par19" class="p">The selection of climate model was an order of magnitude more influential on uncertainty in the QQ, DR, and ET projections than that of parameter selection, but it was not always the case for GW and PET (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> to 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). In the case of QQ, the overall average uncertainty in the monthly multi-GCM ensemble projection ranged from 113% (99.3 mm) to 164% (160.4 mm) of monthly precipitation under RCP 4.5 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). Uncertainty in the QQ projections was greater in winter than in other seasons, and it was dominated by the GCM selection uncertainty in the DR projections. The GW prediction was relatively less responsive to the GCM selection compared to those of QQ, DR, and ET (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>). The GCM selection was much more influential on the ET projection than the PET since ET is controlled by not only temperature but also SS that is sensitive to GCM selection. The monthly variation patterns of uncertainty in the PET projections were opposite to those of the DR projections in both the multi-GCM and multi-parameter ensemble cases, implying that the impact of the PET prediction uncertainty on DR projections is limited (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). Uncertainty in the WA projections due to the GCM selection was 2 to 4 times larger than uncertainty in the PP projections, indicating the significance of GCM selection in a climate change impact analysis.
