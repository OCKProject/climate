<p id="Par34" class="p">A total of 22 GCMs and their variants were considered in this study so that the wide ranges of mathematical representations and climate process simulation strategies could be considered, and the largest uncertainty in the multi-GCM ensembles could be explored. When the amount of uncertainty is expressed in the depth unit (mm) at monthly and annual scales, it was turned out that uncertainty in hydrological component projections made using the multi-GCM is considerably large compared to the rainfall depth projected, indicating a GCM selection can substantially affect the hydrological analysis of climate change (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). Such finding suggested that a map showing the ranges (uncertainty) and trends of the precipitation and temperature projections should be built using multiple GCMs, or hopefully all of them—which are used in the global scale climate projections for watersheds (e.g. 8- or 12-digit Hydrologic Unit Code watersheds)—to guide the field of hydrological modeling for more effective GCM selection in the climate change studies for local watersheds.
