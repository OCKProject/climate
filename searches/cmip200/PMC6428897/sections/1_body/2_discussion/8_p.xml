<p id="Par31" class="p">The sampling-based optimization algorithm, Shuffled Complex Evolution – University Arizona (SCE-UA), was used to identify parameter sets providing acceptable performance in this study, and the algorithm has been known to be capable of locating a solution close to the global optimum

 </sup>. The heuristic features of the algorithm could reveal the equifinality of the model’s watershed representation, but the ranges of identified parameter values would be dependent on calibration algorithms used due to their unique sampling strategies and subsequent efficiency
