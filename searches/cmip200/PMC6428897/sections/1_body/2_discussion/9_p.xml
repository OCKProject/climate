<p id="Par32" class="p">The use of different models, calibration and uncertainty analysis methods may bring results different from what we have here. Assuming that observations are only enough to regulate major parameters in calibration, however, overparameterization is likely to increase equifinality and uncertainty

 </sup>. The parsimonious structure of a simple model such as ABCD can minimize the possibility of overparameterization and then reduce parameter uncertainty. Thus, the amount of multi-parameter uncertainty quantified in this study may represent one of the optimistic cases on the side of hydrological modeling. Such a speculation implies that the use of more process-based models that usually have a relatively large number of parameters may increase hydrological modeling uncertainty especially when additional measurements that can constrain model behavior are not incorporated in parameter calibration.
