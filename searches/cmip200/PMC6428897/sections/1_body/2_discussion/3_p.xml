<p id="Par26" class="p">The uncertainty of hydrological projections, especially for runoff, was much more closely correlated to the uncertainty of projections for precipitation than temperature, suggesting that the reliability of the precipitation projections made by GCMs needs to be investigated for a robust hydrological analysis of climate change. Overall, the results demonstrate how a subjective selection of climate models and hydrological model parameter values can affect the hydrological assessment of climate change and highlight the importance of quantitative uncertainty analysis for improved reliability of the assessment. We also could examine the contributions of each GCM to uncertainty in a multi-GCM ensemble. The GCM uncertainty contributions quantified using the newly introduced analysis strategy would be useful information and indicator to screen GCMs in creating precise ensemble hydrological projections. The selection of GCMs can be guided by various information including the amount of uncertainty in projections, the accuracy of reproducing historical data (or observations), perceived accuracy of climate models (based on an understanding of the simulation mechanisms), and the overall performance reported in literature. This study presents a method to quantify and compare the contribution of GCMs to uncertainty in precipitation and temperature projections, as demonstrated in Fig.Â
