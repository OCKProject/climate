<p id="Par25" class="p">GCMs that contribute to the uncertainty of hydrological projections vary by months (as Equation 
 <xref rid="Equ9" ref-type="" class="xref">9</xref> is applied to individual months). In the case of “03232500”, for instance, the numbers of months in which each GCM provided the upper limits vary as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig" class="xref">10A</xref>. In addition, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig" class="xref">10B</xref> shows variations in the numbers of months in which each GCM provided the upper limits of the WA projections made for the watersheds. Such results demonstrate that all GCMs (rather than a few ones) are partially responsible for uncertainty in multi-GCM ensemble predictions, and their contributions to uncertainty vary by months.
