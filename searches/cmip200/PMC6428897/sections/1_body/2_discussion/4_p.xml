<p id="Par27" class="p">This study showed that relatively fast hydrologic components such as direct runoff are more sensitive to the uncertainty of the GCM ensemble compared to the equifinality of the hydrological model. Thus, the impact of uncertainty in ensemble precipitation and temperature projections on the hydrological analysis of climate change are expected to be larger in a small local watershed whose hydrological responses tend to be dominated by direct runoff. Some GCMs produced greater uncertainty in the hydrological projections than other GCMs, but an investigation on the relationship between the characteristics of climate models and their contributions to the overall uncertainty was beyond of the scope of this study. We employed a statistical bias-correction method developed by Ho

 </sup> in this study; thus the use of different bias-correction methods may lead to different analysis results. However, we believe it won’t change our conclusion as the differences between data bias-corrected by statistical and dynamical downscaling methods are not substantial when the same GCMs were employed, especially at a monthly scale
