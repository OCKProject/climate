<p id="Par24" class="p">This study systematically compared the influence of uncertainty in temperature and precipitation projections on various hydrological variables at the local watershed scale. The results showed that the uncertainty of GCM projections are dominant for relatively rapid hydrological components while the uncertainty of parameterization is more significant for slow components. The study demonstrated that all GCMs (rather than a few one) contribute uncertainty in multi-GCM ensemble predictions, and their contributions vary by watersheds and months, suggesting the needs for the reliability assessment of GCM projections when developing watershed-scale management plans. The findings also suggest that the selection of both GCMs and parameters should be carefully made to improve the robustness of a hydrological assessment of climate change.</p>
