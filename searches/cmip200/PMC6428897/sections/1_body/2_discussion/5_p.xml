<p id="Par28" class="p">This study included watersheds whose hydrological responses to rainfall and temperature could be reproduced and explained with a simple water balance model, ABCD. Thus, the results may not apply to watersheds to which the model is not applicable. Although the applicability of the ABCD model to the Ohio basin has been proven

 </sup>, and only ABCD models successfully calibrated to streamflow were included in this study, the representation of water balance partitioning varies by models. Thus, a hydrological model different from ABCD will provide simulation results different from what this study obtained. It may be worth investigating whether the use of other hydrological models calibrated at an accuracy level similar to that of this study may affect the conclusions (model structure equifinality vs. model parameter equifinality). However, such examination is beyond the scope of this study.
