<p id="Par38" class="p">While ice coverage in winter is for long time (still) different to summer conditions, we do not find that it is a decisive obstacle for energy production. Even though the Kara Sea (WSP2) is not ice free in the winter irrespective of the climate scenario, and also a significant part of the assessment unit off West Greenland is ice covered, in both cases the sea ice is thin enough to allow both for floating production units as well as LNG export. This is especially relevant as floating production units are the cheapest options for gas production in the Arctic (cf. TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Differences in the analyzed climate scenarios do not lead to significant differences regarding the accessibility of the European Arctic Ocean for oil and gas production, at least not in the very likely spots studied here.
