<p id="Par40" class="p">Regarding autonomous subsea production, the remoteness of the North Barents Sea is a significant hindrance. Subsea production is dependent on a floating storage and processing unit on the surface or, more commonly, on a receiving plant onshore. While a land base is theoretically thinkable on Franz Josef Land, in practice this is hardly feasible due to the remoteness and harsh environmental conditions on the island. We leave subsea production in combination with FPSU still in the technology portfolio, but operation in the North Barents Sea remains relatively unlikely.</p>
