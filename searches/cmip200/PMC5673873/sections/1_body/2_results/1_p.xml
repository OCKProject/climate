<p id="Par36" class="p">We combine the information from the suitability of a technology and the sea ice projections with data on bathymetry and step-out distance. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> above shows the step-out distance and bathymetry for the assessment areas in question, as well as international boundaries taken from IBRU (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">2012</xref>). The threshold values for step-out distance and bathymetry correspond to those in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>. Since most of the assessment units in question include landmass, each in principle comprises possible locations that allow for all technologies in question. Since we are interested in offshore oil and gas production, we do not consider shallow water production. Deep water prohibits the use of fixed platforms in the North and South Barents Sea (EBB2 and EBB3). Subsea and floating production technology remains possible in any assessment areas.
