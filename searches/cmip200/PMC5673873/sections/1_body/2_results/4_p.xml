<p id="Par39" class="p">Next to bathymetry and sea ice conditions a number of additional factors impact on technology choice in the Arctic Ocean. The frequent presence of icebergs off the coast of West Greenland poses an immense risk to fixed platforms there. Contrary to floating platforms, fixed platforms cannot be uncoupled from the well and moved in the emergency that an approaching iceberg on collision course cannot be diverted by service vessels. The same environmental constraints occur to floating platforms, but due to the use of an emergency uncoupling feature the overall operating risk is lower for this family of platforms.</p>
