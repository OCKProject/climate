<p id="Par37" class="p">Regarding ice conditions, we have to distinguish between summer and winter ice conditions. Fixed and subsea technologies can generally cope with harsh conditions and can be employed if ice conditions are favorable only in summer, where a time window with manageable ice conditions (1.5 m ice thickness or less) is needed for initial construction and maintenance. Floating production units as well as LNG carriers and tankers, however, need year-round sufficiently low ice thickness under 1.5 m. FigureÂ 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref> shows the average projected summer ice thickness in 2040 in the assessment areas under study, highlighting the 1.5 m thickness border for the climate scenarios with low (upper panel) and high (lower panel) radiative forcing. We concentrate on 2040 in order to get an idea of the long-run prospect and in order to get an idea about the potential impact of climate policy and climate change on the prospects for energy production in the Arctic Ocean. Even though the differences in ice thickness in the higher Arctic Ocean are visible, we can conclude that even in the scenario with relatively little climate change (RCP 4.5) offshore oil or gas production in the European Arctic Ocean in all assessment areas in question is not substantially hindered by summer sea ice.
