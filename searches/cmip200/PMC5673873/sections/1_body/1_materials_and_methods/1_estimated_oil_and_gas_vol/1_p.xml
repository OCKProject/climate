<p id="Par14" class="p">The more favorable the pre-drilling conditions are in terms of the size of fields, the distance to existing infrastructure, bathymetry, as well as weather and ice conditions, the more likely are exploration drilling campaigns in this area and, consequently, later production of hydrocarbons. Today, the USGS’ Circum-Arctic Resource Appraisal (USGS-CARA 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">2008a</xref>; Gautier et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">2009</xref>) provides the most recent information on potential volumes for predefined assessment unit. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> shows estimated volumes from the USGS-CARA for the ten largest European assessment units north of the Arctic Circle with regard to potential gas or oil volumes. To account for the size of assessment units in the European Arctic with the highest gas and oil potential, but also for differences in bathymetry and future ice conditions, our analysis focuses on the following four assessment units: the “South Kara Sea” (WSB2), the “South Barents Basin and Ludlov Saddle” (EBB2), the “North Barents Basin” (EBB3), and the “Northwest Greenland Rifted Margin” (WGEC2).
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1" class="xref">1</xref> The four assessment units also represent a wide coverage of jurisdictions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Both the Kara Sea and parts of the Barents Sea areas are in the Russian continental shelf, the larger part of the Barents Sea is in the Norwegian EEZ (including the continental shelf) and the West Greenland assessment unit is under Danish, or rather Greenland’s jurisdiction. While fields in the southern Barents Sea are already under exploitation and infrastructure is already developed, the other three assessment units are more distant from e.g., port infrastructure and generally less developed.
