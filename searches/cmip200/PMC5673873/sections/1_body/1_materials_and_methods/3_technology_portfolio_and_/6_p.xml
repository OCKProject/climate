<p id="Par30" class="p">It is important to note that deepwater areas, which are permanently ice covered, are very complicated (or even today not possible) to develop. This is caused by the need to get (vertical) access to the production wells for planned and emergency workover drilling and maintenance works by means of dedicated vessels (ships or semi-submersibles) and remotely operated vehicles (ROV). Directional drilling from aside (from onshore) is not feasible when the distance to the well exceeds about 8 km (4.32 nautical miles). Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref> gives a summary of the feasibility assumptions.
