<p id="Par26" class="p">Fixed platforms are used where the water depth does not exceed roughly 250 m and where especially harsh environmental conditions like large waves, strong winds and currents, and drifting ice or icebergs are present. A number of production facilities in the Arctic are installed in shallow or very shallow waters with water depths ranging from 5 to 20 m. When concrete platforms are used these often provide large storage capacity in the hull structure allowing to temporarily store and export the product via shuttle tankers (discontinuous export). Alternatively and in case of water depth restriction, export of the products can also be realized by means of pipelines to backup treatment plants and further to the local network (continuous export). Such continuous pipeline connection could be used to produce LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas), CNG (Compressed Natural Gas), or GTL (Gas to Liquids) in a specialized treatment plant, allowing further long distance exports to clients worldwide.</p>
