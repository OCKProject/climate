<p id="Par29" class="p">The choice of the actual production technology employed at a given location depends on a number of environmental constraints, most importantly step-out distance, water depth, wave conditions (height, spectra, periods, and current), ice condition (type, thickness, extent, icebergs, ridges, drifting speed), and wind conditions (spectra, speed, gust). Assuming iceberg management for all technologies, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref> shows the available technology for offshore oil and gas extraction in the Arctic depending on field size, water depth, and distance to shore. A FLNG floating platform, for example, is best moored in up to 1500 m water depth, installed in a step-out distance to shore exceeding 300 km and designed with LNG production capacity of up to e.g., 3.6 MTPA.
