An installation is considered remote if it is located more than 40 nautical miles from the nearest manned installation or airport/heliport. Consequently, consideration should be given to provide Jet-A1 refueling facilities, where the distance from shore to an installation or vessel (with an operational helideck) exceeds 50Â nautical miles.</p>
