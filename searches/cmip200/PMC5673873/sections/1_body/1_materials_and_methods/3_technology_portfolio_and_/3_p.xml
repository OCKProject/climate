<p id="Par27" class="p">Floating platforms can be designed to work in even harsher environments and especially in deep water conditions. An example is the FPSO (Floating Production, Storage, and Offloading) technology, where a floating terminal vessel (ship shaped or barge type) comprises capacity for production, processing, and storing of hydrocarbons. The product can be exported either via shuttle tanker (mostly if the step-out distance exceeds roughly 200Â km) or via pipeline, depending on cost effectiveness. All floating production units are permanently moored to the seafloor. Most units can be temporarily disconnected from the moorings in emergency, e.g., when large icebergs or excessive thick drifting ice approaches, which cannot be managed by ice-breaking service vessels.</p>
