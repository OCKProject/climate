<p id="Par28" class="p">The latest development is the subsea processing technology where no permanently floating or fixed platform is required for production. Instead the production facilities are directly installed on the seafloor so that the environment at the sea surface does not harm the operations. These facilities export the products via pipeline to shore (so called subsea to beach (S2B) configuration) or via flowlines and risers to floating storage or production and storage facilities, such as FSOs (Floating Storage and Offloading facilities), FPSOs, or FLNG (Floating Liquefied Natural Gas (Production, Storage and Offloading)). It should be mentioned that each production unit mainly dedicated to gas production (or to oil production) will also produce condensate (comparable to oil) or associated gas and vice versa, which also has to be handled, or even stored and exported at the floating facility.</p>
