Different realizations of the same model experiment are called ensemble members. All ensemble members of 34 CMIP5 models are compared to the sea ice concentration product OSISAF

 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>a for the period 1979–2005. The very large range of simulated past sea ice areas in the CMIP5 models reveals that not all models are suitable for our analysis. Most models overestimate the sea ice area as well as the amplitude of the seasonal cycle. Therefore, we select four CMIP5 models on the basis of the model observation misfit from sea ice concentration in our target areas as well as in the entire Arctic. We compare the mean seasonal cycle for two time periods 1979–2005 and 1992–2005 of each ensemble member with OSI SAF and a second sea ice concentration product, SSM/I.
