<p id="Par22" class="p">Turning to the change of future seasonal cycle, the magnitude of the sea ice area seasonal cycle in all four models is similar during the period 1979–2005. In contrast, the magnitude of the seasonal cycle differs in the models for the period 2025–2040 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>c). The NorESM1-ME and the CCSM4 show an increase in magnitude of the seasonal cycle for the target area EBB3: the maximum sea ice area is similar for the past and the future time period in March, while the minimum sea ice area decreases by 0.1–0.2 million km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> in September for the future time period. The ice melts faster in spring indicated by steeper gradients. This occurs in contrast to the gradient of the ice area increase during autumn and winter, which remains similar in both time periods. The freezing process takes longer before the maximum ice area is reached in March.
