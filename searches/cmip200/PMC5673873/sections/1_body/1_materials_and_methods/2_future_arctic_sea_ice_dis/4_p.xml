Although the models simulate similar sea ice distributions for recent decades, their simulations of the September ice-covered area differ substantially for the coming decades. The variability induced by the emission scenarios RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 is small in comparison with inter- and intra-model variability. Its magnitude is about 0.05 million km
