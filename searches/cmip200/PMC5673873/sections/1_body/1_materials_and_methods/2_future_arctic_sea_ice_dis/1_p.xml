<p id="Par16" class="p">It is impossible to predict the Arctic sea ice distribution for the coming decades. However, global climate models are able to estimate likely sea ice distributions under assumed emission scenarios. Global coupled models are used in standardized experiments, known as the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5), to project possible climate change magnitudes until 2100 (Taylor et al.

The selected models are further analyzed to estimate the future sea ice distribution in our four target areas. We focus on results from the emission scenarios RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 (Moss et al.
