<p id="Par20" class="p">Those four models with the lowest misfit in the target areas as well as in the entire Arctic are CCSM4, GFDL-CM3, MPI-ESM-LR, and NorESM1-ME (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>b). Note, that the number of ensemble members ranges from one (NorESM1-ME) to six (CCSM4) for the historical simulation of the models. The number of ensemble members varies also with the experimental design: historical, RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5. Multiple ensemble members are needed to reveal the natural variability; the internal, unforced variability that occurs in nature as in model simulations for complex systems. This variability is relatively small in the historical simulation between 1979 and 2005 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>b) with largest values of up to 0.1 million km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> in the GFDL-CM3. This variability increases for the CCSM4 and the GFDL-CM3 in the scenario simulation RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 with the largest variability of about 3.5 million km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> in the CCSM4 RCP 4.5. Note that the GFDL-CM3 has only one ensemble member for the RCP 8.5 simulation, thus determination of internal variability is uncertain.
