<p id="Par43" class="p">At the same time we project that further sea ice reduction in the course of climate change will not be pivotal for offshore energy production in the European Arctic. Our analysis of a variety of global climate models indicates that, while in itself significant, the difference in sea ice conditions between the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios even in 2040 is not decisive for the suitability or employment of the relevant production technologies: Scenario results suggest that in 2040, the ice has receded enough to make gas production technologically feasible in relevant areas even under RCP 4.5. This finding notwithstanding, we also show that climate change may of course have an impact north of the areas under study here. On economic grounds, recent oil and gas price developments, which give some indication of the upper limit of the highest marginal production cost in the market today, suggest that Arctic oil and gas will not be competitive in the near future. Also, in the light of global climate policies and protection goals, one might expect a decline in demand of fossil fuels questioning the rationality of exploiting Arctic oil and gas.</p>
