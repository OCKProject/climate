<p id="Par41" class="p">Both floating and subsea systems are applicable in all assessment areas under study, even though the operation of subsea systems in the North Barents Sea remains unlikely. From TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref> we know that production costs of natural gas amount to about 3.30 EUR per million British thermal unit (mmBtu) for floating systems and 4.05 EUR/mmBtu for subsea systems; for crude oil they are about 18.70 EUR/barrel for floating systems and 23.10 EUR/barrel for subsea systems. These numbers refer to a system with offshore processing, storage, and offloading, as we are focusing on offshore production, but processing, storage, and offloading onshore is not qualitatively different. All numbers were estimated in 2012. As is the case with any scenario analysis, our projections do only hold true under the assumptions posed by the global climate models. A similar caveat holds for the bottom-up, technology-driven cost estimates.
