<p id="Par13" class="p">In the course of the paper we will first describe estimates of oil and gas potential in the European offshore Arctic, then analyze results from global climate models to draw conclusions on Arctic sea ice development in 2040 under two climate scenarios. We then present results from a bottom-up, engineering-based cost estimation exercise for a wide variety of technologies for offshore oil and gas production. Finally, we combine these results to estimate likely production costs in various exemplary Arctic regions. We conclude by showing that under current hydrocarbon prices, oil and gas from the European offshore Arctic are not competitive on world markets. At the same time, the impact of a changing accessibility of the Arctic Ocean under climate change on the operability of production technologies as well as economics of production is only minor.</p>
