<p id="Par11" class="p">We show for the most resource-abundant European Arctic Seas whether and how a climate change-induced reduction in sea ice might impact future accessibility of offshore natural gas and crude oil resources. Based on this analysis we show for a number of illustrative but representative locations which technology options are likely based on a cost-minimization assessment. We contribute to the literature by combining geology-based assessments with climate model-based projections on sea ice development, engineering-based technology assessments, and information on global oil and gas prices to assess economic viability of offshore oil and gas production in the European Arctic.</p>
