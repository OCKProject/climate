<p id="Par44" class="p">Significant volumes of oil and natural gas resources are assumed in the Arctic Ocean. While their exploitation has not been feasible due to unfavorable climate and geographic conditions until today, global warming might improve accessibility in times to come. In this paper, we have shown that for parts of the European Arctic Seas, an exploitation of oil and gas might be technologically possible in the future. However, under current prices and with competing fossil and renewable energy sources, an exploitation does not seem to be rational from an economic point of view.</p>
