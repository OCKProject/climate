  <p class="p">March (a) and September (b) mean sea ice thickness in m for the region EBB3 from four CMIP5 models with the emission scenarios RCP 4.5 (solid lines) and RCP 8.5 (dashed lines). Note: If more than one ensemble member is available per model, the mean is shown by the line and the range over all ensemble members per model is indicated by the shading. Overall, the four chosen models agree on a reduction of September sea ice area until 2040. However, not all models project a reduction of March sea ice area. All four models show a large annual variability. For sea ice thickness the annual variability is larger than the long-term reduction until 2040</p>
