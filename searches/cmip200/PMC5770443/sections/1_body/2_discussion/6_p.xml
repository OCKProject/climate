<p id="Par27" class="p">The uncertainty in the response of the global dust loading to future climate changes contributes to large uncertainties in the direct dust–climate feedback on both global and regional scales (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). Although our methodology quantifies and propagates this uncertainty, it has a number of important limitations that nonetheless likely cause a substantial underestimation of the uncertainty in the direct dust–climate feedback (see Methods). This arises because the direct dust–climate feedback depends on a wide range of processes in the Earth system, many of which remain uncertain

 </sup>, and this study is able to quantify the uncertainty for only a subset of these processes (see Methods). Furthermore, the model projections of future dust loading changes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>) might be affected by large biases in representing one or more of the processes that drive changes in the dust cycle, which are not quantified by the uncertainties propagated here. The presence of such biases is indicated by the inability of CMIP5 models to reproduce historical changes in dust
