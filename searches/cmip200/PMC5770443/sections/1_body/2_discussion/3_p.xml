<p id="Par24" class="p">These results suggest that the direct dust–climate feedback will play an important role in shaping the future climate near major source regions, as has likely occurred in the past

 </sup>. In idealized modeling experiments, the equilibrium surface and atmospheric temperature response to dust direct radiative forcing scales with the TOA forcing
 <sup class="sup">

 </sup>. Thus, the direct forcing patterns in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5a</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">d</xref> imply enhanced surface and atmospheric warming over the Saharan and Arabian deserts, where there is already an amplified response to global warming

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>
 </sup>. Over water, the cooling is strongest in the tropical North Atlantic and over the Arabian Sea. In the North Atlantic, the meridional asymmetry in the forcing would likely excite a coupled response—the Atlantic Meridional Mode—resulting in a southward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, thus weakening the West African Monsoon

 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">42</xref>
 </sup> and the increased dust loading
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">43</xref>
 </sup> would both conspire to inhibit tropical cyclone formation and intensification over the North Atlantic. Over the Arabian Sea, the dust forcing would weaken the climatological northward meridional sea surface temperature (SST) gradient and amplify the cooling associated with absorbing aerosols emitted from the Indian Subcontinent, weakening the monsoonal circulation and possibly improving conditions for the formation of very strong tropical cyclones there
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">41</xref>
 </sup>. The warming over the Sahara would increase the land-sea temperature gradient, which could strengthen the summer monsoon’s northward penetration into the continent
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">43</xref>
 </sup>. Indeed, it is thought that the enhanced rainfall of the African Humid Period (AHP), which was a period of 15–5 kyr BP when the Sahara was almost completely vegetated and supported perennial lakes, was the result of orbital forcing that similarly enhanced the land-sea temperature gradient
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">44</xref>
 </sup>. However, studies have also shown that the enhanced monsoonal rainfall of the AHP was also encouraged by a reduction in the concentration of dust over the continent
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">45</xref>
 </sup>, as heating by an elevated dust layer reduces rainfall by increasing atmospheric static stability
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">44</xref>
 </sup>. Thus, the impact on the West African Monsoon may be a balance between the partitioning of dust atmospheric heating and surface forcing.
