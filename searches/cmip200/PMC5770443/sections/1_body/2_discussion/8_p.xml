<p id="Par29" class="p">This paper provided the first explicit estimation of the dust–climate feedback due to changes in the direct radiative effect. We did so by using a simple theoretical framework for the direct dust–climate feedback (Eq. 
 <xref rid="Equ4" ref-type="" class="xref">4</xref>) that combines recent constraints on the global dust DRE
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>
 </sup> with a series of model simulations of the dust cycle’s response to climate changes. A subset of these simulations used a recent physically explicit dust emission parameterization
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>
 </sup>, which increased model skill in reproducing past changes in dust emissions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>), thereby lending some limited confidence in predictions of the dust cycle response to future climate changes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). A major advantage of our approach over simply using ensembles of climate model results is that it allows for both the explicit inclusion of experimental and observational constraints on dust properties and abundance
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>
 </sup>, and the propagation of many (but not all; see Methods) of the uncertainties that affect the direct dust–climate feedback (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). Our results suggest that global dust loading could change by about −5 to +10% per degree of globally averaged surface temperature increase (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>), resulting in a global direct dust–climate feedback in the range of −0.04 to +0.02 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>K
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). As such, the global direct dust–climate feedback is likely of the order of one percent of the total physical feedbacks in the climate system
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">25</xref>
 </sup>, and could account for a large fraction of the total aerosol feedbacks
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">29</xref>
 </sup>. Since the direct dust–climate feedback can be enhanced by over an order of magnitude close to source regions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>), it could play an important role in shaping the future climates of North Africa, the Mediterranean, the Sahel, the Middle East, and Central Asia.
