<p id="Par26" class="p">Although it remains an open question whether global dust loading will increase or decrease in the future, our results suggest that current climate models might underestimate the dust cycle’s response to climate change. In particular, we find that accounting for the additional physics included in the K14 emission scheme enhances the sensitivity of the dust cycle to climate changes, which might have contributed to an improved ability to reproduce observed long-term changes in dust AOD (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Specifically, the K14 parameterization accounts for the increase in the emitted vertical dust flux per unit of horizontal saltation flux that occurs when soils become more erodible, which for instance arises from the predicted future drying of soils on most deserts margins

 </sup> (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">5</xref>). The net effect of accounting for this and other additional physics is a near-doubling of the increase in dust emissions per degree surface temperature change (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>), causing it to exceed the range spanned by CMIP5 models (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). This result suggests that empirical dust emission parameterizations in current climate models, which do not account for the increase in dust emissions per unit saltation flux that occurs as soils become more erodible, and instead generally use dust source functions to parameterize spatial variability in emissions
