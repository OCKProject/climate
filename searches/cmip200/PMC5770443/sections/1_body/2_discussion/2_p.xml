<p id="Par23" class="p">Our results indicate that the sign and magnitude of the direct dust–climate feedback varies greatly on regional scales (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). This occurs in part because of large spatial variability in dust loading, and in part because the global dust DRE is the sum of counteracting cooling and warming effects that are both modulated by a variety of factors. Dust cooling effects arise from scattering of SW radiation, which dominates for fine dust and is enhanced over dark surfaces

 </sup>. In contrast, dust warming effects arise from scattering of LW radiation and absorption of SW and LW radiation

 </sup>. The dependence of the radiative effects on particle size causes the fining of the dust size distribution during long-range transport to produce a gradual shift from warming interactions to cooling interactions. However, this effect is often overwhelmed by the coincident shift from high albedo deserts close to source regions to low albedo ocean and vegetated surfaces further from source regions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">6</xref>). Indeed, we find that the regional direct dust–climate feedback over very bright surfaces (the high albedo deserts of North Africa and the Middle East, and ice or snow-covered regions) is of opposite sign to that over dark surfaces (primarily oceans and vegetated regions) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref> and Supplementary Figs. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">7</xref>). This causes the dust DRE and climate feedback to display a dipole pattern between the highly reflective deserts of North Africa and the Middle East, and their surrounding oceanic and vegetated regions. This dipole does not emerge for other source regions, such as the Australian and Chinese deserts, because those source regions are less reflective. In addition to these regional variations in its sign, the magnitude of the direct dust–climate feedback is greatly enhanced close to source regions, where dust loading is much greater than the global average (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">8</xref>). In particular, we find that the direct dust–climate feedback is of the order of one to several tenths of a Wm
