 </sup>. Since aerosols are largely advected from upwind locations, and since aerosol feedbacks do not arise from a local thermodynamic response, there is less causal relation between temperature and aerosol loading at a given location. Consequently, defining the regional feedback relative to the local temperature change would not capture the physical processes (e.g., upwind changes in wind speed, vegetation, soil moisture, and precipitation) that ultimately drive local changes in aerosol concentration and radiative effects. We have therefore defined the regional direct dustâ€“climate feedback as relative to the change in global surface temperature. Equation (
 <xref rid="Equ5" ref-type="" class="xref">5</xref>) should thus be interpreted as the change in the regional energy balance induced by the response of dust aerosol loading to global climate changes, for which changes in the globally averaged surface temperature serves as a proxy.
