<p id="Par14" class="p">To address these limitations of CMIP5 simulations in estimating 
 <italic class="italic">κ</italic>, we perform additional simulations with the Community Earth System Model (CESM). For these simulations, we (i) set future land use equal to that of the present day to isolate the dust cycle’s response to climate change

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>
 </sup>, and (iii) evaluate whether the model can reproduce past changes in dust emissions. We describe these CESM simulations in detail in the Methods section, and summarize them here briefly. We conducted three simulations with both the default (BASE) CESM dust emission module
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">19</xref>
 </sup> and the more physically based (PHYS) dust emission model of Kok et al.
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>
 </sup>, for a total of six simulations. This new emission scheme, hereafter referred to as K14, has been shown to both better reproduce small-scale dust emission measurements

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">21</xref>
 </sup> and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>). Two of the three simulations with each dust module were driven by reanalysis meteorology, and were used to test the model’s ability to reproduce historical changes in dust emissions, as captured by two data sets that serve as a proxy for dust emission. The first data set is a satellite-derived long-term record of dust aerosol optical depth (AOD) off the West African coast around Cape Verde. Dust AOD in this region is dominated by the main dust plume blowing across the Atlantic Ocean from North Africa, and is thus a proxy for the intensity of North African dust emissions

 </sup>. Our second data set consists of measurements of AOD from the AERONET network of ground-based sun photometers
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>
 </sup>, namely at eight stations near dust source regions for which long–term changes in AOD are due to changes in dustiness (see Methods). The third simulation used the land component of CESM, the Community Land Model (CLM)
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">24</xref>
 </sup>, to simulate the response of the global dust emission rate to future climate changes, which we use as a proxy for global dust loading

 <xref rid="Equ4" ref-type="" class="xref">4</xref>) and (
 <xref rid="Equ5" ref-type="" class="xref">5</xref>) to estimate the direct dust–climate feedback (see Methods).
