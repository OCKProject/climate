<p id="Par16" class="p">The comparison of CESM simulations against AERONET measurements shows that the BASE dust module has limited skill in reproducing observed long-term trends (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>), producing a correlation coefficient of 0.50 between measured and modeled long-term trends (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b</xref>). Using the PHYS dust module improves the simulated long-term trend at most stations, resulting in an improved correlation coefficient of 0.83.
