<p id="Par15" class="p">We found that CESM’s BASE dust module substantially underestimates both the AOD off the West-African coast, and its relative rate of decline over the past few decades (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref>), although this is somewhat sensitive to which reanalysis meteorology data set is used

 </sup>. Using the PHYS dust module with the physically based K14 emission scheme helps to resolve both these problems. First, the magnitude of the dust AOD is brought in better agreement with measurements, because the K14 scheme shifts emissions to the more erodible regions in Western Africa (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> in ref. 
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">21</xref>
 </sup>), which results in a greater dust AOD over the tropical North Atlantic. Second, CESM with the PHYS module better captures the historical decline in dust AOD since the 1980s, which is likely largely due to a historical decrease in wind speed over the North African source regions

 </sup> (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref>). CESM’s improved performance with the PHYS module is thus likely due in part to a more accurate representation of Western Africa source regions, as well as possibly due to improvements in the scaling of dust emissions with wind speed, and the increased sensitivity of dust emissions to climate changes (particularly due to changes in soil moisture) in K14.
