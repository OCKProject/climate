<p id="Par13" class="p">In order to estimate the direct dust–climate feedback using the framework above, we need to quantify the change in dust loading per degree globally averaged surface temperature change (
 <italic class="italic">κ</italic>). We do so using an ensemble of the subset of simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) that included prognostic treatments of dust aerosols

 </sup> (see Methods). However, these simulations have three important limitations. First, CMIP5 simulations include projected future land use changes, such that it is not clear which part of the simulated dust loading change is due to land use changes, which are considered anthropogenic emissions and thus a radiative forcing

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">30</xref>
 </sup>, and which part is due to the response of the dust cycle to climate changes, which gives rise to the dust–climate feedback. Second, the ability of many CMIP5 models to project future dust cycle changes is limited by their use of empirical dust emission parameterizations to parameterize the spatial variability of dust emissions

 </sup>. Third, although many CMIP5 models are able to reproduce important features of the historical warming trends

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>
 </sup>, CMIP5 models have not been shown able to reproduce historical trends in dust loading without forcing changes in dust sources
