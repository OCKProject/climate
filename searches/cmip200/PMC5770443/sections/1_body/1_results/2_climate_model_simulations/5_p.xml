<p id="Par17" class="p">These results suggest that CESM’s PHYS dust module produces improved skill in capturing observed long-term changes in dust emissions, when forced by reanalysis meteorology, which provides some limited confidence in simulations of future changes in the global dust emission rate (see Methods for remaining important limitations on the model simulations). The future simulations forecast an increase in the global dust emission rate (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">4</xref>), which is driven by two factors. The first factor is a slight increase in wind speed over most North African dust source regions, which is within the range of CMIP5 simulation results (Fig.

 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>
 </sup>), although the mean of CMIP5 simulations predicts a slight decrease in dust emissions due to North African wind speed changes. The second factor is a decrease in soil moisture in almost all source regions

 </sup> (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">5</xref>), and particularly at the margins of the major African and Asian source regions. Furthermore, the enhanced sensitivity of the K14 dust emission parameterization to the soil state causes regions with substantial changes in soil moisture to show larger differences in the response of the dust flux between the old and the new parameterizations. Consequently, CESM with the PHYS emission module predicts an enhanced sensitivity of the dust cycle to future climate changes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). That is, we find that the increase in the global dust emission rate in response to climate changes almost doubles relative to the simulation with the BASE emission module, from +14 to +24% for a surface temperature change of ~3 K (corresponding to the period 2076–2100 relative to 1976–2000).
