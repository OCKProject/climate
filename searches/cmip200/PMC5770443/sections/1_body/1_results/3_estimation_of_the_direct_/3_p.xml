<p id="Par20" class="p">We combined these simulated values of 
 <italic class="italic">κ</italic> with constraints on the present–climate dust DRE (see Methods) in order to estimate the order of magnitude of the global direct dust–climate feedback 
 <italic class="italic">λ</italic>
 <sub class="sub">dust</sub> in Eq. (
 <xref rid="Equ4" ref-type="" class="xref">4</xref>). For the CMIP5 ensemble, the wide probability distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">κ</italic> yields a correspondingly wide distribution for the direct dust–climate feedback: 
 <italic class="italic">λ</italic>
 <sub class="sub">dust</sub> = −0.001 (−0.023 ±0.013) Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> K
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4a</xref>). CESM with the BASE dust module yields 
 <italic class="italic">λ</italic>
 <sub class="sub">dust</sub> = −0.007 (−0.023 to +0.009) Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>K
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, which is again consistent with the range suggested by the CMIP5 simulations. In contrast, using the more physically based K14 dust module enhances the dust cycle response to future climate change (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>), and thus yields a larger direct dust–climate feedback of −0.013 (−0.041 to +0.016) Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>K
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4a</xref>), which is partially outside of the range suggested by the CMIP5 simulations. These three estimates of the direct dust–climate feedback are themselves a sum of opposing feedbacks, due to changes in cooling interactions with SW radiation and warming interactions with LW radiation. We find that the feedback due to only SW cooling interactions is in the range of −0.06 to +0.02 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>K
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4b</xref>), whereas that due to counteracting LW warming is approximately half that at −0.01 to +0.03 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>K
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4c</xref>).
