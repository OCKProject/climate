<p id="Par42" class="p">We followed a similar procedure to calculate the annually averaged modeled dust AOD for each site. That is, we used the simulated AOD at the exact days for which measurements were available to first calculate the modeled monthly averaged AOD, which we then averaged for each of the 12 months to obtain the seasonal AOD cycle. We then subtracted this from each modeled monthly averaged AOD to obtain the AOD anomaly, which was then averaged over all months in a given year to obtain the modeled annually averaged AOD anomaly. We then obtained the modeled annually averaged AOD by adding this anomaly to the mean AOD obtained from averaging over the modeled seasonal AOD cycle. The resulting comparison between measured and modeled AOD is plotted in Supplementary FigureÂ
