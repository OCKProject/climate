<p id="Par39" class="p">We used the results of the two pairs of historical simulations to evaluate the ability of the new K14 dust emission scheme to reproduce past changes in dust emissions. We thus focused this evaluation on measurements close to dusty regions, in order to have confidence that observed and modeled changes are largely due to changes in dust emissions, and not due to changes in circulation patterns or depositional processes. As such, we compared the simulations against satellite-derived estimates of dust optical depth off the West African coast around Cape Verde

 </sup>. Since this record extends back to 1982, it allows us to test whether the model reproduces variability in dust emissions from the worldâ€™s main source region over the past several decades, when forced by winds from reanalysis meteorology.
