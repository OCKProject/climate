<p id="Par41" class="p">The above procedure resulted in the selection of eight AERONET stations with long-term trends driven by changes in dust: five in North Africa, one in the North Atlantic, and two in the Middle East. We processed the data at each of these stations to obtain the annually averaged AOD, and to remove the effects of changes in the exact days on which AOD was measured between years at a given site. First, we calculated the monthly averaged AOD for months with at least 5 days of data. For this, we used the daily averaged level 2.0 quality assured AOD (pre-field and post-field calibrated and manually inspected), obtained from the Version 2 Direct Sun Algorithm. We then used these monthly averages to calculate the seasonal AOD cycle at each station from the average of all available monthly averaged AOD values for each of the 12 months (see Supplementary Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>). We then subtracted this seasonal AOD cycle from each monthly averaged AOD to obtain the anomaly in the AOD for each month. To obtain the annually averaged AOD for each year, we then averaged this anomaly over all 12 months in a given year, and then added this annually averaged AOD anomaly to the mean AOD obtained from averaging over the seasonal cycle of AOD.
