 </sup> for which such long-term changes were dominated by changes in dust. That is, we selected AERONET stations that both have long data records, and for which we can be confident that long-term changes in AOD are due to changes in dust, as opposed to changes in other aerosols. We therefore selected stations with at least 5 years for which an annual mean AOD can be defined, subject to the further quality control criteria below. Since smaller values of the Angstrom exponent 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic> indicate coarser aerosols

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>
 </sup>, we use measurements of α in the 440–870 nm wavelength range to select stations for which long-term AOD changes are due to dust. This can be indicated either by (i) very low values of 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>, indicating that AOD is overwhelmingly due to dust, such that changes in AOD are very likely due to changes in dust, or (ii) by increases in AOD being associated with a coarsening of aerosols and thus a decrease in 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>. Correspondingly, we selected stations that either have a very low Angstrom exponent, 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic> &lt; 0.4, or for which the majority of the variance in dust AOD is explained by changes in the Angstrom exponent, as quantified by a correlation between 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic> and AOD of 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> &lt; −0.70. To exclude the possibility that changes in other coarse aerosols, notably sea salt, are driving changes in AOD, we further only use stations for which over 75% of the AOD is due to dust, based on the simulations reported in Kok et al.
