<p id="Par50" class="p">We list here the most important limitations of our methodology that have not already been discussed in the main text. First, the coarse resolution and incomplete description of the land surface handicaps climate models in simulating dust emissions. This occurs in large part because dust emission is a small-scale process that is sensitive to unresolved variations in both (turbulent) winds and in soil properties such as size distribution, mineralogy, soil moisture, and soil aggregation state
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" class="xref">67</xref>
 </sup>. Furthermore, dust emission can be triggered by mesoscale meteorological events that also are not captured well in many models
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" class="xref">68</xref>
 </sup>, such as haboobs and the breakdown of the nocturnal low level jet. These limitations restrict the ability of models to reproduce the dust cycle even in the current climate
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">20</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">21</xref>
 </sup>, and thus adds substantial uncertainty to simulations of the dust cycle in a future climate. Therefore, although we use an ensemble of climate models to constrain 
 <italic class="italic">κ</italic>, it is possible that climate models have systematic biases in simulating dust cycle response to climate changes, which cannot be quantified here. Second, the CMIP5 and CESM simulations do not account for changes in the dust emission rate due to changes in source regions, other than those already captured in its physically based scheme. That is, these simulations do not account for (i) changes in (fluvial) sediment supply and thus erodibility of existing source regions, and (ii) changes in biogeography, i.e., changes in biomes rather than changes in LAI within a biome, which CESM does account for. Third, the simulated response of the global dust cycle to climate changes is known to be highly sensitivity to both the treatment of the response of vegetation to changes in climate and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration, and to future changes in precipitation and surface temperature
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>
 </sup>. Whereas the ensemble of CMIP5 simulations captures a range of possibilities for both future changes in meteorology and vegetation response to changes in climate and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, the CESM future simulations do not. That is, these simulations were forced with atmospheric simulations that are close to the median of the CMIP3 climate model ensemble, and use only a single parameterization of vegetation response to climate and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">24</xref>
 </sup>. Fourth, the CMIP5 and CESM simulations, respectively, use the RCP8.5 and A1B scenarios, and we did not test the sensitivity of the direct dust–climate feedback to the emissions scenario. Nonetheless, because the direct dust–climate feedback is implicitly normalized by the surface temperature change, we expect differences in the direct dust–climate feedback between scenarios to be substantially less than they would be for model calculations of dust radiative forcing. Fifth, the constraint on the dust DRE is subject to a number of limitations. In addition to those already described in ref.
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>
 </sup>, recent measurements indicate that LW interactions might be less important than previously thought
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" class="xref">69</xref>
 </sup>, which could cause the dust DRE to be more cooling than represented in ref. 
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>
 </sup>. Conversely, the lifetime of coarse dust might be underestimated in ref. 
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>
 </sup>, which could have caused an underestimate of dust warming. In addition, the ensemble of simulations of the dust direct radiative effect used in Kok et al.
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>
 </sup> does not account for regional heterogeneity in the mineralogy of dust, which likely has a limited effect on the global DRE but does substantially affect the spatial pattern of the dust DRE
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70" class="xref">70</xref>
 </sup>. A final limitation of our methodology is that, although CESM with the improved dust emission scheme and driven by ERA-Interim meteorology shows some skill in reproducing past changes in dust emissions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>), the drivers of future changes in dust emissions are likely to differ from past ones. In particular, past changes in North African dust emissions seem to be due primarily to changes in wind speed over the Sahara
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>
 </sup>. However, future climate changes are expected to be due to several factors, including changes in wind speed
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>
 </sup>, changes in desert extent due to both increasing CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentrations
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>
 </sup> and likely decreases in soil moisture in semi-arid regions
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">35</xref>
 </sup>, and changes in erodibility of arid regions, such as due to the decreases in soil moisture. Furthermore, since the meteorology in the PHYS-AVHRR simulations is prescribed, it does not provide information on whether CESM can correctly simulate relevant changes in wind, soil moisture, and surface temperature in a future climate, which affect the resulting dust emission. Indeed, CMIP5 models have been shown to be incapable of reproducing important changes in North African dust in the current climate when forced by observed SSTs
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>
 </sup>, which casts substantial doubt on their ability to accurately forecast future changes in the dust cycle. The above limitations of our study suggest that our methodology underestimates the uncertainty of the direct dust–climate feedback, and thus should be seen as an order of magnitude estimate.
