<p id="Par34" class="p">In addition to wind speed and soil moisture, dust emissions are also affected by the presence of vegetation. The dust emission flux in CESM is parameterized to decrease linearly with the leaf area index (LAI), going to zero at a threshold LAI of 0.3

 </sup>. Future and historical simulations are driven with land cover that is representative of the year 2000. As such, although seasonal and climatic changes in LAI are prognostically modeled in CLM4-CN, this model does not account for possible changes in the biogeography due to changes in land use or climate. We chose this approach because historical changes in the West African dust plume (Fig.

 </sup>, and because estimating the dust climate feedback requires the isolation of the dust cycle’s response to changes in climate (see discussion in main text).
