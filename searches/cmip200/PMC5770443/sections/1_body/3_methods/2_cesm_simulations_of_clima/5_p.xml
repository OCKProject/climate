<p id="Par35" class="p">For both the BASE and the PHYS dust emission models, we ran two separate CESM simulations to evaluate the model’s ability to reproduce historical changes in dust emissions. The first pair of simulations, BASE-AVHRR and PHYS-AVHRR, model the global dust cycle over the historical period 1980–2008, with the objective of evaluating the model’s ability to reproduce the historical trend in aerosol optical depth (AOD) over the tropical North Atlantic ocean, derived from the long-term AOD record obtained by the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR)

 </sup>. The second pair of simulations, BASE-AERONET and PHYS-AERONET, model the global dust cycle over the historical period 1995–2011 with the objective of evaluating the model’s ability to reproduce long-term trends in AOD measurements by AERONET stations. The BASE-AERONET and PHYS-AERONET simulations have been described in detail in ref.
