<p id="Par37" class="p">The simulations used the capability of CESM to be forced with reanalysis winds instead of predicted winds. Specifically, the BASE-AVHRR and PHYS-AVHRR runs used the MERRA reanalysis meteorology from the Goddard Earth Observing System of the NASA Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (see

However, the use of the ERA-Interim reanalysis meteorology

 </sup>. Therefore, the BASE-AERONET and PHYS-AERONET simulations used the ERA-Interim reanalysis. However, instead using the MERRA reanalysis similarly yields a better agreement of the PHYS-AERONET simulation against the AERONET data than does the BASE-AERONET simulation.
