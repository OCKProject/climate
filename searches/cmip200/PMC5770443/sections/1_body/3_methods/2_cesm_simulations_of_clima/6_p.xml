<p id="Par36" class="p">In both pairs of simulations, the dust emissions calculated by CLM4-CN were used by CESM’s atmosphere model, the Community Atmosphere Model version 4 (CAM4), to calculate the three-dimensional transport and deposition of dust, as well as the dust aerosol optical depth

 </sup>. To do so, CAM4 distributes the emitted dust into four size bins between 0.1 and 10 μm diameter following a size distribution parameterization based on brittle fragmentation theory
