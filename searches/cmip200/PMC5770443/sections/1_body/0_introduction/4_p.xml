<p id="Par6" class="p">Here, we leverage these advances in order to estimate the direct dust–climate feedback. We do so by using a simple theoretical framework that combines constraints on the dust DRE
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>
 </sup> with model simulations of how that DRE is distributed regionally, and with a series of climate model results on the response of the change in global dust loading in response to future climate change. A subset of these simulations use both coupled carbon–nitrogen cycles

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">24</xref>

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">21</xref>
 </sup>. We find that the global direct dust–climate feedback is of the order of a percent of the total physical feedbacks in the climate system, and that it is approximately an order of magnitude larger close to source regions, where it could play an important role in shaping future climate.
