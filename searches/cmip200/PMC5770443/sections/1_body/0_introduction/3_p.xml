<p id="Par5" class="p">Although interactions between climate and the global dust cycle remain highly uncertain, recent advances now permit an order-of-magnitude estimation of the direct dustâ€“climate feedback. In particular, a physically based dust emission scheme can now reproduce the global dust cycle without the use of an empirical source function
