 <p id="Par1" class="p">Feedbacks between the global dust cycle and the climate system might have amplified past climate changes. Yet, it remains unclear what role the dust–climate feedback will play in future anthropogenic climate change. Here, we estimate the direct dust–climate feedback, arising from changes in the dust direct radiative effect (DRE), using a simple theoretical framework that combines constraints on the dust DRE with a series of climate model results. We find that the direct dust–climate feedback is likely in the range of −0.04 to +0.02 Wm

On a regional scale, the direct dust–climate feedback is enhanced by approximately an order of magnitude close to major source regions. This suggests that it could play an important role in shaping the future climates of Northern Africa, the Sahel, the Mediterranean region, the Middle East, and Central Asia.
