There were several floods events recorded in Chennai, a one of the major metropolitan coastal city in India. The flood incidences were repeatedly reported in recent decades. In this study, the existing state of storm water drains are evaluated under current and future climate scenarios in one of the most flood-prone areas of Chennai viz. Velachery zone. The mitigation measures are recommended to increase its resilience against floods. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) CMIP5 models of Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 4.5 are used to develop possible future climate change scenarios of the city. The daily rainfall data for the period 1975&#x02013;2015 obtained from India Meteorological Department are used to find the extremities and to generate Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) curves. The IDF curves are generated for 2, 5, 10, 50, 100 year return period under current and future climate scenarios. The storm drainage network are delineated with Differential Geographic Positioning System (DGPS) survey. The integrated hydraulic and hydrological modelling is carried out to assess the flood carrying capacity of storm drainage under present and future climate scenarios. The vulnerable hotspots are identified and flood mitigation measures are suggested to reduce the flood risk at Velachery.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Climate sciences</kwd><kwd>Environmental sciences</kwd><kwd>Hydrology</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>State Planning Commission, Government of Tamil Nadu</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Nearly 54% of world&#x02019;s population lives in urban areas and it is expected to increase up to 66% by 2050 and most of these urban areas are coastal cities. The 2014 revision of the World Urbanization Prospects by UN DESA&#x02019;s Population Division says that the huge rate of urban growth will take place especially in India, China and Nigeria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. While, these urban systems are most critical structures in modern societies under changing climate scenarios, have disruptions and significant effects on the daily life of urban inhabitants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. As per the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Assessment Report 5, the number of heavy precipitation events has increased on land regions. In the Asian region, strong variability is observed in precipitation trends and extremes in different parts and seasons of Asia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. This changes in climate will disproportionately affect cities mostly located in climate-sensitive areas such as floodplains and coastal zones. The most important effects of climate change on cities are likely to be on water availability, flooding (pluvial, fluvial and coastal) from heavy precipitation, increased surface and stream erosion and overloading of storm water treatment systems during high flow events. In typical urban storm water networks, vulnerabilities such as flooding arise as the capacity of components within the system is overloaded and runoff accumulates at the surface. Studies to date indicate that the response of drainage systems to projected climate changes is site dependent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. These conditions have implications for site-specific storm water and floodplain management as local decision makers look to improve existing infrastructure and build new storm water systems. There is an increased attention on urban storm water management and flood mitigation in vulnerable regions especially in developing countries such as India. The recent climate impact assessment studies provide insights into how climate change information can be incorporated into local planning and decision making through an integrated approach for sustainable urban water management<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Recent extreme rainfall events resulting in flooding across many of the Indian cities have forced governments to initiate actions towards the impact of climate change on local conditions and adaptation/mitigation actions that can fit into decision-making processes. Being a coastal city, Chennai faces flood threats often both through cyclonic activities and monsoon rains. In the past, several flood events were recorded at Chennai and the flood incidences were repeatedly reported in the recent decades during 2002, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2010, 2015 and 2016. Chennai was severely flooded due to heavy rains (16&#x02013;20&#x02009;cm) during October 30 to November 2, 2002. Residential areas became &#x02018;islands&#x02019; and were cut-off, causing disruption in services and trade, including transport, communication, etc. A deep depression over the Bay of Bengal brought about 42&#x02009;cm rainfall within a 40&#x02009;h duration during the North-East monsoon of 2005<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. During the flood in 2008 which was of moderate intensity, residential areas near Taramani link road got submerged in rain water. During November and December 2015 Chennai witnessed heavy rainfall incidence that took away many lives and caused water logging in many parts of the city. The severity of flood was extreme and the financial cost of the flood was unprecedented. The entire commercial, trading, transport (both land and air) and industrial activity stopped for several days. These extreme events stress the need for flood assessment in Chennai under future climate change scenarios. In 2016, cyclone &#x02018;Vardah&#x02019; brings heavy rainfall in Chennai and many area were inundated.</p><p id="Par4">Recent heavy flooding events in Chennai have prompted to have a relook into existing state of storm water drains stresses the need for flood management studies under present and future climate scenarios. The study area Velachery in Chennai Metropolitan Area is frequently affected by flood resulting in water stagnation. The present study addresses the impacts of climate change on storm water management at Velachery &#x02013; a flood-prone area of Chennai. Velachery, a rapidly growing zone of southern Chennai Metropolitan Area lies between Latitudes 12&#x000b0;58&#x02032;20&#x02033;N and 12&#x000b0;58&#x02032;33&#x02033;N and Longitudes 80&#x000b0;13&#x02032;35&#x02033;E and 80&#x000b0;13&#x02032;17&#x02033;E. The boom in Information Technology during the last decade has accelerated the growth of Velachery into a commercial and residential hub. Rapid urbanization is continuously encroaching on the drainage system of Velachery. This area is known for frequent inundation, resulting from storm water stagnation and choking of storm drain network. The storm water from Velachery passes through the Pallikaranai marshland and reaches Okkiyam Maduvu channel. Storm water from Okkiyam Maduvu then passes through Buckingham Canal and reaches the sea at Muttukadu, Kovalam. Okkiyam Maduvu is a 2.8 kilometres long water channel originates as a narrow canal from the Pallikaranai marshland and drains into the Buckingham canal which flows south and enters the Kovalam estuary. The location of the study area is shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. Thus, this work is carried out to evaluate the storm water drain performance under climate change scenarios and to identify the vulnerable hot spots in Velachery Zone &#x00026; propose mitigation measure for free flow of the storm water. The scientific knowledge of the study will help city planners to design intelligent climate-proof urban storm water drainage design.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Location map of the study area.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2019_43859_Fig1_HTML" id="d29e295"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Observed rainfall extreme events and projected future climate scenario</title><p id="Par5">The rainfall extremities are one of the major concerns of changing the climate. The occurrences of extreme events in the study area were calculated based on Indian Meteorological Department norms. The extremely heavy rainfall event (&#x0003e;244.5&#x02009;mm/day) and very heavy rainfall event (&#x0003e;124.5&#x02009;mm/day) for the period of 1975&#x02013;2015 were calculated. The results show that the occurrence of the extremely heavy rainfall events and very heavy rainfall events are increasing in recent years. Out of 46 occurrences of very rainfall events, 15 events recorded within the period 2000&#x02013;2015. Eight extreme heavy rainfall events occurred during 1975&#x02013;2015. In 1976 extremely heavy rainfall event was recorded with the intensity of 346.6&#x02009;mm/day and 345.1 mm/day was recorded in 2015.

IDF curves were developed for 5 different durations (1&#x02009;h, 2&#x02009;h, 6&#x02009;h, 12&#x02009;h and 24&#x02009;h) with 5 return periods of 2, 5, 10, 50, 100 years for observed and projceted climate scenario. Therefore, 25 annual maximum time series were used for the frequency analysis to develop the IDF curves. The result shows that the intensity of rainfall for 2 year return period is 33.57&#x02009;mm/hr under observed climate. Similarly, for 10 year return period, the intensity is 57.89&#x02009;mm/hr and 88.22&#x02009;mm/hr intensity is estimated for 100 year return period rainfall.

The total watershed area is 697.1&#x02009;ha and further delineated to 121 smaller sub-catchments. The parameter details like area, width, imperviousness rate and average slope were derived from these sub-catchments. Nearly 88.5% area is impervious and the elevation ranges from 1.87&#x02009;m to 13.2&#x02009;m. Performance of the storm drain in the study area was analyzed by simulating the model for rainfall of 5 different return periods as (2&#x02009;yr, 5&#x02009;yr, 10&#x02009;yr, 50&#x02009;yr and 100&#x02009;yr). Likewise, the model was used to simulate for future projected rainfall data. All the inputs except design storm were same for all the simulations. The simulation results on rainfall, infiltration, runoff and inflow/outflow for the conveyance system show that most of the rainfall in the study area is converted into a surface runoff. For 2&#x02009;yr return period the simulated runoff is 32.402&#x02009;mm for a given rainfall of 33.567&#x02009;mm. Infiltration loss is only 0.455&#x02009;mm due to the imperviousness of the study area. Similarly from 88.223&#x02009;mm rainfall, 87.292&#x02009;mm is converted into a surface runoff for 100&#x02009;yr return period. Final surface storage is ranged from 0.847 to 0.894&#x02009;mm for 2 to 100&#x02009;yr return period. The result shows that infiltration is very less due to high imperviousness of the study area. Surface storage also very less due to flat terrain. Most of the rainfall results into surface runoff because the capacity of the storm drains is inadequate for intense rainfall and flooding takes place.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Storm drainage network of study area.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2019_43859_Fig4_HTML" id="d29e349"/></fig></p><p id="Par8">Outfall 1 is the major outlet.

Out of 4 outfalls, outfall 1, 2 and 4 joins with the Pallikaranai marshland and outfall 3 is connected with Buckingham canal. The maximum flooding occurred at junction VB-179 which was located in 100&#x02009;ft road very near to Velachery lake and the flow rate was 36.554&#x02009;m<sup>3</sup>/s. Nearly 15 nodes were flooded for many hours for even a 2 year return period rainfall. There was little inflow in 48 nodes due to the elevation change.

A number of nodes flooded for different return periods of observed climate were compared with GCMs models results. The number of nodes flooded are increased with the increase in return period. Nearly 23 nodes were flooded for about 5&#x02009;hours for a 2 year return period and nearly 50 nodes were flooded for the 100 year return period. Some of the nodes idenfied flooding nearly 1&#x02009;day for all the return period under observed and projected climate scenarios. These vulnerable nodes were located near Taramani link road connecting with Velachery main road towards Tambaram.

Comparison between observed and projected IDF curves under changing climate scenario shows that there is an increase of 12% intensity for 2 year return period rainfall and 87% increase for 100 year return period. The assessment of Velachery drainage system response to storm events of various return periods under present and future climate change scenarios idendifies the vulnerable hot-spots including critically flooded channels and outflows. The highest peak discharge is observed in Outfall 1 which is located near to Velachery lake and joins with Pallikarani marshland. Maximum flooding is noticed at junction VB-179 which is located very near to Velachery Lake. Out of 234 nodes/junctions, 9 nodes are identified as hotspots and flooding noticed under all storm events. These nodes are inundated for nearly 24 hours. Proper maintenance should be taken routinely inorder to make a free way to drain out the flow and to avoid the blockages in storm drains. It will help to reduce the detention period. Construction of the new road should not obstruct the passage or the inlet of the storm drains. Storm drains constructed in some places should be redesigned to cope with future flood events. Increasing size of the Okkiam Maduvu weir width from 120&#x02009;m to 200&#x02009;m, will reduce the depth of the flow over the weir from 3.43&#x02009;m to 2.44&#x02009;m for 100&#x02009;yr return period rainfall thus reducing the backwater effect. At Okkiam Maduvu, minimum width of 200&#x02009;m in the downstream channel is essential to ensure the free flow of flood water. The carrying capacity of the channel may be improved by removing vegetation and blockages and lining with stone pitching.</p><p id="Par15">This study provides a holistic approach to study flood management through integrating the climate knowledge with the flood frequency of Chennai. The present study undertakes a hybrid approach by combining climate scenarios with urban storm drainage network to address the pluvial flooding problem of the study area. There is a good agreement with the data analyzed on climate extremities and frequency of urban flooding. The successful incorporation of the scientifically reliable climate information in hydrologic and hydraulic models demonstrates the versatility of this technique for site specific flood management studies. Moreover, in this study, hydrologic and hydraulic modelling are well supported with strong field data and actual flow measurements. This work uses high resolution DEM (10&#x02009;m resolution) procured from National Remote Sensing Center. However it is desirable to have fine resolution DEM preferably with sub meter accuracy which can be opted better results. Besides, incorporating real time flood forecasting with Low Impact Development (LID) practices such as permeable pavements, rain gardens, green roofs, street planters, rain barrels, infiltration trenches and vegetative swales in Hydrologic modelling in future studies will provide more accurate and effective flood management system.</p><sec id="Sec8"><title>Methodology</title><p id="Par16">The critical rainfall events and different physical characteristics are used to describe the response of Velachery drainage system.

The recent IPCC AR5 adopted Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) to illustrate the concentration of future anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions via., RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 6.0 and RCP 8.5. RCP 2.6 is peak scenario and represents very low greenhouse gas concentration levels. RCP 4.5 is balanced mitigation scenario or stabilization scenario where total radiative forcing is stabilized before the year 2100 by the employment of a range of technologies and strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. RCP 6.0 is stabilization scenario where total radiative forcing is stabilized before 2100 without overshoot employment of a range of technologies and strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
