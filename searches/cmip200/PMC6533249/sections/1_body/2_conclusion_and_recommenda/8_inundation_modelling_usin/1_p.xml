<p id="Par23" class="p">Several mathematical models are widely used to model the dynamics of rainfall-runoff and flood generation processes such as MIKE URBAN, HEC-HMS, SWMM, DRAINS, MOUSE, Infowork RS, HSPF, DR3M, STORM etc

 </sup>. These urban storm water flow models may prove to be immensely beneficial in ascertaining the effects of various storm water management strategies and evaluating the storm readiness and climate resilience of the cities. Storm Water Management Model (SWMM), developed by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), is a comprehensive computer model for simulating hydrological and hydraulic processes of an urban watershed

 </sup>. The surface runoff in a sub-catchment is routed fully to enter the junction and transported through the storm sewer conduits to the area outlet, so there is only pipeline runoff flow and no surface runoff routing is considered. The model has been used for various urban catchments in India particularly for a single watershed under uncalibrated condition
