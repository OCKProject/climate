 </sup>. The hydrological processes were set up with creating parameters such as rain gauge, sub-catchment, node, link and outfall. The sub-catchment delineation was done with ArcSWAT tool in ArcGIS using CartoDEM of 10 m resolution with the help of a base map prepared. The storm water drainage network was created by including the junction nodes and the conduits. Each sub-catchment was joined with corresponding nodes. The design parameters of the junctions include junction ID, invert level and diameter. The design parameters of the conduit include conduit ID, shape, inlet node, outlet node, length, maximum depth, roughness, and flow through pipe and loss coefficient. The nodes were linked by conduits and in a total of 238 nodes and 4 outfalls and 240 links were created. Links represent the channel and nodes indicate junction or change in direction (Fig.
