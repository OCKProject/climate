<p id="Par25" class="p">The details of the drains such as size and length were collected from Corporation of Chennai Zonal office, Adyar. Pervious and impervious areas were digitized with Google Earth, then percentage imperviousness was calculated. Nearly 88.5% area is impervious. Normally the storm drains are rectangular concrete channels with rough forms, so the Manning’s roughness coefficient (n) was taken to be 0.015. Green-Ampt infiltration method was selected with suction head 8.27 mm, conductivity 0.04 mm/hr and an initial deficit of 0.2 mm/hr. Dynamic Wave Routing method was adopted to solve the Saint-Venant flow equations.</p>
