<p id="Par15" class="p">This study provides a holistic approach to study flood management through integrating the climate knowledge with the flood frequency of Chennai. The present study undertakes a hybrid approach by combining climate scenarios with urban storm drainage network to address the pluvial flooding problem of the study area. There is a good agreement with the data analyzed on climate extremities and frequency of urban flooding. The successful incorporation of the scientifically reliable climate information in hydrologic and hydraulic models demonstrates the versatility of this technique for site specific flood management studies. Moreover, in this study, hydrologic and hydraulic modelling are well supported with strong field data and actual flow measurements. This work uses high resolution DEM (10â€‰m resolution) procured from National Remote Sensing Center. However it is desirable to have fine resolution DEM preferably with sub meter accuracy which can be opted better results. Besides, incorporating real time flood forecasting with Low Impact Development (LID) practices such as permeable pavements, rain gardens, green roofs, street planters, rain barrels, infiltration trenches and vegetative swales in Hydrologic modelling in future studies will provide more accurate and effective flood management system.</p>
