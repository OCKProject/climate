<p id="Par4" class="p">Recent heavy flooding events in Chennai have prompted to have a relook into existing state of storm water drains stresses the need for flood management studies under present and future climate scenarios. The study area Velachery in Chennai Metropolitan Area is frequently affected by flood resulting in water stagnation. The present study addresses the impacts of climate change on storm water management at Velachery – a flood-prone area of Chennai. Velachery, a rapidly growing zone of southern Chennai Metropolitan Area lies between Latitudes 12°58′20″N and 12°58′33″N and Longitudes 80°13′35″E and 80°13′17″E. The boom in Information Technology during the last decade has accelerated the growth of Velachery into a commercial and residential hub. Rapid urbanization is continuously encroaching on the drainage system of Velachery. This area is known for frequent inundation, resulting from storm water stagnation and choking of storm drain network. The storm water from Velachery passes through the Pallikaranai marshland and reaches Okkiyam Maduvu channel. Storm water from Okkiyam Maduvu then passes through Buckingham Canal and reaches the sea at Muttukadu, Kovalam. Okkiyam Maduvu is a 2.8 kilometres long water channel originates as a narrow canal from the Pallikaranai marshland and drains into the Buckingham canal which flows south and enters the Kovalam estuary. The location of the study area is shown in Fig.

Thus, this work is carried out to evaluate the storm water drain performance under climate change scenarios and to identify the vulnerable hot spots in Velachery Zone &amp; propose mitigation measure for free flow of the storm water. The scientific knowledge of the study will help city planners to design intelligent climate-proof urban storm water drainage design.
