<p id="Par2" class="p">Nearly 54% of world’s population lives in urban areas and it is expected to increase up to 66% by 2050 and most of these urban areas are coastal cities. The 2014 revision of the World Urbanization Prospects by UN DESA’s Population Division says that the huge rate of urban growth will take place especially in India, China and Nigeria

 </sup>. As per the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Assessment Report 5, the number of heavy precipitation events has increased on land regions. In the Asian region, strong variability is observed in precipitation trends and extremes in different parts and seasons of Asia

 </sup>. This changes in climate will disproportionately affect cities mostly located in climate-sensitive areas such as floodplains and coastal zones. The most important effects of climate change on cities are likely to be on water availability, flooding (pluvial, fluvial and coastal) from heavy precipitation, increased surface and stream erosion and overloading of storm water treatment systems during high flow events. In typical urban storm water networks, vulnerabilities such as flooding arise as the capacity of components within the system is overloaded and runoff accumulates at the surface. Studies to date indicate that the response of drainage systems to projected climate changes is site dependent

 </sup>. These conditions have implications for site-specific storm water and floodplain management as local decision makers look to improve existing infrastructure and build new storm water systems. There is an increased attention on urban storm water management and flood mitigation in vulnerable regions especially in developing countries such as India. The recent climate impact assessment studies provide insights into how climate change information can be incorporated into local planning and decision making through an integrated approach for sustainable urban water management
