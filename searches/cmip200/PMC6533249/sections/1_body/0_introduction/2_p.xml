<p id="Par3" class="p">Recent extreme rainfall events resulting in flooding across many of the Indian cities have forced governments to initiate actions towards the impact of climate change on local conditions and adaptation/mitigation actions that can fit into decision-making processes. Being a coastal city, Chennai faces flood threats often both through cyclonic activities and monsoon rains. In the past, several flood events were recorded at Chennai and the flood incidences were repeatedly reported in the recent decades during 2002, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2010, 2015 and 2016. Chennai was severely flooded due to heavy rains (16–20 cm) during October 30 to November 2, 2002. Residential areas became ‘islands’ and were cut-off, causing disruption in services and trade, including transport, communication, etc. A deep depression over the Bay of Bengal brought about 42 cm rainfall within a 40 h duration during the North-East monsoon of 2005

 </sup>. During the flood in 2008 which was of moderate intensity, residential areas near Taramani link road got submerged in rain water. During November and December 2015 Chennai witnessed heavy rainfall incidence that took away many lives and caused water logging in many parts of the city. The severity of flood was extreme and the financial cost of the flood was unprecedented. The entire commercial, trading, transport (both land and air) and industrial activity stopped for several days. These extreme events stress the need for flood assessment in Chennai under future climate change scenarios. In 2016, cyclone ‘Vardah’ brings heavy rainfall in Chennai and many area were inundated.
