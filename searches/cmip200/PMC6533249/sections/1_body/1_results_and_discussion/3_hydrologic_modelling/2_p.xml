<p id="Par8" class="p">Outfall 1 is the major outlet. This outlet is located near Velacherry railway station and joins with Pallikaranai marshland. Most of the storm drains in the study area are connected to outfall 1. (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). The model predicts a total peak discharge as 13.918 m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>/sec for 2 year return period rainfall and 52% of the total peak discharge is from outfall 1 as 7.29 m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>/sec. Total peak discharge is recorded as 21.9 m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>/sec for 100 year return period rainfall at outfall 1 which is 64% in total peak discharge from the study area. Out of 4 outfalls, outfall 1, 2 and 4 joins with the Pallikaranai marshland and outfall 3 is connected with Buckingham canal. The maximum flooding occurred at junction VB-179 which was located in 100 ft road very near to Velachery lake and the flow rate was 36.554 m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>/s. Nearly 15 nodes were flooded for many hours for even a 2 year return period rainfall. There was little inflow in 48 nodes due to the elevation change. It shows that the existing storm drains are poorly designed and constructed. Reconstruction of the drains according to the flow routing of that area will reduce the flood risk and will minimize the flooding duration.
