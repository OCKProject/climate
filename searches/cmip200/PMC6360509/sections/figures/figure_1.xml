  <p class="p">(a) Difference in leaf area index (LAI) of crops and natural vegetation in the simulations for September as a representative example, (b) total annual irrigation requirements, and (c) seasonal cycle of irrigation and LAI in the nine SREX regions. Note: The scales of irrigation requirements in panel (c) vary by region to account for the substantial regional differences in magnitude. Further, the regional average LAI in West Asia, Central Asia, and Tibet are small due to the relatively large fraction of bare soil in these regions. LAI = leaf area index; SREX = Special report on Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation.</p>
