<p class="p">Land cover change‐only experiments leverage the global distribution of general crop and pasture coverage developed by Pongratz et al. (

 <xref rid="jgrd55039-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). These data sets contain crop and pasture cover for every 50 years from 800 to 1850, for each decade between 1850 and 1985, and then annually for 1986 to present. We run our experiments using the crop coverage for the year 2000 only (i.e., not time varying). To accommodate crop cover, natural vegetation and bare soil cover are rescaled proportionally with the crop PFT such that all cover fractions sum to 1 in a grid box. Modern agricultural LAIs were represented by merging a global map of maize, rice, wheat, and soy distributions (Monfreda et al., 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>) with crop‐specific maximum LAI from the MODIS‐derived LAI3g product (Zhu et al., 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-bib-0095" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). This approach quantifies these crops' maximum LAI at a fine spatial resolution, accounting for areas where multiple crops may be grown within a single grid box, and then scales up their merged behavior into one crop cover type at the ModelE grid box scale. Only grid cells that were mostly cropped (&gt;80%) were included. In many regions, crop cover replaces a large proportion of the natural vegetation. For example, across western and southern Asia (which comprise one of our focus domains described below), approximately 50% of total land was converted to cropland, constituting a substantial regional forcing (supporting information Figure
