<p class="p">For simulations also evaluating the impact of agricultural land management, we focus specifically on modern irrigation and both its extent and intensity (Figure 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>b). We use prescribed global irrigation rates in ModelE2, which is implemented as detailed in Puma and Cook (
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-bib-0066" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). In summary, these rates were calculated offline using a water balance model approach that considers interactions between human water use (e.g., agriculture, industry, and households) and terrestrial water fluxes and, in particular, is responsive to crop and agricultural water demands (Wada et al., 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-bib-0087" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). This dynamic modeling approach is combined with empirical data sets of irrigation‐equipped areas and provides estimates of historical irrigation amounts. Calculations of irrigation rates from the offline model avoids unrealistic amounts that might otherwise arise from calculations within the GCM due to ModelE2 biases in simulating climate variables, particularly precipitation. Further, its finer resolution enables a more accurate representation of crops and, therefore, their water requirements. To be consistent with the above described crop coverage, we use irrigation amounts prescribed for the year 2000, assigning monthly values from Wada et al. (
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-bib-0087" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) to the middle of each month and linearly interpolating to the daily level. Irrigation amounts are applied to the entire vegetated portion of the grid cell, as the model does not have distinct soil columns for natural vegetation and crops, which may lead to overestimates in the spatial extent of applied irrigation water within some grid cells (although the total volume of applied irrigation is consistent with Wada et al., 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-bib-0087" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). We also note that the gross irrigation estimates are used rather than the estimates of the irrigation water used by the crops (i.e., net irrigation), so that the runoff, infiltration, and water uptake physics of ModelE2 can determine how much irrigation water is transpired by vegetation.
