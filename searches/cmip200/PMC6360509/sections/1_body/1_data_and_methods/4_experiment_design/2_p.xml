<p class="p">To compare the effects of agricultural land cover and land management, we conduct three 70‐year, constant‐forcing simulations with the GISS ModelE2, using preindustrial radiative forcings and prescribed climatological (1876–1885) sea surface temperatures from the Hadley Centre Global Sea Ice and Sea Surface Temperature dataset (Rayner et al., 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-bib-0072" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>). These simulations, differing only in their surface cover and excluding any other external climate forcings, are designed to isolate the seasonal climate responses to different land surface scenarios while accounting for natural atmospheric variability rather than to explain historical changes. The first simulation includes only natural vegetation cover, which we use as the baseline for comparison of land surface changes (referred to as NatVeg). The second simulation, representing agricultural expansion, is run with static modern‐day crop cover (Figure 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref>) based on year 2000 estimates in order to evaluate the impacts of land cover change alone (referred to as Crops). In the third simulation, representing one form of agricultural intensification, we include static, year 2000 irrigation rates in addition to year 2000 crop cover to evaluate the combined impacts of applying irrigation to agricultural areas (referred to as IrrigatedCrops). While these simulations are aimed at isolating the response of agriculture‐driven land cover change and irrigation, irrigation only occurs over cropped areas and therefore is not an orthogonal climate forcing to land cover change. The seasonal cycle of natural vegetation, crop cover, and irrigation is included in these simulations. To account for model spin‐up time, we only use the last 50 years of the simulations for the analysis.
