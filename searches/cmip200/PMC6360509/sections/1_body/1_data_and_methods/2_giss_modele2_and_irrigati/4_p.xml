<p class="p">To represent the LAIs for natural vegetation cover only, ModelE2 utilizes a monthly prescribed value and annual maximum taken from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS; MCD12Q1 V005 L3) International Geosphere‐Biosphere Program land cover types for the year 2004 (Friedl et al., 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). All crop cover classes, defined as a managed C3 grasses PFT, were set to 
 <italic class="italic">0</italic> fractional coverage such that the regionally prevailing land cover classes occupied the entirety of the grid box. The MODIS LAI is assigned by the land cover fraction of the grid box, taking the LAI value assigned to particular PFT and multiplying that by the fractional coverage for the same PFT. The sum of the fractional land cover per grid box is always 1, while the sum across the PFTs' LAIs is equal to the maximum LAI. Within the model simulations, the 2004 MODIS monthly prescribed LAI are linearly interpolated to create a daily time series.
