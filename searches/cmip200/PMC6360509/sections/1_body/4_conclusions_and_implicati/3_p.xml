<p class="p">Our study highlights the importance of land management decisions on regional climate relative to land cover change alone and has implications for better planning and management. Furthermore, it is becoming increasingly clear that such human activities have played a role in shaping historical climate changes. Most detection and attribution studies—including the new Detection and Attribution Model Intercomparison Project‐CMIP6 (Gillett et al., 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>)—and historical simulations do not consider the role of land management when simulating historical anthropogenic forcings. The substantial magnitude of climatic impacts in heavily irrigated areas suggests that these experiments are potentially missing a substantial historical climate forcing in certain regions that could lead to biases in simulating historical climate change and incomplete attribution of historical changes to anthropogenic activities. We argue that the individual effects of irrigation forcing should be considered in addition to land use forcing, as they have distinct controls. Especially when land cover and land management decisions are being considered based on their potential for climate change mitigation (Hirsch et al.,

 <xref rid="jgrd55039-bib-0090" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>), there is an urgent need to better understand their individual influences on regional climate processes in the past and future, which also requires a better understanding of their interaction with other anthropogenic forcings.
