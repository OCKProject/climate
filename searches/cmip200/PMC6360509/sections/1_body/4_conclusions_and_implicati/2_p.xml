<p class="p">We highlight four main conclusions from our study of nine regions with heavy irrigation and extensive agricultural land conversion. First, the effects of irrigation on surface temperature and precipitation are comparable to or larger in magnitude than the effects of land cover changes. Second, over some regions, irrigation amplifies the effects of land cover changes (such as for precipitation over parts of the MED and WAS) but in other regions it either dampens or reverses them (e.g., temperature and precipitation changes over parts of SAS). Third, irrigation impacts are not restricted to the primary growing season or peak irrigation season and can vary by season. Fourth, the impact of these forcings and their amplifying and contrasting effects extends into the troposphere and to remote regions. Changes in the vertical distribution of moisture and in‐cloud cover in response to these forcings influence temperatures at the lower atmospheric levels and throughout the troposphere in some regions. These changes in the tropospheric temperatures and low‐level moisture availability influence atmospheric circulation patterns. Consequently, through changing atmospheric circulations, irrigation and land cover change can affect climate in remote regions.</p>
