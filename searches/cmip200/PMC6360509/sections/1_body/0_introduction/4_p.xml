<p class="p">In addition to land cover impacts, land management (especially irrigation) is increasingly being recognized as a significant regional and global climate forcing in the 20th and early 21st centuries (Cook et al.,

During the twentieth century, irrigation rates have increased across many regions associated with agricultural intensification. This increase has been particularly rapid since the 1950s with the extraction of groundwater resources (Freydank &amp; Siebert, 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>; Wada et al., 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-bib-0086" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). Along with India, Pakistan, China, and North America, which account for over 55% of the global area equipped for irrigation, several Middle Eastern countries also had reportedly high fractions of their croplands with irrigation capabilities, based on a 2003 assessment (Freydank &amp; Siebert, 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). The surface temperature impacts of irrigated areas have been examined in observations and models, and the magnitude of the impacts is found to be comparable to the impacts of land cover changes alone in some regions (e.g., Luyssaert et al., 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>; Sacks et al., 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-bib-0075" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). Despite the significance of both land cover change and irrigation as distinct external climate forcings, only a few studies have attempted to disentangle the individual effects of these external climate forcings over the historical period and existing studies are largely limited to South Asia (Douglas et al.,
