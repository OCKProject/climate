<p class="p">Second, several studies have used regional climate models to investigate the effects of irrigation (e.g., Diffenbaugh, 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>; Douglas et al., 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>, 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>; Im et al., 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>; Paul et al., 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>; Saeed et al., 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-bib-0076" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>; Yang et al., 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-bib-0092" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). While regional models have the advantage of better simulating fine‐scale processes, they do not permit a physically consistent comparison across regions. Further, typical one‐way nested regional climate modeling efforts do not simulate the potential remote effects of regional land surface changes outside the simulation domain and two‐way coupling is relatively rare due to its technical challenges and heavy computational requirements (Giorgi &amp; Gutowski, 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Compounding this limitation, irrigation as a historical forcing is not included in the most recent archive of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5; Taylor et al., 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-bib-0081" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>) despite its substantial and varying regional climatic effects (Cook et al., 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>; Pielke et al., 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>) and is still not included in many global Earth system models (Cook et al., 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>; McDermid et al., 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). Global climate model ensembles such as the Land‐Use and Climate, Identification of Robust Impacts (LUCID) project (Pitman et al., 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-bib-0064" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>) and LUCID‐CMIP5 are mainly targeted at understanding the effects of land cover changes. Despite trade‐offs in terms of spatial resolution, global climate simulations facilitate a comparison of the effects of forcings across regions in a physically consistent framework.
