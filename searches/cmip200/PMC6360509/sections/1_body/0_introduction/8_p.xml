<p class="p">With the goal of examining the independent and compound influence of these land surface forcings, we perform novel experiments with the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) atmosphere‐only global climate model (GCM) Model E2 (Schmidt et al., 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-bib-0077" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) to study their effects on climate processes across regions with high agricultural intensity. Our study aims to (1) disentangle the climatic influences of land management in the form of irrigation from land cover changes, (2) identify which seasons have the strongest similarities and contrasts in climate response to these forcings, and (3) investigate the physical mechanisms associated with their differential impacts. By demonstrating the impacts of irrigation as comparable to those of land cover‐induced changes, our study highlights the importance of considering irrigation forcing in addition to land cover change to capture the complete influence of land surface changes on historical climate. Although land use and land cover change is a standard historical forcing in the CMIP5 (Taylor et al., 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-bib-0081" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>) and CMIP6 (Eyring et al., 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>), irrigation is still not included despite its increasing recognition as a global climate forcing. However, its inclusion in the Land Use Model Intercomparison Project‐CMIP6 will facilitate a comparison and a mechanistic understanding of the relative effects of land cover and irrigation on regional climate and inform more meaningful comparisons of their effects across models. With the continued intensification of agriculture (Foley et al.,
