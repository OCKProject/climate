<p class="p">While changes in surface energy balance and partitioning of surface fluxes are relevant for understanding the first‐order effects on local climate, changes in the atmospheric dynamics and thermodynamics are also important in shaping local and remote climate impacts (Figures

 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0008" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref>). This is evidenced from the substantial changes in tropospheric temperature and circulation in response to land cover change and irrigation. The temperature effects of both land surface forcings are not restricted to the surface. We find significant changes extending to the lower (850 hPa) and upper tropospheric (300 hPa) levels in all three seasons (Figures 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref> and 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0008" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref>). Overall, the effects of irrigation relative to land cover changes on lower tropospheric temperatures are consistent with the surface temperature effects (Figures 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>d–
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>f). However, the relative effects of irrigation on upper tropospheric temperatures are more variable. There is evidence of remote impacts, and in some regions, irrigation‐induced upper‐level atmospheric changes contrast those at the surface (Figure 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0008" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref>). For instance, cooling of similar magnitude to the surface occurs in the lower troposphere over the heavily irrigated parts of SAS in all three seasons. Most prominently in the summer, the effects of irrigation also extend into the upper troposphere with widespread cooling (&gt;1 °C) over CAS, WAS, and parts of the MED (Figures 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0008" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref>c and 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0008" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref>d). However, these temperature effects vary by season. For instance, relative to land cover forced changes, springtime irrigation causes upper tropospheric warming over SAS of a small but significant amount (0.2–0.4 °C) and cooling of a similar magnitude over much of the high latitudes. Such changes in tropospheric temperatures influence the horizontal and vertical temperature gradients that affect atmospheric stability and circulation patterns and in turn affect the processes that control the distribution of precipitation and other climate parameters (e.g., Adam et al.,
