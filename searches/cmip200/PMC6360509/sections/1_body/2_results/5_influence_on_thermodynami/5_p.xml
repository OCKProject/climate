<p class="p">Further, while the large‐scale circulation changes influence regional moisture convergence, other factors can influence convective activity and, therefore, precipitation responses to forcings (Figure

 <xref rid="jgrd55039-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>). We examine changes in moist static energy (MSE), a quantity closely associated with precipitation, particularly in the tropics and over monsoon regions. Associated with surface warming and enhanced moisture availability, land cover changes enhance MSE across much of SAS and WAS, particularly in the summer and fall. Irrigation amplifies MSE over WAS with the most widespread changes in the summer, which contribute to the enhancement of rainfall during the primary growing season (Figure 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0010" ref-type="fig" class="xref">10</xref>j). However, irrigation causes strong relative declines in MSE over parts of SAS due to the opposite temperature and moisture effects during all three seasons that are sufficiently strong to reverse the land‐induced MSE changes, except over the northwestern parts where it acts in concert with land cover‐induced changes. These regions are coincident with the regions of contrasting and amplifying precipitation responses to these forcings over SAS (Figures
