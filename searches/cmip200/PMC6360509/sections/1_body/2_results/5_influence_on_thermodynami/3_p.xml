<p class="p">We also find notable impacts of crop cover and irrigation on the regional circulation, with the most prominent differences over Asia (Figure 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0009" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9</xref>). Irrigation and land cover changes have opposing effects on the circulation and moisture convergence over SAS in all three seasons, consistent with their opposing influences on precipitation (Figures 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0009" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9</xref>). Low‐level (850 hPa) moisture convergence is closely associated with seasonal rainfall over these regions. Land cover changes enhance the South Asian summer monsoon circulation and cause an increase in moisture convergence during summer and fall, consistent with the increased rainfall in those seasons (Figures 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0009" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9</xref>a–
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0009" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9</xref>c). In contrast, irrigation leads to widespread divergence and anomalous easterly flow in these seasons across most of SAS, where suppressed convergence is consistent with the drying, except over the northwestern parts (Figures 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>a–
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>c and 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0009" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9</xref>d–
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0009" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9</xref>f). Although the changes are smaller in comparison, there are similarly competing changes from land cover and irrigation on the summer monsoon circulation and moisture convergence over EAS.
