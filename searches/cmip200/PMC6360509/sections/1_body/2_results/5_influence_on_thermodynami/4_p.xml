<p class="p">Amplifying effects of irrigation relative to land cover changes on the circulation and moisture convergence are observed over WAS, CNA, and the MED, consistent with their precipitation responses (Figure 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0009" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9</xref>). Over WAS, irrigation amplifies the land cover‐induced low‐level (850 hPa) convergence over the Arabian Peninsula mainly in the summer season. While there is relatively little irrigation over the Arabian Peninsula, these large circulation changes are indicative of the remote effects of irrigation, potentially a response to the larger‐scale modulation of temperature gradients by heavier irrigation in the northern part of WAS or a response to the substantial circulation anomalies associated with irrigation over SAS. Similar enhancing effects of irrigation are seen on moisture convergence over the MED mainly in the fall, when the strongest precipitation increases occur in response to irrigation. This occurs through anomalous westerly flow over much of the region. Such similarities and differences in the circulation changes provide a mechanism to explain the amplifying and contrasting precipitation responses over these regions.
