<p class="p">Given the strongest influence on the low‐level circulation over SAS relative to the rest of the domain (Figure 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0011" ref-type="fig" class="xref">11</xref>), we delve deeper into understanding the contrasting responses of land cover and irrigation on the circulation over SAS (Figure 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0011" ref-type="fig" class="xref">11</xref>). During spring, strong upper‐level westerly flow persists over northern SAS, which has an influence on precipitation over northern and northeastern SAS (Tyagi et al., 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-bib-0085" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Land cover changes lead to a northward shift in the climatological westerlies over the region, which is linked to declines in precipitation over these regions (Figure 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S2</xref>). Irrigation causes a contrasting southward shift and a strengthened circulation, which enhances precipitation over these South Asian subregions (Figure 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S2</xref>). In addition, irrigation contributes to increases in low‐level (up to 700 hPa) moisture availability, which do not occur with land surface changes alone (Figures 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0012" ref-type="fig" class="xref">12</xref>a–
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0012" ref-type="fig" class="xref">12</xref>c), further supporting the relative enhancement of rainfall over northern SAS in contrast to the decline in response to land cover alone during spring. Winter season circulation and precipitation responses to these forcings are similar to the spring season changes (Figures 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S5</xref>).
