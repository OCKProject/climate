<p class="p">During the summer season, the circulation reverses and is associated with westerly flow in the lower troposphere and easterly flow in the upper troposphere (Figure 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0011" ref-type="fig" class="xref">11</xref>d). Both agricultural land cover change and irrigation are associated with enhanced moisture availability along northern SAS, with much greater enhancement at the surface and lower troposphere with the latter (Figures 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0012" ref-type="fig" class="xref">12</xref>d–
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0012" ref-type="fig" class="xref">12</xref>f). This enhancement is mainly concentrated in the northern regions associated with widespread agricultural land cover change and intensification along the Indo‐Gangetic Plain. While the circulation response to land cover change is largely restricted to a slight strengthening of the upper‐level easterly jet over the ocean, the response to irrigation is a weakening at the upper and lower levels, indicative of a weakened monsoonal circulation over SAS (Figures 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0011" ref-type="fig" class="xref">11</xref>d–
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0011" ref-type="fig" class="xref">11</xref>f). The weakened circulation but enhanced moisture availability in response to irrigation has competing effects on the monsoon, with the weakened circulation slightly outweighing the latter, leading to weaker summer monsoon rainfall across most of SAS except the northwest. Over the northwestern part, the increased lower level moisture availability has a downstream wetting influence where it is in concert with the land cover forced changes (Figures
