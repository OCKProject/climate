<p class="p">In addition to local changes, such changes in moisture availability and circulation also have impacts in remote regions that need to be considered. Enhanced moisture fluxes from the surface could also lead to increased upper tropospheric temperatures through diabatic heating such as over SAS in spring (Figures

 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0008" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref>b). In addition, in both spring and summer seasons, irrigation influences the zonal wind strength by up to 7% in the midlatitudes (north of 25°N). Such changes can have downstream effects, such as over EAS. In addition, enhanced low‐level moisture availability over northern SAS can be linked to the enhancement of moisture transport over the WAS and CAS (Figure 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0009" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9</xref>). While the current suite of simulations does not tease apart the local versus remote effects, the strong precipitation enhancement over these regions despite comparably low irrigation rates suggests the potential for substantial remote effects.
