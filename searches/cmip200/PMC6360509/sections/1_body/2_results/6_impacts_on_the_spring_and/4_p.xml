 <italic class="italic">P</italic> − ET is reduced over SAS (Table 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>), owing to substantial ET increases and relatively little changes in annual precipitation. However, our current circulation analysis indicates enhanced moisture divergence (Figure 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0009" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9</xref>) and reduced circulation strength (Figure 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0011" ref-type="fig" class="xref">11</xref>) during the monsoon season, when the region typically receives the majority of its annual precipitation. When combined, these results suggest that while irrigation reduces the monsoonal moisture transport over SAS, enhanced ET resulting from the substantial added irrigation water may recycle moisture to maintain much of the annual precipitation amount. However, we further note that despite little overall change in SAS‐averaged precipitation, its spatial distribution is substantially changed (Figure 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Precipitation is locally enhanced over the most heavily irrigated regions, while precipitation deficits manifest over much of peninsular India (Figures 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S2</xref>).
