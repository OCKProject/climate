<p class="p">To further understand the influence of these land surface forcings on net surface radiation in the two scenarios, we examine the changes in surface shortwave and longwave components in a subset of SREX regions that experience the largest changes or contrasting responses of land cover change and irrigation (Figure 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). Land cover changes mainly alter surface radiation through changes in shortwave fluxes, whereas irrigation, and the resulting Bowen ratio changes, mainly decreases upward longwave radiation (LWUP) due to its surface cooling effect. In CAS, WAS, and the MED, where land cover changes cause an increase in net surface radiation in most seasons, the increases are largely associated with changes in shortwave fluxes with relatively small changes in longwave fluxes in all seasons except the summer. Decrease in albedo due to crops replacing areas of sparse vegetation (Table 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>) lead to decreases in outgoing shortwave radiation (OUTSW) in all three seasons in WAS, and summer and fall in CAS and the MED, with smaller decreases in incoming shortwave radiation (INSW). The addition of irrigation amplifies the net surface radiation (NET) changes in all three regions, with the largest changes during the peak growing season. Enhanced cloud cover with irrigation (
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">Figure S4</xref>) leads to decreases in INSW and increases in downward longwave radiation over these regions. LWUP also decreases due to surface cooling. Therefore, the decreases in INSW are compensated by the resulting net increases in surface longwave radiation, contributing to enhance NET over these regions.
