<p class="p">Changes over CNA and SAS contrast these patterns. Over CNA where crops replace denser forest vegetation (albedo increases; Table 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>), crops have the opposite effect of increasing OUTSW and therefore reducing NET, but changes in other fluxes vary by season (Figures 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>d–
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>f). INSW decreases in the summer along with decreases in LWUP, but the opposite changes occur in the fall. Irrigation amplifies the changes in shortwave and longwave radiation in the summer and reverses the land cover forced changes in fall. Over SAS, land cover forced changes are relatively small but irrigation effects are among the strongest across all five regions (Figures 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>j–
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>l). Substantial surface cooling associated with irrigation leads to large decreases in LWUP in the region for all three seasons, increasing net radiation and overwhelming the contrasting response associated with land cover change. Coincident with the timing of peak irrigation, the largest changes are found in spring (Figure 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>j). Similar to other regions, enhanced atmospheric moisture and cloud cover reduces INSW over SAS in spring (Figures 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>j and 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S4</xref>). However, the opposite effect occurs in the summer, the only season with substantial declines in cloud cover, contributing to the overall increase in NET (Figures 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>j, 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>k, and 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S4</xref>).
