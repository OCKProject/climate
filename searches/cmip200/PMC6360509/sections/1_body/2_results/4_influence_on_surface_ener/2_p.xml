<p class="p">To understand the causes of amplifying or contrasting impacts of irrigation relative to land cover change on surface climate, we examine their influence on the net radiative fluxes at the surface and their energy partitioning into latent and sensible heat fluxes, which ultimately influence surface climate. Net surface radiative flux is defined as the sum of the net shortwave and longwave radiation at the surface. We evaluate changes in these quantities during the three seasons with the most significant changes and contrasts between the two scenarios—spring (March‐April‐May), summer (June‐July‐August), and fall (September‐October‐November)— (Figures
