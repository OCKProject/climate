<p class="p">The contrasting effects of irrigation on surface temperature can be explained by its influence on the net surface radiation and Bowen ratio. The starkest contrast in net surface radiation changes between the two scenarios is over SAS. Particularly over the heavily irrigated regions of SAS, irrigation leads to large increases in net surface radiation that contrast the negative impacts of land cover changes alone (Figures

 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>f). Across much of SAS, CAS, and WAS, enhanced soil moisture associated with irrigation increases latent heat fluxes and reduces the Bowen ratio (Figures

 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>f). Despite the increases in net surface radiation, these significant and large decreases in Bowen ratio associated with relative increases in latent heat fluxes overwhelm the contrasting effects of land cover changes to cause relative cooling over these regions (Figures

 <xref rid="jgrd55039-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S2</xref>). These effects are strongest and most widespread during the spring and summer, when the irrigation rates are highest but persist into the fall over some areas. Associated with peak irrigation rates during the main growing season, irrigation also leads to significant decreases in the Bowen ratio due to an increase in latent heat fluxes and consequential cooling over CAS, WAS, and the MED (Figures

 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>l). These changes occur in the two other seasons as well but are less widespread. Over other regions, irrigation effects on surface energy fluxes are relatively small.
