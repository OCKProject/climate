<p class="p">Here we contrast the climate responses across the nine SREX regions to these forcings, which are representative of the effects of agricultural land conversion and agricultural intensification, relative to a climate with natural vegetation. Since external forcings are identical for the length of the simulation, the year‐to‐year differences only represent the internal atmospheric variability in the 
 <italic class="italic">forced</italic> response to different surface conditions. For the forced climate response to land cover change or irrigation, we calculate the difference in the mean climate across 50 years of the Crops and IrrigatedCrops scenarios relative to the NatVeg scenario. To estimate the statistical significance of the distribution of differences between each set of scenarios, we apply the two‐sided Student's 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> test.
