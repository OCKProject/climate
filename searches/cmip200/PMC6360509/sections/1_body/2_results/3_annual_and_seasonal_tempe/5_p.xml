<p class="p">To further assess the relative importance of irrigation to the annual hydrological balance, Table 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref> shows the annual precipitation (P), evapotranspiration (ET), and added irrigation water across our focus regions. Also shown are differences in these quantities (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> and ET) from the NatVeg experiment. Irrigation reduces annual 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> − ET most substantially in SAS, CAM, and CAS. While both precipitation and ET increase over CAM and CAS, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> − ET reductions result from higher ET increases relative to precipitation. In SAS, however, annual precipitation does not undergo a substantial change (and is actually slightly reduced), while ET significantly increases. Across the other regions, however, annually added irrigation water does not substantially alter 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> − ET (as averaged over these regions). These annual results are consistent with our above described seasonal findings across these regions, particularly where irrigation negates land cover‐induced changes.
