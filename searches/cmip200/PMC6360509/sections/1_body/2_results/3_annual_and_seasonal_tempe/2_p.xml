<p class="p">On an annual scale, agriculture‐driven land cover change (Crops‐NatVeg) significantly enhances precipitation in many agricultural areas with the exception of TIB and northern SAS (Figure 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>a). Over the regions that experience precipitation increases associated with agriculture, addition of irrigation enhances this amplification of precipitation with the largest effects—increases of 18–24% relative to land cover forced changes—over WAS (Figures 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>b and 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>c). However, over other regions that experience precipitation declines associated with agriculture, addition of irrigation to croplands leads to competing changes in precipitation relative to those induced by agricultural land cover change alone, either dampening the land cover‐induced changes or causing changes of the opposite sign (Figures 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). Over much of CAS, TIB, and northern SAS where crop cover‐induced changes were negative or insignificant, addition of irrigation causes relative increases in precipitation of &gt;30% (Figures 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>b and 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>c). In contrast, over peninsular India, irrigation causes a relative reduction in annual precipitation of 12–18% where land cover changes alone increase precipitation (Figures 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>a and 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>c).
