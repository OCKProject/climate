<p class="p">Although the impacts of temperature are largely similar across seasons, precipitation impacts vary considerably in magnitude and direction (Figures 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S3</xref>). To characterize their effects by season, we quantify the area‐weighted average monthly temperature and precipitation changes in the two forcing scenarios relative to the Natural Vegetation scenario for each of the nine regions (Figure 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). The amplifying and contrasting effects of irrigation on land cover‐induced changes are more prominent on the monthly time scale. Among these regions, the effects of both forcings vary by season, and significant changes also occur outside the primary growing season. The most significant precipitation increases in response to land cover changes occurs over SAS during the premonsoon and monsoon seasons (March–July) and over MED and WAS during late spring, summer, and fall (May–October; Figure 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>a). During these seasons, irrigation amplifies land cover‐induced precipitation increases over WAS by ~10–18% and over the MED by ~4–20% in different months (Figures 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>a and 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>b). In addition, irrigation causes large and significant increases in precipitation over CAS, with the magnitudes varying between 8% and 35% in different months (Figure 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>b). SAS is the most prominent example of the contrasting influence of these forcings, where the addition of irrigation opposes the land cover forced precipitation increases with relative reductions of between 5% and 10% during the premonsoon and summer monsoon months, leading to little overall change in precipitation in response to the combined forcings (Figure 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>b). In addition, irrigation also weakens the land cover change induced precipitation declines during most seasons except winter over TIB and in September–October over CNA and reverses the negative precipitation response to land cover during the winter over SAS (Figures 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>a and 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>b). The effects of irrigation are relatively small and less consistent in other regions.
