<p class="p">In contrast to the mixed precipitation responses, irrigation largely causes cooling relative to land cover‐induced changes in most seasons (Figures 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>c and 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>d). The most robust changes in response to land cover occur in the spring and early part of the growing seasons. Land cover changes lead to strong and robust cooling over CEU from February to August (~0.8–1.3 °C), EAS from February to August (0.4–0.9 °C), and CNA from March to July (0.4–0.6 °C) and moderate cooling in some seasons in other regions where crops replace denser forest cover (Figure 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>c). However, land cover change leads to moderate warming over CAS and TIB in May–September (0.2–0.3 °C) and WAS in December–February (0.4–0.6 °C), where cropping occurs on areas of sparse vegetation (Figure 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>c). With added irrigation, there is significant cooling across most regions and seasons with a few exceptions, such as the relative warming effect over CEU during February–March (Figure 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>d). Peak cooling in most regions generally tends to co‐occur with the timing of the peak irrigation rates. The strongest effect of irrigation occurs over SAS, with cooling of 1–1.5 °C during January–May when the effects of land cover are insignificant and amplifies the land cover‐induced cooling by 0.4–0.9 °C in the remaining months (Figure 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>d). In addition, irrigation causes significant cooling over CNA, EAS, WAS, and the MED, amplifying the effects of land cover change, and reverses the warming associated with land cover change over CAS and TIB, during the height of the growing season (June–September; Figures
