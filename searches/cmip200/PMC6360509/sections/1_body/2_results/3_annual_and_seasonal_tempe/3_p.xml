<p class="p">Similarly, these land surface forcings also have opposite influences on annual mean surface temperatures over some regions, including parts of CAM, WAS, CAS, and northern SAS (Figures

 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>f). While land cover change alone leads to warming of between 0.3 and 0.9 °C in these regions, the addition of irrigation largely masks this warming and instead has a uniform cooling effect (Figures

 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>e). The relative cooling effect exceeds −1.5 °C over the heavily irrigated parts of northern SAS and CAS (Figure 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>f). In contrast, the impacts of these forcings are similar in sign over much of TIB and EAS, where irrigation amplifies the cooling effect of crops by 0.3–0.6 °C.
