<p class="p">Such changes to the circulation can affect climate in remote regions in addition to local impacts through temperature and moisture advection. Some examples of such potential remote or downstream effects in other regions are also noted in several studies (Mahmood et al.,

 <xref rid="jgrd55039-bib-0094" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>) for tropospheric temperature impacts in response to land cover changes and by Lo and Famiglietti (
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>) for precipitation in response to irrigation addition. In our study, the strong enhancement of rainfall over parts of WAS and CAS that are not colocated with the heaviest irrigation rates are likely the remote effects of the enhancement of moisture convergence from the irrigated areas of SAS. In addition, the relatively large changes in surface temperatures over CAS and TIB, and in upper tropospheric temperatures over the MED, CAS, and WAS, also highlight such remote effects. While changes in the primary growing season are associated with widespread irrigation across multiple regions, winter season changes are largely a response to irrigation over SAS. Wey et al. (
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-bib-0089" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) show that the remote impacts of this wintertime irrigation over SAS can extend into the midlatitudes as far as North America, where it affects surface climate through a deepening of the Aleutian Low. (Though not shown, our simulations show a similar response of irrigation relative to land cover changes alone). Together, these results indicate the importance of considering land cover change and land management as distinct forcings over irrigated and nonirrigated areas.
