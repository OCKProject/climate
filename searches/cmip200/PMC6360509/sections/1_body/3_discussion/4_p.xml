<p class="p">In contrast to the largely consistent cooling effect on temperature, irrigation has varied effects on precipitation across different regions (Figures 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). Though the largest impacts of irrigation occur during the main growing season across the regions considered here, there are also considerable effects on precipitation in the spring and fall season across parts of Asia. Over most regions, irrigated croplands tend to enhance primary growing season precipitation in addition to the effect of land cover changes alone. However, over SAS and CAS, the influence of irrigation opposes the wetting influence of land cover change only during the summer monsoon season and is sufficiently strong to reverse the direction of changes. The relative weakening effect of irrigation on the Indian summer monsoon rainfall is consistent with previous studies (Cook et al.,

 <xref rid="jgrd55039-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>; Guimberteau et al.,

 <xref rid="jgrd55039-bib-0080" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). However, the magnitude of this effect found in our study is smaller than that found in Douglas et al. (
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>) and Guimberteau et al. (
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>), potentially due to differences in climate models, spatial resolutions, physical representation of irrigation in the studies, and experimental designs. Consistent with Guimberteau et al. (
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>) and Shukla et al. (
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-bib-0080" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>), precipitation declines occur primarily due to decreases in total column moisture over most of India and weakening of the circulation with irrigation, which are in contrast to the land cover forced changes. This circulation weakening leads to reduced low‐level convergence, which along with reduced MSE have a drying effect on precipitation despite an increase in moisture availability. This is in contrast to the moderate surface warming and enhanced convergence over the region induced by land cover changes alone.
