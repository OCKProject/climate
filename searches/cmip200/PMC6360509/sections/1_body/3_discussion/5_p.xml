<p class="p">The differences in surface temperature response are largely due to the different impacts of land cover change and irrigation on the partitioning of surface fluxes into latent and sensible fluxes (Figure 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). The contrasting, but comparable, impacts of irrigation and land cover change on surface energy partitioning at a global scale are similar to the findings over India in Douglas et al. (
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). In addition to substantial changes in energy partitioning, irrigation also considerably increases NET, which enhances surface energy availability over the heavily irrigated parts of Asia, reversing the effect of land cover changes (Figures 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). The contrasting responses of NET in these experiments arise from land cover changes modulating shortwave fluxes through albedo changes and irrigation modulating shortwave and longwave fluxes through enhanced near‐surface moisture and surface cooling (Figures 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-fig-0012" ref-type="fig" class="xref">12</xref>, and 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S4</xref>). Our results indicate that irrigation‐induced cooling reduces LWUP over most regions, and the associated enhancement of near‐surface atmospheric moisture and cloud cover increases downward longwave radiation and decreases incoming shortwave radiation over some regions, consistent with the findings of Cook et al.
