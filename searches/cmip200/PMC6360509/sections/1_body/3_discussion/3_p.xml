<p class="p">We compare and contrast the climatic effects of agricultural land conversion and intensification across nine heavily irrigated regions of the world. Coincident with the highest irrigation rates and most extensive agricultural expansion, the strongest surface and atmospheric changes in response to these forcings occur over Asia during multiple seasons. Land cover change alone can cause regional warming despite being an overall negative global forcing (Myhre et al., 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Irrigation combined with land cover change has a strong cooling effect in most regions, consistent with previous findings (e.g., Cook et al., 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>; McDermid et al., 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>; Sacks et al.,

 <xref rid="jgrd55039-bib-0082" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>), that is sufficiently strong to reverse these positive temperature changes. For instance, irrigation causes 2–3 times as much cooling over much of Asia as the simulated land cover forced warming (0.3–0.6 °C; Figure

This implies that neglecting the effect of irrigation would lead to underestimating the effect of land surface changes on historical climate. In the future, the lack of irrigation due to water shortage in vulnerable parts of Asia, which are already experiencing rapid depletion of groundwater and freshwater resources (Elliott et al., 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>; Rodell et al., 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-bib-0073" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>), could result in amplified warming in currently irrigated croplands.
