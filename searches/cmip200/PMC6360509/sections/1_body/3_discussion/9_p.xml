<p class="p">Our findings are based on simulations with a single GCM and with realistic but time‐invariant forcings. While this allows us to clearly identify the climatic responses to these forcings, this design poses some important limitations to the conclusions of this study. First, there are limitations in the model representation of irrigation and crops. Irrigation is potentially overestimated in the current model since the irrigation module applies irrigation to an entire vegetated fraction of the grid cell even if it is only partially cropped (Cook et al., 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>; Puma &amp; Cook, 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-bib-0066" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>; Shukla et al., 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-bib-0080" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Model development efforts targeted at improving the representation of these processes are required for a better understanding of the impact of these forcings. Second, different models have different land surface representations, parameterizations, irrigation schemes, and biases, which could result in differing simulated responses to these surface changes (e.g., Boisier et al., 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>; de Noblet‐Ducoudré et al., 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>; Lawrence et al., 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>; Pitman et al., 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-bib-0064" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>; Quesada et al., 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-bib-0069" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). Although LUCID allowed for such comparisons of the land cover change effects, this ensemble is still limited compared to the suite of CMIP5 models. The new set of simulations that will be part of the Land Use Model Intercomparison Project contribution to CMIP6 (Lawrence et al., 
 <xref rid="jgrd55039-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>) could help address this limitation. Third, the coarse model resolution likely does not capture the spatial heterogeneity in the surface forcings considered here and important fine‐scale interactions and feedbacks and potentially overestimates irrigation at the grid scale. Although some studies have employed regional climate models for such assessments, higher‐resolution GCMs are needed for comparing these effects across regions and capturing the potential remote effects highlighted in this study and previous studies. Four, the isolated transient climate response could likely be different than the equilibrium climate response that is examined here. In the real world, these forcings occur along with other external forcings such as greenhouse gases and aerosols that could modulate the response to these surface forcings. Therefore, the interactions of these land surface forcings with other anthropogenic climate forcings need to be further disentangled and investigated.
