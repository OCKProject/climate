<p class="p">Our analysis also demonstrates that the individual and relative regional effects of crop cover and irrigation can vary considerably by season. For instance, changes from natural vegetation to croplands cause significant surface warming over WAS in the winter months but have a negligible effect in the summer season when vegetation growth typically peaks. However, the strongest cooling effect of irrigation over this region occurs during the spring and summer months. In addition, irrigation has a relative warming effect during February–April over the MED but a relative cooling effect during most other months. Similarly, over SAS, irrigation has a drying effect relative to land cover change on rainfall during May–September but has a small wetting in winter months. Given these varying effects, our results underscore the importance of considering the impacts of land cover change and irrigation across multiple seasons and not just the primary growing season (Ge,
