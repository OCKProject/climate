<p class="p">Uncertainties in climate change issues are not only the future global mean temperature changes (Δ
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>). For example, it is uncertain how climate change might impact the natural biosphere, agricultural production and human society, which are critical issues in policy making. The development and implementation of energy technologies as well as their societal acceptance are key factors, especially relation to carbon capture and storage (CCS) and geo-engineering options. In this sense, climate change issues should be discussed from the perspective of risk management involving multiple research fields. The Japanese Ministry of the Environment established an inter-disciplinary research project, entitled “Integrated Climate Assessment-Risks, Uncertainties, and Society (ICA-RUS)” conducted by Dr. Seita Emori of the National Institute for Environmental Studies (NIES) for the period of 2012–2016. The purpose of the ICA-RUS project is to provide a basis for the social deliberation on long-term climate goals by exploring advantages and disadvantages involving different targets from a risk management perspective. ICA-RUS attempts to integrate insights from areas of climate risk assessment, energy economics modeling, the energy–water–food–ecosystem nexus, and science and technology studies. The objective of ICA-RUS is first to set a mitigation target (including 1.5 and 2.0 °C), and then assessing the consequences and their ranges. Climatic, mitigative, and socioeconomic uncertainties are then considered. ICA-RUS involves climate science, engineering, economics, and sociology to integrate the climate change impacts, mitigation options, and societal acceptance of stakeholders as a risk management approach. Further details of ICA-RUS are described by Emori et.al. (
