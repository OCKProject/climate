<p class="p">Most existing mitigation studies use range of uncertainty of climate projections (or climate parameters such as climate sensitivity) obtained from ensembles of GCMs. However, the uncertainty range of the future global mean temperature changes (Δ
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>) is expected to decline in the future thanks to new observations, greater warming signals, and further progress in understanding the climate system. Previous studies have investigated how the effects of possible future learning about climate change might affect mitigation analyses (Manne and Richels
