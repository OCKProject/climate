<p class="p">The 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference (also known as COP21), followed by the Paris Agreement stated that “Emphasizing with serious concern the urgent need to address the significant gap between the aggregate effect of Parties’ mitigation pledges in terms of global annual emissions of greenhouse gases by 2020 and aggregate emission pathways consistent with holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 °C above preindustrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C above preindustrial levels” (UNFCC 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">2015</xref>). However, current scientific knowledge is far from identifying the emission pathways to achieve this target. Uncertainties in the projections of global mean temperature change by global climate models (GCMs) become uncertainties in mitigation pathways holding the 1.5 and 2.0 °C targets. Under such uncertainties in the climate changes, the following three questions should be raised: first, when and how will the uncertainty range on the global temperature rise be eliminated, which global emission pathway should be chosen in the absence of perfect information, and how much expenditure is justified in reducing the climate uncertainties.
