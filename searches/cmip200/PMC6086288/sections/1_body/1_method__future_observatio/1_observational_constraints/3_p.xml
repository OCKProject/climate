<p class="p">We apply the same method as Shiogama et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">2016</xref>) to estimate the future decline of the Δ
 <italic class="italic">T</italic> uncertainty in the 2090s using all the four RCPs, whereas Shiogama et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">2016</xref>) analyzed each of four RCPs, respectively. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> shows the decline of Δ
 <italic class="italic">T</italic> uncertainty by the 2090s thanks to the update of observations. The uncertainty range of Δ
 <italic class="italic">T</italic> rapidly decreases as the more observation data accumulate. We can accurately reduce more than 60% of the Δ
 <italic class="italic">T</italic> uncertainty in the 2090s by 2039 and about 80% by 2089. The reduction rate of the Δ
 <italic class="italic">T</italic> uncertainty is improved because of the increase in the analyzed GCM data size. Shiogama et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">2016</xref>) concluded that 60% of the Δ
 <italic class="italic">T</italic> uncertainty will be reduced by 2049, but that occurs by 2039 in this study. Although Shiogama et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">2016</xref>) proposed a method for how observations reduce the future temperature rise uncertainty, they did not touch upon the mitigation strategies and actions. The present paper investigates the pathways of mitigation option implementations and evaluates the value of observation applying the expanded ATL method to the integrated assessment model MARIA.
