<p class="p">When considering future climate changes, we require standardized plural scenarios on the climate control target to compare the model results. The climate research community has, therefore, developed four possible greenhouse gas concentration pathways under different climate control policies. These are known as representative concentration pathways (RCPs) (Collins et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">2013</xref>; Vuuren et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">2011</xref>) where the radiative forcing in 2100 is constrained to 8.5 W/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> (RCP8.5), 6.0 W/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> (RCP6.0), 4.5 W/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> (RCP4.5) and 2.6 W/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> (RCP2.6). However, future climate change projections contain intrinsic uncertainties. A method was proposed to constrain the uncertainty in Δ
 <italic class="italic">T</italic> by evaluating GCMs’ climate simulations and comparing them with the historical observations of surface air temperature (Allen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">2000</xref>; Stott and Kettleborough 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">2002</xref>). This is named Allen–Stott–Kettleborough (ASK) method. Its basic idea is simple: if GCM overestimates the observed magnitude of historical climate change, it will overestimate future climate change by a proportional amount, and vice versa. The future projections of Δ
 <italic class="italic">T</italic> are scaled up or down by this proportional amount, and the uncertainty ranges due to the internal climate variability are estimated.
