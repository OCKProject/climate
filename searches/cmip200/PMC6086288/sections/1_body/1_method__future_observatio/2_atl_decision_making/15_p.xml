<p class="p">It should be noted that the concept of “value of information” or “value of scientific knowledge” is extremely broad. It extends from conventional cost-and-benefit analysis approach employed herein to technological and societal innovation as yet unknown. For instance, few people in the previous century could have imagined today’s progress in the information technology or artificial intelligence. Such new knowledge or a big innovation would substantially alter the policies on climate change. However, we cannot evaluate these values nor can we rely on such advance to provide today’s decision. However, there are some possible options with expected large potential and high barriers (e.g., nuclear fusion reactor, space solar power systems (SSPS), and geo-engineering options). The method described herein might be applicable to evaluating these “uncertain” options.</p>
