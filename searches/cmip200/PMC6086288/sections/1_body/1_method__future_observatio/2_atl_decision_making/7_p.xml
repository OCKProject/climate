<p class="p">For example, future population growth rates up to 2100 are categorized into 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic> = {very low, low, middle, high, very high}, but information on the actual rate is lacking. In 2050, the future population growth might be recognized as 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic> = {{very low, low}, {middle}, {high, very high}}. If the future population post-2050 is narrowed to {very low, low}, the decision-making can exclude the other possibilities.
