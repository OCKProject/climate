<p class="p">We applied the above uncertainty-decreasing process to multi-stage decision-making. This is known as the Act Then Learn (ATL) procedure, and was first applied to the GLOBAL 2100 model (Manne and Richels 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">1992</xref>). FigureÂ 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> shows the decision-making frames under uncertainties of (a) perfect ex ante information [Learn Then Act (LTA)] decision-making, (b) single-stage decision-making without learning and (c) multi-stage decision-making the ATL learning process. If the future uncertainty is completely resolved prior to the decision-making at the initial time, then the decision maker can select the optimal strategy corresponding to the foreseeable future [case (a)]. On the contrary, if no opportunity to revise the plan arises after the decision-making, the policy maker must select the initial action that maximizes a given objective function such as the expected discounted utility [case (b)]. If the policy maker can change the action based on the learning procedure at an intermediate time
