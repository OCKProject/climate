<p class="p">We estimated that the value of full information with a 2.0 °C target is approximately 4.5 times of that with a 2.5 °C. With a 2.0 °C target case, the value of learning information, which is defined as the mitigation of GDP, is almost 3.31 2005 US trillion dollars (approximately 2.19% of GDP without learning) per year while that with full information from the beginning is 5.87 2005 US trillion dollars (approximately 3.88% of GDP without learning). Comparing these values with the losses of GDP under the 450-ppmv control scenario from GDP without climate policy reported in IPCC-AR5-WG3 (IPCC-AR5-WG3 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">2014c</xref>), the value of information indicates almost half of GDP losses between BAU and climate policy case. Thus, we can conclude that the scientific knowledge is still valuable even if the uncertainties in the climate sensitivity are not fully resolved.
