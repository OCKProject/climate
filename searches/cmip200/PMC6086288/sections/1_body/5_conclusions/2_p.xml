<p class="p">We assessed how the CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emission pathways are affected by different decision-making procedures. The simulation shows that the emissions should be minimized without information. The implementation of CCS and biomass shows different patterns, whereby CCS is implemented at its minimum level without learning. CCS implementation increases as the information on the possibility of higher climate sensitivity reveals. In contrast, biomass is expanded at its maximum level and then decreases as the possibility of lower climate sensitivity appears.
