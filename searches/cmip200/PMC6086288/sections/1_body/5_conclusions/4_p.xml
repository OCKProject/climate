<p class="p">Since the Paris Agreement has taken effect, the effects and possibility of a 1.5 °C target have been widely discussed as a more preferable target, although its difficulty under current technology has also been pointed out. In fact, the multi-model approach adopted by the ICA-RUS project shows that two of four integrated assessment models (including MARIA) could not find feasible solutions under the 1.5 °C target with a 3.6 °C equilibrium climate sensitivity for the SSP2 scenario (Mori et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">2017</xref>). In this study, MARIA could not find feasible solutions for the 1.5 °C target when the equilibrium climate sensitivity was larger than 3.0 °C. We should consider additional innovative technological options even if large uncertainty is expected to accommodate the possibility of a 1.5 °C target.
