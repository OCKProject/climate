<p class="p">Comparing carbon emissions between Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref> gives interesting findings. First, although single-stage energy-based emissions are identical among the cases, those with land use changes and a biosphere shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>b yield small differences. This is because emissions from land use changes and biosphere can vary according to the different global warming caused by the different climate sensitivities. Future climate changes and their impacts as warming damage affect the present behavior, even if energy technology implementation and economic activities such as investment are constrained to be identical among the scenarios because MARIA is an inter-temporal perfectly foreseeable optimization.
