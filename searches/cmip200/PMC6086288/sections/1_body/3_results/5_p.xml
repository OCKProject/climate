<p class="p">Second, energy-based carbon emissions under LTA and single-stage decision-making in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>a, b show around 4Gt-CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> higher values than those in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>a, b, respectively. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>, the carbon emissions from land use changes and a biosphere are always positive in these two cases. By contrast, in the LTA decision case, as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>c, the land use changes such as afforestation work as absorption sources. This case obviously appears in {4,5,6}–{4,5}–{4} and {4,5,6}–{4,5}–{5} scenarios. This might be because final state {6} requires most stringent emission reduction because the target temperature rise in the two high-equilibrium climate sensitivity categories {7} and {8} is relaxed to 2.5 °C. Therefore, the land use change policy should have been most serious in {4,5,6} case in which 2.0 °C target is needed against high climate sensitivity. When the climate change appears not so serious in the second stage, the policy could work as carbon sink.
