<p class="p">Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig" class="xref">10</xref> compares the biomass energy utilization in the different decision-making cases. In contrast to the case of CCS, biomass demand in the single-stage decision-making (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig" class="xref">10</xref>b) is higher than that in the LTA perfect-information case (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig" class="xref">10</xref>a). So long as high future global warming is possible, the suggestion is to prioritize the expansion of biomass. The results for ATL yield fluctuating patterns. As suggested in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig" class="xref">10</xref>a, using biomass as an energy source is not the first priority when climate change is low. If multi-stage decision-making is available, biomass utilization should be implemented flexibly according to the knowledge acquisition.
