<p class="p">In the MARIA calculation with ATL, the global average temperature rise was constrained to below 2 °C from pre-industrial level. However, in the two highest equilibrium climate sensitivity cases, MARIA failed to provide feasible solutions. Thus, we relaxed the warming limitation and constrained the fuel-based carbon emission limitation in the scenarios with final state {7} and {8} to give below 2.5 °C rather than 2 °C.</p>
