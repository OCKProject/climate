<p class="p">We focus on the CCS implementation patterns and biomass energy demands among the cases to determine how the technology strategy changes under the different decision-making procedures. The role of CCS in the Paris Agreement has been pointed out in many literature sources including IPCC-AR5-WG3 (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">2014a</xref>), this being despite the high barrier to large scale deployment (IPCC-AR5-WG3 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">2014b</xref>). The expansion of CCS should be planned carefully because little co-benefit of CCS implementation is expected. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9</xref> shows the CCS implementation results in the different decision-making cases. First, decision-making under uncertainty preferred minimum implementation of CCS because CCS is expensive and lowers the energy conversion efficiency. Second, the temperature rise at the end of the twenty-first century can exceed 2 °C in the two highest climate sensitivity cases {7} and {8}. There is less need for CCS in these cases, and so CCS in single-stage decision-making is implemented moderately.
