 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref> summarizes the changes in cumulative GDP with different decision-making processes and different targets. The information values and their contribution ratios, TVPI, TVPIR, TVLP and TVLPR are calculated based on the changes in cumulative GDP between the learning and no-learning (single-stage decision-making) cases. We calculated TVPI and TVLP under zero discount rate. It is well known that the assumption on the discount rate is highly controversial (IPCC-AR4-WG3 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">2007</xref>). The discounted present value is often calculated under a discount rate of 5%, whereas discount rate of 1.5% is widely used for the discounting the social time preference utility in the integrated assessment models (Nordhaus

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">2013</xref>). However, because the outcomes of scientific research often appear after many years later, unlike the investment and return of certain business project, it is questionable whether the concept of “discounted present value” is directly applicable. Thus, we tentatively adopted a zero discount rate when evaluating the average contribution of scientific information.
