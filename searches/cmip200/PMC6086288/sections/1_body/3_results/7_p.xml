<p class="p">Figures 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref> compare the optimal carbon emission pathways in LTA (perfect ex ante information), single-stage decision-making (no learning), and the ATL process. In the low-equilibrium climate sensitivity scenarios, the carbon emission results largely depend on the decision-making process. Note that single-stage decision-making yields the same emission pathways from energy in all equilibrium climate sensitivity scenarios, despite the different emissions from land use among the equilibrium climate sensitivity cases. This explains the small differences in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref> for the single-stage decision case. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref> compares the atmospheric temperature changes in LTA, ATL, and single-decision-making. In the highest equilibrium climate sensitivity scenarios (Scenarios 7 and 8), the temperature rise from pre-industrial levels in 2100 is approximately 2.5 °C. Conversely, the atmospheric temperature rise in the low-equilibrium climate sensitivity cases predicted by single-stage decision-making is approximately 1.85 °C. Figures 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref> suggest that single-stage decision-making tends to recommend lower emission pathways than do the other prediction processes.
