<p class="p">From Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>, we find that the value of information increases as the climate target policy becomes more stringent, being approximately 4.5 times higher with a 2.0 °C target than with a 2.5 °C target. Furthermore, the value of learning information with a 2.0 °C target is just over 3.31 trillion 2005 US dollars per year in ATL, while 5.87 trillion 2005 US dollars per year when full information is available from the beginning. Thus, scientific knowledge is valuable even when the uncertainties in equilibrium climate sensitivity are not fully resolved. In other words, expenditure on scientific research is rationalized when global climate changes are of true concern.
