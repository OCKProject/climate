<p class="p">Note that in contrast to previous ATL studies, the intermediate uncertainty sections overlap in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>. In this case, the {1,2,3}–{2,3}–{2} and {2,3,4}–{2,3}-{2} paths can give different results. We must simultaneously consider 24 paths with path-dependent cases to formulate the transition flow shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>. We divide the ATL calculation into six sub-models, each containing four mutually exclusive uncertain sections to avoid exceeding the capacity of the optimization software. The six sub-models A–F and their ATL calculations are given in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>. Although each sub-model generates eight ATL pathways, only four (those colored light-green in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>) constitute part of the original ATL model. Thus, this procedure approximates the solution from 24 pathways extracted from 48 available pathways.
