<p class="p">We begin by applying the lognormal distribution according to Lewandowski et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">2014</xref>) to the distribution in equilibrium climate sensitivity gathered in the CMIP5 GCMs (CMIP 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2017</xref>; Collins et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">2013</xref>) to represent the uncertainty elimination process described in the previous section. This distribution represents the range of scientific knowledge regarding future climate changes at the initial period year 2010. We divide the distribution into eight sections, each of which is assumed to gives a 1/8 probability to aggregate the uncertainty. We use the median of each section of the distribution as the representative of the category. The definition of eight categories of equilibrium climate sensitivity distribution and their representative values are shown in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>. More detailed division would be preferable to better approximate the distribution. We employed eight categories because of the limit on our numerical calculation.
