<p class="p">We still need approximately 3 months to obtain the approximated solution of these decomposed calculations by six PCs with 3.6 GHz core i7-4770 on GAMS24.4-CONOPT. This decomposition could have reduced the calculation but the ATL constraints given by Eq. (
 <xref rid="Equ3" ref-type="" class="xref">3</xref>) is guaranteed only within each sub-model. Nonetheless, we believe this approximation still makes sense to see the extended ATL decision.
