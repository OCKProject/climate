<p class="p">In the initial period, the range of our scientific knowledge is represented by the set of all categories {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}. Hereafter, we call the set of possible categories surrounded by braces as a “state”. State represents the possible range of equilibrium climate sensitivity at the certain period. The uncertainty resolving procedure in the above can be represented by the elimination of categories with probability 0. For example, the procedure {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}–{1, 2, 3} (in 2030)–{1,2} (in 2040)–{1} (beyond 2100) constitutes one scenario. These are summarized in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref> where 24 scenarios are identified corresponding to the set of scenarios 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic> = {s} in 2.2. The scenario probability is given as evenly as to give the final state probability 1/8 equally. For instance, only the scenario pathway {1,2,3}–{1,2}–(1} reaches final state {1}, whereas three pathways {1,2,3}–(1,2}–(2}, {1,2,3}–{2,3}–{2) and {2,3,4}–(2,3}–{2} reach finally state {2}. Similarly, four pathways reach finally state {3}. Because the probability of all final states is 1/8 equally, we allocate scenario pathway probabilities proportional to the inverse of the number of pathways which reach the certain final state.
