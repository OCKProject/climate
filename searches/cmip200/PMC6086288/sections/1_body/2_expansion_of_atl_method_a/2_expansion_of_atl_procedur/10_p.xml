<p class="p">Before the calculation of ATL and single-stage decision-making processes, the policy control variables to be constrained by Eq.Â (
 <xref rid="Equ3" ref-type="" class="xref">3</xref>) should be defined. In this study, first we imposed the ATL constraints on the investments in the economic activities and energy technologies such as power generation expansions and the fuel demands in term of fossil fuels and biomass. Note that land use change is excluded from the ATL constraints, because it can be adapted within a decade according to the climate changes. Second, even if investment is identical, outputs can vary depending on climate changes owing to the inclusion of warming damage terms; thus, even if energy-based emissions are similarly constrained, total carbon emissions will change depending on the climate sensitivity assumption.
