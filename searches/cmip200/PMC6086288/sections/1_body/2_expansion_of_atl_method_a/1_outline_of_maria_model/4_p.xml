    <italic class="italic">Carbon circulation and climate changes</italic> The Bern carbon cycle model (Joos et al. 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">2001</xref>) and a simple climate model block following DICE-2013R are incorporated. Equilibrium climate sensitivity is one of the key parameters of this block. Bern carbon cycle model and climate model deal with the simple feedback loop between temperature change and the carbon emission from biosphere.

    <italic class="italic">Nuclear fuel cycle</italic> Three reactor types are considered explicitly, namely a light water reactor (LWR), an LWR with Pu fuel (LWR-Pu) and a fast breeding reactor (FBR). Thus, MARIA tends to generate nuclear-oriented solution unless policy constraints on nuclear power are imposed.

    <italic class="italic">Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS)</italic> Three storage types are considered, namely aquifer, depleted gas wells and the deep ocean disposal. In MARIA, CCS can be implemented in energy sectors as power generation and industry sectors, if needed.

    <italic class="italic">Food demand and land use changes</italic> MARIA deals with land use changes among cropland, forest, pasture and other types based on the yield growth of crops and animals assuming simple demand functions for these foods. The trade-offs between food production and energy crops are explicitly formulated explicitly.
