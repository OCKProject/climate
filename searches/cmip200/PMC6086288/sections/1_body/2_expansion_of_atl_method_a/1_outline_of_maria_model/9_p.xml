<p class="p">Before the model simulation, it is fundamental to give the key drivers such as population, economic growth rates and technological progress in production processes. Unlike the models in the natural science fields, there should be various choices and possibilities in the future society. To share the common parameters for model simulations, the world climate community has developed the shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) to deal with future societal possibilities including population, gross domestic product (GDP), energy, land use, and greenhouse gas emissions identifying five different future scenarios (Riahi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">2017</xref>; Oâ€™Neill et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">2017</xref>). In our simulations, because AIM participated in the SSP activity and provided data set for the SSP scenarios (Fujimori et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">2017</xref>), we use the AIM outputs for SSP2 (Middle of the road), as references. We extract AIM-output scenario data concerning population, GDP in market exchange rate, final energy consumption, and GHG emission pathways. The assumptions made about other parameters related to resource endowment, renewable energy, and CCS potentials, as well as other costs, are discussed in the existing literature (Mori
