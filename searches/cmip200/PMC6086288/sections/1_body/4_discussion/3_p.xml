<p class="p">As Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref> suggests the total greenhouse gas emission fluctuates slightly because of the emissions from non-energy sources. The uncertainties in the emissions from non-energy sources and the mitigation options for these sources are limited. This issue becomes serious when we consider a 1.5 °C target because zero carbon emission would be insufficient. Thus, uncertainties in the emissions and mitigation options of non-energy sources should be evaluated in the next stage of this research.
