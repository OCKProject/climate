<p class="p">For the first purpose, the simulation results as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>b reveal the need to minimize the CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions in pathways unless future information on climate change is provided. By comparing Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>a, c, we see that the CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emission pathways should be constrained around 12 Gt-CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> by 2030 showing that the CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emission in 2000 should be cut almost 50% in 2030. This is because of the possibility of global warming that is higher than the median or mean climate sensitivity case. In other words, the decision of the climate policy should not be delayed if we are serious about adopting a stringent global-warming target. Relaxation of emission constraints is possible only if new scientific knowledge is acquired. If we can exclude the high climate sensitivity case, the constraint could also be relaxed before 2030.
