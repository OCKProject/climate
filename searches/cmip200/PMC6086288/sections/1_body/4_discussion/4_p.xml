<p class="p">Figures 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig" class="xref">10</xref> show the opposite properties of mitigation options. In single-stage decision-making, CCS is introduced at the minimum value given by LTA decision-making whereas biomass is adopted at the maximum value. CCS is implemented considering the lowest warming case, whereas biomass is not adopted. It should be noted that biomass utilization fluctuates complicatedly according to knowledge acquisition, as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig" class="xref">10</xref>c. Such fluctuations might imply short-term land-use changes because the expansion of biomass is strongly related to land-use changes as well as to food demand. Even if MARIA were to include a simple calculation of the emissions due to land-use changes, more detailed investigation would be needed to assess the possibility of biomass expansion.
