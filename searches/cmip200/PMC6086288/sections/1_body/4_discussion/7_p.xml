<p class="p">Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig" class="xref">12</xref> shows that the maximum GDP losses range from 2 to 12% corresponding to the equilibrium sensitivity values, while the GDP loss in terms of the expected value of LTA in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig" class="xref">12</xref>a is approximately 6%. When we have no learning, as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig" class="xref">12</xref>b, the GDP loss is 10–12%. The maximum GDP loss appears at 3.695 °C equilibrium climate sensitivity in all cases whereas the GDP loss declines as the information is acquired. When we compare the maximum expected GDP loss among the cases, LTA decision-making, single-stage without learning, and ATL learning give 6, 11, and 8.5%, respectively. Because we do not know the “true” equilibrium sensitivity today, it could be said that the GDP in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig" class="xref">12</xref>b is the current appropriate evaluation of GDP loss to maintain a 2 °C target today and that the differences between Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig" class="xref">12</xref>b and c will be eliminated as scientific knowledge is accumulated. It is not easy to compare these numbers to those in the real world. For example, Whitehouse (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">2013</xref>) reports an expenditure of $21.4 billion (current USD) on climate change research, which is 0.1% of GDP. Such a comparison may be meaningless. However, the value of scientific knowledge should not be underestimated.
