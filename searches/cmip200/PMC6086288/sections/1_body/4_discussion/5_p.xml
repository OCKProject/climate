<p class="p">Valuing information should be considered further because we have few existing studies (Manne and Richels 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">1992</xref>). We cannot directly compare our evaluation with existing studies. However, there are many studies that evaluate the GDP loss or costs of climate policies by comparing the differences in GDP with and without a climate policy or focus on the carbon prices. For the former approach, IPCC-AR5-WG3 (IPCC-AR5-WG3 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">2014c</xref>) reports the loss of GDP under various carbon-control scenarios, showing a GDP loss of 1.8–15% (around 5% median) in 2100 in the case of a carbon-equivalent 450-ppmv concentration constraint. We show the trajectories of the rates of GDP loss for our three decision-making cases in Fig.
