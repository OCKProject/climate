  <p class="p">The future fractional decline (% precision) of the Δ
   <italic class="italic">T</italic> uncertainty range estimated in the 2090s relative to the uncertainty range in 14 GCMs. The horizontal axis indicates the update year of the observed data. Within the gray area (up to 2029), the observation data are insufficient for predicting Δ
   <italic class="italic">T</italic> satisfactorily in the 2090s (i.e., the ASK method may fail to accurately constrain Δ
   <italic class="italic">T</italic> in the 2090s). From 2039 onward, we can accurately reduce the Δ
   <italic class="italic">T</italic> uncertainty in the 2090s. The dotted line is the upper limit of precision determined by the internal-climate variability. Beyond this limit, the precision of the ASK method can be improved no further
