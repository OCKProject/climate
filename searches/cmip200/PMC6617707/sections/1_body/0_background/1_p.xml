 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>] predicted that 36–55% of alpine plant species, 31–51% of subalpine plant species, and 19–46% of montane plant species in Europe will lose more than 80% of their suitable habitat by 2070–2100. Sekercioglu et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>] predicted that approximately 30% of land birds will be at worldwide extinction risk by 2100. A study of the northern and southern range limits of British birds showed that the northern range boundaries of 59 species will move 18.9 km northwards on average over a 20-year period [
