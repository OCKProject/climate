 <xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Methods</xref>” for the definition) showed the importance of the variables for the three alpine vegetation communities (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media" class="xref">9</xref>: Figure S4). Distance from the ridge was the most important factor for the area fraction of the 
 <italic class="italic">P. pumila</italic> community, followed by occurrence probability of the alpine vegetation zone and slope direction. Occurrence probability of the alpine vegetation zone was the most important factor for the snowbed grassland community, followed by inclination, slope direction, and curvature. The occurrence probability of the alpine vegetation zone was the most important factor for the fellfield community, followed by TWI, inclination, curvature, and slope direction.
