<p id="Par38" class="p">The indicators of model accuracy for sub-model B1 showed that the model was reasonably accurate (AUC: 0.96 ± 0.001, sensitivity: 0.95, specificity: 0.78, threshold probability for potential habitat: 0.08). The IOV of all the explanatory variables was almost 1.00, which showed that all of the climatic variables were important for the occurrence of the alpine vegetation zone (see Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media" class="xref">7</xref>: Table S3). Response curves of the GAM for sub-model B1 showed that higher warmth index strongly and negatively affected the occurrence of the alpine vegetation zone (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media" class="xref">8</xref>: Figure S3). Summer precipitation higher than ca. 1500 mm had a positive effect on the alpine vegetation zone, whereas summer precipitation lower than ca. 1500 mm had a negative effect. Maximum snowwater higher than ca. 530 mm had a positive effect on the alpine vegetation zone, whereas maximum snowwater lower than ca. 530 mm had a negative effect.
