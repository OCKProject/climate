 <italic class="italic">L. muta japonica</italic> was comparatively similar to the actual distribution of the territories in the study area (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). However, empty habitat (i.e. areas with suitable environmental conditions but no current occurrence of the species) was found in some areas (Fig.
