<p id="Par42" class="p">Potential habitat for the alpine vegetation zone was predicted to decrease from current (ca. 2464 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) to future (ca. 18 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>, representing 0.7% of current in the median of 24 GCMs) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). Area fractions of all the three alpine vegetation communities were predicted to decrease under future climates (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). Future potential habitat for 
 <italic class="italic">L. muta japonica</italic> was projected to decrease to just three grid cells (i.e. 0.4% of current potential habitat) in the median of occurrence probabilities under 24 GCMs, due to a decrease in the area fractions of the alpine vegetation communities (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>a). Most potential habitat for 
 <italic class="italic">L. muta japonica</italic> was predicted to be non-habitat under any future climate scenario, whereas some potential habitat in the central and north-western part of the study area was predicted to be sustained, depending on the GCM (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>b). Environments containing sustainable habitat for 
 <italic class="italic">L. muta japonica</italic> included a climate with cooler temperatures, higher snowfall, and lower summer precipitation, and were located closer to ridges on the leeward (i.e. eastern) side and had a gentler slope in topography.
