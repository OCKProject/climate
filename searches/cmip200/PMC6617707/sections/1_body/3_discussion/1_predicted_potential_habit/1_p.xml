 <italic class="italic">L. muta japonica</italic> under current and future climates at the territory scale (i.e. 300 m × 300 m, 0.09 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) by developing a model that considered the structure of the alpine ecosystem through incorporating spatial hierarchy on various environmental factors. Predicted current potential habitat was consistent with the current observed distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">L. muta japonica</italic> territories, indicating that alpine vegetation communities, such as the 
 <italic class="italic">P. pumila</italic>, snowbed grassland, and fellfield communities, are essential for 
 <italic class="italic">L. muta japonica</italic>. Our findings are quantitatively consistent with previous studies on the ecology of
