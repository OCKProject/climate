<p id="Par47" class="p">Our results showed that in the study area the majority (more than 99%) of potential habitat for 
 <italic class="italic">L. muta japonica</italic> will disappear by 2081–2100, regardless of the uncertainty in GCMs (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). A previous study that assessed the effects of climate change on 
 <italic class="italic">L. muta japonica</italic> showed that 80% of 
 <italic class="italic">L. muta japonica</italic> populations would disappear if the temperature rises by 3 °C [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>]. In the Swiss Alps, Revermann et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>], using several SDMs. predicted a decrease of up to two-thirds in the potential habitat of 
 <italic class="italic">L. m. helvetica</italic> by 2070, and a shift of potential habitat toward the mountain tops. Potential habitats for subspecies of 
 <italic class="italic">L. muta</italic> throughout Europe were predicted to decrease progressively from approximately two million square kilometers at present to approximately one million square kilometers by 2080 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">20</xref>]. In the 2080s, 
 <italic class="italic">L. muta japonica</italic> populations are predicted to decrease even more sharply compared with European populations of 
 <italic class="italic">L. muta</italic>, and thus may represent the 
 <italic class="italic">L. muta</italic> subspecies most vulnerable to global warming. One reason for the high vulnerability of 
 <italic class="italic">L. muta japonica</italic> is that the habitat in Japan is at the southern limit of the global distribution for this species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>]. A second reason is the difference in the altitude inhabited by 
 <italic class="italic">L. muta</italic> species in the Swiss Alps compared to Japan’s northern Alps. The highest altitudinal peak in the study area is 3190 m, whereas the highest altitudinal peak in the Swiss Alps is 4609 m. In Japan, the alpine vegetation used by 
 <italic class="italic">L. muta japonica</italic> already extends to the top and ridges of the mountains, whereas the nival zone, which is covered in snow throughout most of the year at present, occurs above the alpine zone in Europe. Therefore, in future, the alpine vegetation in Japan has little potential habitat above the current habitat range, whereas alpine vegetation in Europe has a larger potential habitat above the current alpine zone. Consequently, the negative influence of future climate change will be larger on 
 <italic class="italic">L. muta</italic> habitats in Japan compared to those in Europe.
