<p id="Par49" class="p">Some uncertainties may still remain regarding prediction of the future potential habitat of 
 <italic class="italic">L. muta japonica</italic>. Plant species have plasticity to environmental change, which may moderate the decreasing speed of alpine plant community distributions. SDMs are based on the hypothesis that relationships between 
 <italic class="italic">L. muta japonica</italic> and alpine plant communities will not change even after climate change (the hypothesis is called niche conservatism [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" class="xref">53</xref>]). Variation among SDMs and greenhouse gas emission scenarios may also be a source of uncertainties regarding future predictions. However, we believe that these uncertainties would probably not change the general trends in our results, although detailed values may be changed.
