<p id="Par51" class="p">Adaptive management, including preventing the invasion of competitive species, assisted breeding, and assisted migration, represents an alternative strategy to reduce the impact of climate change on species and their habitats. Ecological disturbance, such as an increase in competitors, may induce a marked decline in 
 <italic class="italic">L. muta japonica</italic> populations, even in the sustainable habitats of this species. Shifts of terrestrial mammals (e.g., Japanese red fox

 <italic class="italic">Sus scrofa</italic>, Japanese macaque 
 <italic class="italic">Macaca fuscata</italic>, and Asian black bear 
 <italic class="italic">Ursus thibetanus</italic>) into the alpine zone with changing climate may also accelerate the decline of 
 <italic class="italic">L. muta japonica</italic>, due to an increase in predation pressure and competition for alpine plant species as food resources. The protection of chicks has already begun through the use of artificial cages, which reduce high mortality due to heavy rain in the early fledgling period and predation by terrestrial animals [
