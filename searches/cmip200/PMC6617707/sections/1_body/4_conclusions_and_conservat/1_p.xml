<p id="Par50" class="p">We showed that the potential habitats for 
 <italic class="italic">L. muta japonica</italic> would dramatically decrease under different climate change scenarios, although limited potential habitats were predicted to be maintained. These sustainable potential habitats are considered as refugia for the survival of the population under future climatic conditions. Fortunately, all of these areas have already been included in protected areas; however, revision of the management policy, including raising the protection level, restricting human entry to the mountains, and tightening food waste management, are necessary for enhancing the protection of this species within these areas. Moreover, it is also necessary to monitor changes in the size of the 
 <italic class="italic">L. muta japonica</italic> populations in the future. However, an increase in the numbers of predators (e.g., foxes) and grazing ungulates such as deer [

 <italic class="italic">L. muta japonica</italic> numbers before the effects of climate change become apparent.
