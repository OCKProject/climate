<p id="Par34" class="p">We used a GAM to predict the occurrence of the alpine vegetation zone (sub-model B1), which contained the 
 <italic class="italic">P. pumila</italic> community, snowbed grassland community, and alpine fellfield community, at 100-m grid cells (ca. 0.01 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>). Four climatic variables—warmth index [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">32</xref>], minimum temperature, summer precipitation, and maximum snowwater—at 1-km resolution were used as explanatory variables. Warmth index was used as an interaction term with minimum temperature based on the thin plate smoothing spline algorithm [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">43</xref>]. Model accuracy was evaluated by using the AUC together with sensitivity and specificity. Current and future occurrence probabilities of the alpine vegetation zone were predicted by applying the GAM on the current climate and 24 future climate scenarios.
