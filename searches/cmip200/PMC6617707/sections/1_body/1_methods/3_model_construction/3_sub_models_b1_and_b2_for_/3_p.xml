 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">48</xref>] to predict area fractions of alpine vegetation communities (sub-model B2). The package “randomForest” was used for constructing an RF in R. The RF is a model that is based on the machine learning method and has a powerful and high generalizing capability. The model was developed based on the ensemble of numerous classification tree models, by using sub-sampled data from the training data. Area fractions of alpine vegetation communities in each grid cell were used as response variables. As explanatory variables, we used five topographic variables (slope, aspect, curvature, TWI, and distance from the ridgeline) and the occurrence probability of the alpine vegetation zone calculated by sub-model B1. The occurrence probability of the alpine vegetation zone was used as an indicator of climatic suitability for each alpine vegetation community. Correlations between actual and predicted values of area fractions were verified by using Spearman’s rank sum test. The importance of each variable was identified based on increased mean square errors (increased MSE). Increased MSE measures the effect on the predictive power when the value of a specific original variable is randomly permuted [
