<p id="Par24" class="p">In the study area, the 
 <italic class="italic">L. muta japonica</italic> population size was estimated at 352–376 territories and 860–920 birds, based on the results of intermittent surveys from 1971 to 2010 (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Appendix S1). By way of comparison, the total number of 
 <italic class="italic">L. muta japonica</italic> in the 1980s was approximately 3000 birds [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>]. In this analysis, we used the distribution of territories as occurrence data of 
 <italic class="italic">L. muta japonica</italic>. In Japan, 
 <italic class="italic">L. muta japonica</italic> lives in the alpine zone of the mountains above 2200 m. The mean territory size of cocks (males) during the breeding season ranges from 0.015 to 0.072 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">30</xref>]. On the basis of this information, we defined the grid cell size for projection of the potential habitat as 300 m (0.09 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>). Grid cells that did not overlap with the territories were defined as absence.
