<p id="Par28" class="p">We constructed topographic data based on a 10-m-resolution digital elevation model that was supplied by the Geospatial Information Authority of Japan by using the System for Automated Geoscientific Analyses (SAGA, URL:

The topographic data were constructed at 100-m resolution, which was assumed appropriate for estimating the fraction of the areas for alpine vegetation. Five topographic factors, which are thought to be important for plant growth, were calculated, namely, inclination, slope direction, curvature, topographic wetness index (TWI) [
