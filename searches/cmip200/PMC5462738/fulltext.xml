Here, the natural and external forcings (e.g., natural and anthropogenic) responsible for ST variability are studied from Coupled Model Inter-comparison phase 5 (CMIP5) models during the 20<sup>th</sup> century and projections during the 21<sup>st</sup> century along with seasonal variability. Greenhouse Gases (GHG) and Land Use (LU) are the major factors that gave rise to warming during the 20<sup>th</sup> century. Anthropogenic Aerosols (AA) have slowed down the warming rate. The CMIP5 projection over India shows a sharp increase in ST under Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 8.5 where it reaches a maximum of 5&#x02009;K by the end of the 21<sup>st</sup> century. Under RCP2.6 emission scenarios, ST increases up to the year 2050 and decreases afterwards. The seasonal variability of ST during the 21<sup>st</sup> century shows significant increase during summer. Analysis of rare heat and cold events for 2080&#x02013;2099 relative to a base period of 1986&#x02013;2006 under RCP8.5 scenarios reveals that both are likely to increase substantially.

The recent report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> showed the anthropogenic footprint on the global warming of atmosphere and oceans, reduction in snow and ice, and increase in sea level. Climate change and variability comprise complex interactions between natural and external forcings at different temporal and spatial scales. However, quantifying the contribution of each component in the overall observed climate signal is very challenging. Climate models represent important tools to investigate the historical climate change due to anthropogenic forcings. With these models and controlled simulations, it is possible to decompose the contributions from individual factors or assess their combined effects on regional or global climate. This allows exploring the possible causes and understanding the physical mechanisms behind climate change and variability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.</p><p>The World Climate Research Program (WCRP) has supported the development of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP), which provides simulation from state-of-the-art global climate models. CMIP model simulations have been used in the Assessment Reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (e.g., IPCC AR4 and AR5). The CMIP5 simulations include both historic (20<sup>th</sup> century) and future projections (21<sup>st</sup> century) under different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. The RCPs represent different mitigation scenarios that influence the future emissions of greenhouse gasses, aerosols, ozone and land use change. The CMIP5 experiment simulates historical changes in temperature with forcings driven by Anthropogenic Aerosols (AA), Greenhouse Gases (GHGs), Land Use change (LU), Natural (NAT) forces (Solar Irradiance&#x02009;+&#x02009;Volcanic Activity), and Solar radiation (SL)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Comparing these forcings with each other provides a better understanding of the contributors to climate change over a particular region or location<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p>India is one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. The annual ST has increased since the 1950&#x02019;s, particularly over India. Although, previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> have shown a clear increasing trend in mean, minimum, and maximum temperatures over India during the last century, the contributing factors to this have not been explored in detail. The observed climate change in India is due to the complex interactions between natural and anthropogenic forcings at different temporal and spatial scales. However, it is not well understood to what extent climate change in India during the past century, particularly the past several decades, can be attributed to human and natural forcings. In this study, we have utilized the CMIP5 simulation from the years 1860&#x02013;2100 along with ground-based observational data sets (Climate Research Unit, CRU and India Meteorological Department, IMD gridded temperature) to quantify the historical (Natural&#x02009;+&#x02009;Anthropogenic), NAT, and external forcings (AA, GHGs, LU and SL) in the observed warming over India. We evaluate the 17 CMIP5 historical ST data with observational data sets along with future projections. We investigate the contribution of different natural and anthropogenic forcings in the observed and expected future warming. We also evaluate trends in different simulations during different periods between the years 2006&#x02013;2100. In addition, we discuss changes in ST extremes over India.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Evaluation of CMIP5 ST with CRU and IMD</title><p>The ST simulation from the individual CMIP5 model is evaluated against the CRU and IMD data sets as shown in Figures&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>, respectively. These simulations are compared for different periods: 1901&#x02013;2005 (against CRU data) and 1969&#x02013;2005 (against IMD data). From both figures, it is clear that the North Eastern part and Himalayan regions show a large bias for all models, possibly due to complexities in higher elevations also mentioned in other studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Further, the overall bias is even larger when CIMP5 simulations are compared with IMD relative to the CRU data set, mainly on the western coast of India. The models CSIRO-Mk3-6-0, GISS-E2-H, GISS-E2-R, HadGEM2-CC, HadGEM2-ES, MIRCO-ESM, MRI-CGCM3, and inmcm4 show larger biases compared to other models.</p><p>For further evaluation, we show the Taylor diagrams for representing the simulated mean STs relative to CRU (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>) and IMD (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). The former covers 1901&#x02013;2005, whereas the latter covers 1969&#x02013;2005 over India. In these figures, the solid lines correspond to standard deviations, while the dotted lines represent the correlations between simulations and observations. As shown, the correlation between 8 CMIP5 models (CCSM4, CSIRO-Mk3-6-0, GISS-E2-H, GISS-E2-R, HadGEM2-CC, HadGEM2-ES, GFDL-CM3, and MICRO-ESM) with CRU and IMD data sets is less than 0.5. To continue the analysis, we have discarded these models, and considered the ones that show high correlations (i.e., CNRM-CM5, CanESM2, GFDL-CM3, IPSL-CM5A-LR, MIRCOC5, MPI-ESM-LR, NorESM1-M, and bcc-csm1-1). The Taylor diagram presents the spread of the models in terms of their spatial correlation. The correlations between models and the two observational data sets are quite similar (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a and b</xref>). The highest correlation score of about of 0.78 is observed for MIROC5 and IPSL-CM5-AL.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Taylor diagram for mean surface temperature between CRU and CMIP5 individual model during the period 1901&#x02013;2005 (<bold>a</bold>), IMD and CMIP5 individual model for the years 1969&#x02013;2005 (<bold>b</bold>) over India.

</p><p>The climatological mean biases between CMIP5 simulations and the two observational data sets (i.e., IMD, CR) are shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. Note that this bias and trends are estimated for the period of 1969&#x02013;2005 when the two observational datasets overlap. The mean bias between IMD and CRU is less than &#x000b1;1&#x02009;K, as shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>, except for the Northeastern part and the Himalayan regions. The climatological bias between IMD and the ensemble mean of the selected 8 CMIP5 models is shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>. The bias over India varies around &#x000b1;1&#x02009;K, except over the Northeastern and Himalayan regions where the bias exceeds 4&#x02009;K. Similar bias is observed between CRU and CMIP5 models. Higher bias in the Northeastern and Himalayan regions may be due to the fact that there are few observations available in these regions. In addition, we computed the spatial trends based on the historical climate model simulations and observations (IMD, CRU) - see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2(d&#x02013;f)</xref>. In Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2(d&#x02013;f)</xref>, the solid black mark indicates the 95% confidence level, as determined at each individual grid point and was computed by using student&#x02019;s t-test. Over India, there is a warming trend at the rate of ~0.2&#x02009;K/decade from the year 1969&#x02013;2005. Few parts (Northeastern and Himalayan regions) of India exhibit decreasing trends in IMD data (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). Recent studies also indicate relatively suppressed warming over India, with some cooling over the central regions, during the past century<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. This feature is not shown in the CRU data and CMIP5 simulations. The central part of India shows the highest warming compared to other regions as shown by both CRU and CMIP5 simulations (~0.36&#x02009;K/decade). Overall, there are discrepancies in the warming trends. However, CRU observations and CMIP5 simulations seem to be more consistent with one another compared to IMD data.

The forcing responses are computed and compared with the observed ST based on ground-based data. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> show temporal variation of mean ST over India from CRU, and historical simulation (GHG, NAT, AA, LU, and SL forcings) data. These temporal variations are calculated as the mean of all years over India (using data from Jan. 1860 to Dec. 2005) subtracted from the yearly ST values of each simulation. In each panel, the ensemble bounds (maximum and minimum values) are shown in shaded color. The results of the robust regression fitting, along with CRU ST are shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> for each forcing. The increase in temperature due to GHGs forcing from 1900 onwards is clearly observed in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>. The turning point (changing from negative to positive temperature anomaly) in the yearly time series of ST variation matches very well with the historical ensemble mean of the different forcings. The observed CRU ST is superimposed on the ensemble of historical model simulations (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). Both historical simulations and CRU ST show similar variability throughout the 20<sup>th</sup> century (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). Except for NAT, SL and AA, all other forcings show a remarkable increase in ST, some even higher than the observations (e.g., 3c and 3d). This shows that considering LU and GHG alone leads to an overestimation of the surface temperature warming in the historical period. However, increase in ST from the combination of all forcings closely follows the observed historical temperatures. The warming due to GHG shows a sharp increase after1960 over India, which is very much consistent with LU forcings. The combination of both direct and indirect AA forcings depicts the significant decreasing from 1960 onwards. The impacts of NAT and SL forcings on warming in ST are comparatively much smaller than those from GHG, and LU. These simulations with individual forcings are useful to compare the role of different forcings. Individually, they are not expected to reproduce historical observations. However, we have included the historical observations as a common reference for evaluation. Overall, the results show that AA, NAT and SL provided cooling effect and slow the warming rate, while the other forcings (GHG and LU) contributed significantly to the observed warming. The results show that AA has negative contribution to the warming when we considered both the direct and indirect forcings. When direct forcings alone is consider, there is a weak cooling trend. However, with both direct and indirect AA the cooling trend becomes highly significant. Under GHG forcings, only the warming trend of 0.16&#x02009;K/decade is observed which is very strong compared to all other forcings. The seasonal variations of different forcings are depicted in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The largest seasonal variations in GHG and LU are observed during winter followed by summer, fall and spring. GHG variability is larger during winter and summer compared to the other seasons. The observed increasing trend is larger for GHG compared to LU. In case of AA forcings, the seasonal variation of decreasing trend is large during fall and minimum during summer. A small positive trend is noticed from NAT forcing in all the seasons. The SL radiation shows a significant negative trend, except during the fall season.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Temporal variation of annual surface temperature anomalies during the years 1860&#x02013;2005. &#x02018;All&#x02019; indicates the historical forcing, which contains all types of forcings.

The correlation values are presented in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>. The observed ST from CRU shows good correlation with GHG forcings while historic data shows a very high correlation with GHG and LU. A negative correlation is detected between AA and SL with observed data. GHG emissions contributed to a warming of about 0.106&#x02009;K/decade over the period 1860 to 2005 whereas the contributions LU to the warming trend are around 0.073&#x02009;K/decade. The contribution from natural forcings is about 0.006&#x02009;K/decade, very much less than external forcings. Solar radiation shows a negative trend, which means a cooling effect on ST. The contribution of natural and external forcings contributed to a mean surface warming of about 0.055&#x02009;K/decade. It is extremely likely that more than half of the observed increase in average ST from 1950 onwards was caused by external forcings.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Future projections</title><p>For projecting climate change impacts on ST during the 21<sup>st</sup> century, we considered low and high RCPs (i.e., RCP2.6 and RCP8.5) emission scenarios.

RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 show around 3.2 degrees temperature difference by the end of the century. During the last century, the change in surface temperature is well captured by all data sets. Temperature projections show consistent increasing trends in RCP8.5 whereas the projected mean temperature from RCP2.6 increases up to 2050, and then slightly decreases, consistent with the radiative forcing under RCP2.6.

</p><p>Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref> illustrates the spatial pattern of ST trends over India during the 21<sup>st</sup> century under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 emission scenarios. The ST trends were estimated for different periods such as near future (2006&#x02013;2035), mid-future (2046&#x02013;2065), and far future (2080&#x02013;2099) as well as for the entire time series of model simulations (2006&#x02013;2099). Under RCP2.6, the temperature increases in near future and decreases in both mid- and far-future, but the entire time series shows an overall increase in ST of about ~0.15&#x02009;K/decade. The far-future projections show cooling all over India except for southern India (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7c</xref>). Continuous increases in ST are expected in near, mid-, and far future under the RCP8.5 scenario. Significantly, higher temperatures are expected in the late 21<sup>st</sup> century compared to near and middle future temperatures. The long-term (2006&#x02013;2099) trends show warming of about 0.2&#x02009;K/decade over India.

</p><p>We have also analyzed the seasonal variations of ST trends over India from RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 as shown in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref> for different time periods. In the near future, under RCP2.6 the temperature increases sharply and is highest during the summer season, while ST decreases in mid- and far-future. Under RCP8.5, the ST increases during all periods. The far-future ST trend increases drastically (nearly 3 times the near and mid-future trends).

Based on the CMIP5 multi-model simulations, the relative contribution of external forcings such as natural (solar radiation, volcanic emissions) and human activities (GHGs, AA, and LU) to the observed ST during the last 100 years were computed. In addition, we have also considered the individual and combined effects of direct and indirect AA forcings. The evaluation of CMIP5 historic data with observational data sets and future projections during the 21<sup>st</sup> century under different RCP scenarios is also presented. The long-term trends were estimated by using robust regression analysis.

</p><p>GHGs (water vapor, CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O) act to make the surface warmer by absorbing and emitting heat energy in all the directions. Addition of more GHGs to the atmosphere make more effective in preventing the heat from escaping into space. The GHG&#x02019;s concentration increased significantly since the industrial revolution began. The atmospheric concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O has increased by 40%, 150% and 20%, respectively. This increase in GHGs is due to emissions by human activities, which alter the Earth&#x02019;s energy balance resulting in significant increase in ST thus global warming. The anthropogenic forcings plays a significant role in climate change hence global warming. Humans alter aerosols not only at the surface (e.g. industrial emissions) but also at the higher altitudes. Due to increase in populations, the natural vegetation decreases for thousands of years by deforestation. The largest changes occurred in 20<sup>th</sup> century. Hence changing land cover affects the climate by modifying the surface reflectivity and the hydrological cycle. In addition to the direct radiative effects, LU can affect the sources and sinks of GHG&#x02019;s and the amount of dust lifted into the atmosphere by the wind. For example, atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, and N<sub>2</sub>O concentrations are increased by deforestation, cultivation of rice and by use of nitrogen fertilizers in agriculture activity. Natural variability of aerosols, particularly due to volcanoes eruptions (e.g. Mt. Pinatubo in 1991) are recognized as a significant climate change indication, which alters the Earth&#x02019;s radiation balance and thus tends to cause the increase in temperature. These and other lines of evidence point conclusively to the fact that the elevated CO<sub>2</sub> concentration in our atmosphere is the result of human activities. It is well known that net global warming is very sensitive to the region of focus. Different local and regional topographical and meteorological factors play an important role in determining global warming and climate change. India will observe changes in precipitation, cyclone occurrence, human health, agriculture, extreme events<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Although a sudden increase in ST was observed during the last century, the annual precipitation over India showed only moderate increase. However, the extreme precipitation frequency and magnitude increased rapidly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, newly introduced forcing agents such as historical emissions of carbonaceous aerosols should be included in future studies for a better understanding of global warming impacts. Uncertainties related to future warming in model analysis also need further investigation. CMIP5 coordinated climate models experiments had leads to better understanding of past, present, and future climate change and variability. However, the science gaps and outstanding questions have promoted to design new experiments known as CMIP6, which address the science aspects such as Earth system respond to forcings, sources and consequences of systematic biases and assessment of future climate changes given climate variability, predictability and uncertainties in scenarios. In recent years, the asymmetry of the forcing has been noticed and attracted more and more attention of scientists. For example, the asymmetric volcanic eruptions at different latitudes can affect the global climate differently<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. In CMIP6, the latitude-dependent GHG concentration will also considered, that should have different effect on the Indian surface temperature compared to CMIP5.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Data and Methodology</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Historical and Future projections from CMIP5 models</title><p>In this article, we have analyzed 109 simulations from 17 CMIP5 models, which include different emission scenarios, and historical simulations as shown in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>.
