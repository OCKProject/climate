  <p class="p">Temporal variation of annual surface temperature anomalies during the years 1860–2005. ‘All’ indicates the historical forcing, which contains all types of forcings. Individual forcings include Anthropogenic Aerosol (AA), Greenhouse Gases (GHG), Land Use change (LU), Natural forcings (solar radiation + volcanic eruptions), and Solar radiation (SL). In each forcing the observed CRU temperature data is also plotted for the years 1901–2005. Robust regression analysis was performed at the 95% confidence level for trend analysis which is over plotted in each panel (Figure was created using the Interactive Data Language (IDL) version 8.2 software
