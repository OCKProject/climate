 </sup> showed the anthropogenic footprint on the global warming of atmosphere and oceans, reduction in snow and ice, and increase in sea level. Climate change and variability comprise complex interactions between natural and external forcings at different temporal and spatial scales. However, quantifying the contribution of each component in the overall observed climate signal is very challenging. Climate models represent important tools to investigate the historical climate change due to anthropogenic forcings. With these models and controlled simulations, it is possible to decompose the contributions from individual factors or assess their combined effects on regional or global climate. This allows exploring the possible causes and understanding the physical mechanisms behind climate change and variability
