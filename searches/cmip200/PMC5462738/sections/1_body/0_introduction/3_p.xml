 </sup> have shown a clear increasing trend in mean, minimum, and maximum temperatures over India during the last century, the contributing factors to this have not been explored in detail. The observed climate change in India is due to the complex interactions between natural and anthropogenic forcings at different temporal and spatial scales. However, it is not well understood to what extent climate change in India during the past century, particularly the past several decades, can be attributed to human and natural forcings. In this study, we have utilized the CMIP5 simulation from the years 1860–2100 along with ground-based observational data sets (Climate Research Unit, CRU and India Meteorological Department, IMD gridded temperature) to quantify the historical (Natural + Anthropogenic), NAT, and external forcings (AA, GHGs, LU and SL) in the observed warming over India. We evaluate the 17 CMIP5 historical ST data with observational data sets along with future projections. We investigate the contribution of different natural and anthropogenic forcings in the observed and expected future warming. We also evaluate trends in different simulations during different periods between the years 2006–2100. In addition, we discuss changes in ST extremes over India.
