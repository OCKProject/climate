<p class="p">The World Climate Research Program (WCRP) has supported the development of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP), which provides simulation from state-of-the-art global climate models. CMIP model simulations have been used in the Assessment Reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (e.g., IPCC AR4 and AR5). The CMIP5 simulations include both historic (20
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> century) and future projections (21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century) under different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs)

 </sup>. The RCPs represent different mitigation scenarios that influence the future emissions of greenhouse gasses, aerosols, ozone and land use change. The CMIP5 experiment simulates historical changes in temperature with forcings driven by Anthropogenic Aerosols (AA), Greenhouse Gases (GHGs), Land Use change (LU), Natural (NAT) forces (Solar Irradiance + Volcanic Activity), and Solar radiation (SL)
