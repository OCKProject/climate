<p class="p">Sensitivity experiments, such as correlation analysis with all forcings, are also performed in the present work. The correlation values are presented in Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>. The observed ST from CRU shows good correlation with GHG forcings while historic data shows a very high correlation with GHG and LU. A negative correlation is detected between AA and SL with observed data. GHG emissions contributed to a warming of about 0.106 K/decade over the period 1860 to 2005 whereas the contributions LU to the warming trend are around 0.073 K/decade. The contribution from natural forcings is about 0.006 K/decade, very much less than external forcings. Solar radiation shows a negative trend, which means a cooling effect on ST. The contribution of natural and external forcings contributed to a mean surface warming of about 0.055 K/decade. It is extremely likely that more than half of the observed increase in average ST from 1950 onwards was caused by external forcings.
