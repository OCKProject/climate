<p class="p">The spatial distribution of ST trends over India is estimated using 146 years of simulations (1860–2005) with different forcings (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). Here, the ST trends are computed at each grid point using the robust regression technique

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">12</xref>
 </sup>. In this process, we have tested the statistical significance at each grid cell and only considered trends that are significant at the 0.05 significance level (95% confidence) marked with ‘x’ symbol. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5a</xref> shows the warming response over India at a 0.18 K/decade rate based on all forcings. The NAT forcings show a slight warming trend over central India and cooling trends in other parts, which, as expected, is not consistent with the observations. The response of GHGs and LU forcing is very large and a warming trend is observed throughout the region. The warming (cooling) rate response to GHG (AA) forcing in North India is large compared to the South India (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5b and c</xref>).
