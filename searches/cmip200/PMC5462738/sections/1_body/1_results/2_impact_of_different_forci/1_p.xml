<p class="p">The ensemble means of different historical forcings for the 19
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> and 20
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> centuries (shown in Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>) are plotted in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>. The forcing responses are computed and compared with the observed ST based on ground-based data. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> show temporal variation of mean ST over India from CRU, and historical simulation (GHG, NAT, AA, LU, and SL forcings) data. These temporal variations are calculated as the mean of all years over India (using data from Jan. 1860 to Dec. 2005) subtracted from the yearly ST values of each simulation. In each panel, the ensemble bounds (maximum and minimum values) are shown in shaded color. The results of the robust regression fitting, along with CRU ST are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> for each forcing. The increase in temperature due to GHGs forcing from 1900 onwards is clearly observed in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b</xref>. The turning point (changing from negative to positive temperature anomaly) in the yearly time series of ST variation matches very well with the historical ensemble mean of the different forcings. The observed CRU ST is superimposed on the ensemble of historical model simulations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a</xref>). Both historical simulations and CRU ST show similar variability throughout the 20
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> century (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a</xref>). Except for NAT, SL and AA, all other forcings show a remarkable increase in ST, some even higher than the observations (e.g., 3c and 3d). This shows that considering LU and GHG alone leads to an overestimation of the surface temperature warming in the historical period. However, increase in ST from the combination of all forcings closely follows the observed historical temperatures. The warming due to GHG shows a sharp increase after1960 over India, which is very much consistent with LU forcings. The combination of both direct and indirect AA forcings depicts the significant decreasing from 1960 onwards. The impacts of NAT and SL forcings on warming in ST are comparatively much smaller than those from GHG, and LU. These simulations with individual forcings are useful to compare the role of different forcings. Individually, they are not expected to reproduce historical observations. However, we have included the historical observations as a common reference for evaluation. Overall, the results show that AA, NAT and SL provided cooling effect and slow the warming rate, while the other forcings (GHG and LU) contributed significantly to the observed warming. The results show that AA has negative contribution to the warming when we considered both the direct and indirect forcings. When direct forcings alone is consider, there is a weak cooling trend. However, with both direct and indirect AA the cooling trend becomes highly significant. Under GHG forcings, only the warming trend of 0.16 K/decade is observed which is very strong compared to all other forcings. The seasonal variations of different forcings are depicted in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>. The largest seasonal variations in GHG and LU are observed during winter followed by summer, fall and spring. GHG variability is larger during winter and summer compared to the other seasons. The observed increasing trend is larger for GHG compared to LU. In case of AA forcings, the seasonal variation of decreasing trend is large during fall and minimum during summer. A small positive trend is noticed from NAT forcing in all the seasons. The SL radiation shows a significant negative trend, except during the fall season.
