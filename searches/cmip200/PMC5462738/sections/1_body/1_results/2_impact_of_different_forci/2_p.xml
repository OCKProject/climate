 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> shows the box and whisker plot along with probability density functions of ST from different forcings relative to the base period of 1910–1940. The boxes indicate the interquartile model spread (i.e., 25
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> and 75
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> quartiles). The 75
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> quartile of the GHG forcing is highest among others and reaches 298.2 K. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> shows that the difference between GHG and NAT forcings is around ~3 K, which suggests the role of GHG alone relative to the natural variability. The highest ST values are found in GHGs followed by LU, AA, SL and NAT, respectively. The probability density functions of the historical temperature anomalies (relative to the period 1910–1940) show clear warming shifts of about ~0.15 K in GHGs, followed by LU. The AA forcings shows the negative shift in the probability distribution. The distributions of the remaining forcings fall between 0–0.2 K temperature changes in the historical period
