<p class="p">For projecting climate change impacts on ST during the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century, we considered low and high RCPs (i.e., RCP2.6 and RCP8.5) emission scenarios. The evolution of ST changes relative to 1901–1960 over India from IMD, CRU, historic simulations, and ensemble mean of 8 CMIP5 simulations are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>. RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 show around 3.2 degrees temperature difference by the end of the century. During the last century, the change in surface temperature is well captured by all data sets. Temperature projections show consistent increasing trends in RCP8.5 whereas the projected mean temperature from RCP2.6 increases up to 2050, and then slightly decreases, consistent with the radiative forcing under RCP2.6. The mean temperature over India is expected to increase over the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century under all the RCPs. Around the middle of 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century, the rate of warming increases sharply depending on the scenario (e.g., RCP 8.5). On average, the projected change in temperature by the end of the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century relative to 1901–1960 is expected to be 1.8 K, 2 K, 3.5 K, and 5 K for RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 emission scenarios, respectively.
