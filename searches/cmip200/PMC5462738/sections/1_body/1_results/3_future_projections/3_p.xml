<p class="p">We have also analyzed the seasonal variations of ST trends over India from RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 as shown in Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref> for different time periods. In the near future, under RCP2.6 the temperature increases sharply and is highest during the summer season, while ST decreases in mid- and far-future. Under RCP8.5, the ST increases during all periods. The far-future ST trend increases drastically (nearly 3 times the near and mid-future trends). The winter ST shows significant increase followed by spring over India. The entire time series indicates that ST can increase by ~4.5 K by the end of the 21
