<p class="p">Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref> illustrates the spatial pattern of ST trends over India during the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 emission scenarios. The ST trends were estimated for different periods such as near future (2006–2035), mid-future (2046–2065), and far future (2080–2099) as well as for the entire time series of model simulations (2006–2099). Under RCP2.6, the temperature increases in near future and decreases in both mid- and far-future, but the entire time series shows an overall increase in ST of about ~0.15 K/decade. The far-future projections show cooling all over India except for southern India (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7c</xref>). Continuous increases in ST are expected in near, mid-, and far future under the RCP8.5 scenario. Significantly, higher temperatures are expected in the late 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century compared to near and middle future temperatures. The long-term (2006–2099) trends show warming of about 0.2 K/decade over India. In addition, the warming increases rapidly toward the end of the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century, reaching a peak value of about 0.4 K/decade.
