<p class="p">The ST simulation from the individual CMIP5 model is evaluated against the CRU and IMD data sets as shown in Figures 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>, respectively. These simulations are compared for different periods: 1901–2005 (against CRU data) and 1969–2005 (against IMD data). From both figures, it is clear that the North Eastern part and Himalayan regions show a large bias for all models, possibly due to complexities in higher elevations also mentioned in other studies

 </sup>. Further, the overall bias is even larger when CIMP5 simulations are compared with IMD relative to the CRU data set, mainly on the western coast of India. The models CSIRO-Mk3-6-0, GISS-E2-H, GISS-E2-R, HadGEM2-CC, HadGEM2-ES, MIRCO-ESM, MRI-CGCM3, and inmcm4 show larger biases compared to other models.
