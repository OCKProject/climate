<p class="p">For further evaluation, we show the Taylor diagrams for representing the simulated mean STs relative to CRU (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref>) and IMD (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b</xref>). The former covers 1901–2005, whereas the latter covers 1969–2005 over India. In these figures, the solid lines correspond to standard deviations, while the dotted lines represent the correlations between simulations and observations. As shown, the correlation between 8 CMIP5 models (CCSM4, CSIRO-Mk3-6-0, GISS-E2-H, GISS-E2-R, HadGEM2-CC, HadGEM2-ES, GFDL-CM3, and MICRO-ESM) with CRU and IMD data sets is less than 0.5. To continue the analysis, we have discarded these models, and considered the ones that show high correlations (i.e., CNRM-CM5, CanESM2, GFDL-CM3, IPSL-CM5A-LR, MIRCOC5, MPI-ESM-LR, NorESM1-M, and bcc-csm1-1). The Taylor diagram presents the spread of the models in terms of their spatial correlation. The correlations between models and the two observational data sets are quite similar (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a and b</xref>). The highest correlation score of about of 0.78 is observed for MIROC5 and IPSL-CM5-AL.
