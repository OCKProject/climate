<p class="p">The climatological mean biases between CMIP5 simulations and the two observational data sets (i.e., IMD, CR) are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>. Note that this bias and trends are estimated for the period of 1969–2005 when the two observational datasets overlap. The mean bias between IMD and CRU is less than ±1 K, as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref>, except for the Northeastern part and the Himalayan regions. The climatological bias between IMD and the ensemble mean of the selected 8 CMIP5 models is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b</xref>. The bias over India varies around ±1 K, except over the Northeastern and Himalayan regions where the bias exceeds 4 K. Similar bias is observed between CRU and CMIP5 models. Higher bias in the Northeastern and Himalayan regions may be due to the fact that there are few observations available in these regions. In addition, we computed the spatial trends based on the historical climate model simulations and observations (IMD, CRU) - see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2(d–f)</xref>. In Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2(d–f)</xref>, the solid black mark indicates the 95% confidence level, as determined at each individual grid point and was computed by using student’s t-test. Over India, there is a warming trend at the rate of ~0.2 K/decade from the year 1969–2005. Few parts (Northeastern and Himalayan regions) of India exhibit decreasing trends in IMD data (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2d</xref>). Recent studies also indicate relatively suppressed warming over India, with some cooling over the central regions, during the past century

 </sup>. This feature is not shown in the CRU data and CMIP5 simulations. The central part of India shows the highest warming compared to other regions as shown by both CRU and CMIP5 simulations (~0.36 K/decade). Overall, there are discrepancies in the warming trends. However, CRU observations and CMIP5 simulations seem to be more consistent with one another compared to IMD data. We have also performed the seasonal trend analysis in ST over India as shown in Table
