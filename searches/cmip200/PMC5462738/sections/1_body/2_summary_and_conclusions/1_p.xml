<p class="p">The surface temperature (ST) changes over India are studied by using 109 simulations from global coupled climate models with different external forcings during the 20
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> and future projections under different RCP emission scenarios in the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century. Based on the CMIP5 multi-model simulations, the relative contribution of external forcings such as natural (solar radiation, volcanic emissions) and human activities (GHGs, AA, and LU) to the observed ST during the last 100 years were computed. In addition, we have also considered the individual and combined effects of direct and indirect AA forcings. The evaluation of CMIP5 historic data with observational data sets and future projections during the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century under different RCP scenarios is also presented. The long-term trends were estimated by using robust regression analysis. The main findings of the present study are summarized below:

   <p class="p">During the 20
    <sup class="sup">th</sup> century, the major contributors for the increase in ST are GHGs and LU over India whereas the AA has slowed the warming rate over India. The NAT and SL forcings shows slight negative warming trend. The warming rate from GHGs and Lu are estimated to be 0.14 ± 0.53 and 0.06 ± 0.2 K/century, respectively.

   <p class="p">Human activities are highly responsible for the increase in warming over India. The warming is predominantly attributed to GHGs followed by LU. A sharp increase in warming is noticed from the 1960s onward from GHGs, whereas for LU the increase is observed from 1980

   <p class="p">The trends estimated during the 20
    <sup class="sup">th</sup> century show highest warming in historic data followed by CRU and IMD data. The central part of India warmed severely compared to other regions. The observed warming is more pronounced during the summer followed by winter, monsoon season, and post-monsoon.

   <p class="p">The multi-model mean of CMIP5 captures the basic features of observed ST. The future protections under different RCP emission scenarios are very distinct. Rapid increase in warming is noticed under RCP8.5 where it reaches a maximum temperature of ~5 K by the end of the 21
    <sup class="sup">st</sup> century. In RCP2.6 emission scenarios the warming increases until 2050 and decreases afterwards.

   <p class="p">Future warming is larger during the winter season followed by summer, monsoon and post-monsoon seasons over India. By the end of the 21
