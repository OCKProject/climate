<p class="p">The India Meteorological Department (IMD) developed gridded ST data at 1° × 1° resolution
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>
 </sup>. The observed data from 395 stations were selected for the development of gridded data. The observed data was subjected to quality checks such as rejecting values, which exceed known extreme levels, maximum temperature less than minimum temperature, same temperature values for many consecutive days etc. The 395 station data were interpolated into grids with the modified version of Shepard angular distance weighting algorithm
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">28</xref>
 </sup>. The data period spans between the years 1969–2005 and it is cross validated by estimating the root mean square error. The errors associated with the interpolation scheme were used in preparing gridded data over the plains, which was found to be 0.5 °C at the maximum.
