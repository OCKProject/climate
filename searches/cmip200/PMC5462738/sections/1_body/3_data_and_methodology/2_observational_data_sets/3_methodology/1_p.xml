<p class="p">The ST data from different forcings and all the CMIP5 model data sets under various RCPs are brought to a common grid of 1° × 1° longitude and latitude by using cubic spline interpolation. For trend estimation, the robust regression technique is used. This method is an important tool for analyzing the data affected by outliers and it is based on Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares Regression (IRLS)

 </sup>. The t-test analysis is employed to calculate the statistical significance of the temperature trends. In this process, we have estimated the confidence level at each trend grid point and only those spectral peaks with greater than 95% confidence level are considered.
