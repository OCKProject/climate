<p class="p">In this article, we have analyzed 109 simulations from 17 CMIP5 models, which include different emission scenarios, and historical simulations as shown in Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>. Note that not all CMIP5 models simulate all the forcings. 17 CMIP5 models under different RCP 2.6, 4.5, 6.5, 8.5 emission scenarios are used along with NAT forcings from 12 simulations, GHGs forcings from 15 simulations, AA forcings from 5 simulations, LU forcings from 5 simulations and SL forcings from 4 simulations. The period 1860–2005, which is designated as the historic period, has been chosen for coordinated climate model experiments under CMIP5

 </sup>. In this simulation, varying atmospheric composition (e.g., CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) resulting from solar forcing, anthropogenic, volcanic, emissions of short-lived species and natural and anthropogenic aerosols are forced to reproduce the historical climate. These experiments are part of the CMIP5 coordinated experiments, used in the fifth Assessment Report by IPCC

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>). The RCP4.5 corresponds to radiative forcing of 4.5 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> after the year 2100, which means that the CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions may exceed 650 ppm. Similarly, the RCP8.5 corresponds to 8.5 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> after the year 2100, which means that the equivalent CO
