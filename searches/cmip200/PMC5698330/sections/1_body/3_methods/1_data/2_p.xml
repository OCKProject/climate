<p id="Par19" class="p">The CMIP5 ESMs provide carbon-flux variables between land and atmosphere related to land processes such as terrestrial production and respiration. In this study, carbon fluxes are defined as the amount of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> transported from land to the atmosphere; thus, a negative value means that land emits CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> into the atmosphere and a positive value implies that land removes CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> from the atmosphere.
