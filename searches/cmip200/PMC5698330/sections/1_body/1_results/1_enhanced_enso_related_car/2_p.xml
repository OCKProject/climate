<p id="Par7" class="p">The NBP carbon flux is defined as the sum of carbon fluxes due to gross primary production (total biomass produced by photosynthesis; GPP), autotrophic respiration R
 <sub class="sub">a</sub>, heterotrophic respiration R
 <sub class="sub">h</sub>, and emissions from wildfires in the CMIP5 ESMs. The sensitivity of carbon fluxes to ENSO is estimated from the separate responses of each carbon flux. The GPP response to ENSO,

 <sub class="sub">a</sub> and R
 <sub class="sub">h</sub>, are relatively small for both the experiments and for the differences between the two experiments (see Supplementary Fig.

 </sup>. Although this MME result is about 20% of GPP anomalies in SONDJF, it is based on only four models: CESM1-CAM5, IPSL-CM5A-MR, MPI-ESM-LR, and NORESM1-M, which simulate carbon flux due to wildfires. Because other models do not include carbon-emission anomalies due to fire, the CMIP5 ESMs tend to underestimate the contribution of fires to NBP anomalies. Nonetheless, the individual ESMs and the MME mostly exhibit similar magnitudes, evolutions, and peak timings in the GPP response to ENSO as compared with the NBP response to ENSO (see Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref>). Thus, the carbon fluxes according to GPP anomalies in the range 40 °S–40 °N mainly lead to terrestrial carbon-flux anomalies associated with ENSO in the ESMs.
