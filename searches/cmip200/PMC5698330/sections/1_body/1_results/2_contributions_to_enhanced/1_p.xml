 </sup>, the GPP response to ENSO is separated into the contributions of local temperature and precipitation to understand how the ENSO-related carbon cycle intensifies under greenhouse warming. The future changes in the GPP response to ENSO are determined by changes in the response of local temperature and precipitation to ENSO and changes in the sensitivity of GPP to local temperature and precipitation (see Methods, Eq. (
 <xref rid="Equ4" ref-type="" class="xref">4</xref>)). Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> shows the contribution of each term to the increased GPP responses to ENSO under greenhouse warming. In Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b</xref>, the sum of the linear terms is similar in spatial distribution and magnitude to the simulated changes in the GPP response (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" class="xref">4</xref>), suggesting that this separation is valid. For western Africa, however, the sum of all terms cannot explain the negative value of the changes in the GPP response to ENSO, suggesting that other physical factors might be more important for changes over western Africa.
