  <p class="p">The contribution of anthropogenic warming to drought severity (scPDSI): (a) across the Caribbean. Hatching corresponds to statistically significant contributions at the 95% confidence level. (b) Changes in drought severity as estimated with scPDSI. The negative trend is the drying contribution from anthropogenic warming. (c) Anthropogenic contributions (in percentage) to drought severity on each of the Greater Antilles and the Lesser Antilles. (d) Contribution of anthropogenic warming to areas under mild (scPDSI between −1.0 and −1.9) and severe drought (scPDSI between −3.9 and −3.0). Drought areas were calculated as the number of grid cells equal or below the scPDSI thresholds of mild and severe drought, over the number of total grid cells included in the Caribbean Islands. CRU = Climatic Research Unit; scPDSI = self‐calibrating Palmer Drought Severity Index.</p>
