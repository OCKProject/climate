<p class="p">Since it was introduced in the mid‐1960s, PDSI (Palmer, 
 <xref rid="grl58044-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1965</xref>), and more recently scPDSI (Wells et al., 
 <xref rid="grl58044-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>), has been widely used in North America for drought monitoring and research (Cook, Seager, et al., 
 <xref rid="grl58044-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>; Dai, 
 <xref rid="grl58044-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>; Sheffield et al., 
 <xref rid="grl58044-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>; van der Schrier et al., 
 <xref rid="grl58044-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). PDSI has been also used as a metric in hydroclimate reconstructions over the last thousand years in North America, southern Asia, and Europe (Cook et al., 
 <xref rid="grl58044-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>; Cook, Seager, et al., 
 <xref rid="grl58044-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) and for assessing observed and projected changes in hydroclimate as a result of anthropogenic climate change (e.g., Ault et al., 
 <xref rid="grl58044-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>, 
 <xref rid="grl58044-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>; Lehner et al., 
 <xref rid="grl58044-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>; Williams et al., 
 <xref rid="grl58044-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Although PDSI has been criticized as a soil moisture indicator due to its relatively simple water balance formulation, limitations in long‐term and quality‐controlled climate data across the Caribbean precluded the use of a more sophisticated model like the Variable Infiltration Capacity Model (Liang et al., 
 <xref rid="grl58044-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1994</xref>). Criticism of PDSI has also arisen because the index does not account for the effect of increased atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration on plant physiology, which is projected by earth system models to moderate drought impacts on plant water demand (e.g., Swann et al., 
 <xref rid="grl58044-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). However, as shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="grl58044-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref> and further discussed in section 
 <xref rid="grl58044-sec-0008" ref-type="sec" class="xref">4</xref>, soil moisture and scPDSI calculated over the Caribbean using data from NASA's Global Land Data Assimilation Systems (Rodell et al., 
 <xref rid="grl58044-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>) are consistent in terms of long‐term trends and variability during the period 1979–2017 (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.65). We further selected scPDSI as the main drought metric for comparison to previous work in California that used a similar methodology (e.g., Williams et al., 
 <xref rid="grl58044-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). A comprehensive description of how PDSI and scPDSI are formulated is included in
