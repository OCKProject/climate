<p class="p">We estimated the contributions of anthropogenic warming to the Pan‐Caribbean drought using our downscaled precipitation and temperature products. Alternatively, we used other observationally based gridded climate products that were combined to validate the consistency of our findings (see 
 <xref rid="grl58044-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">Supporting Information S1</xref>). We compared the observed record of PET and scPDSI to an alternate record calculated after removal of anthropogenic warming trends since 1950, following a similar approach as in Williams et al. (
 <xref rid="grl58044-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). We refer to the alternate PET and scPDSI records that do not include warming trends as “adjusted” records. In both calculations, we used unadjusted records of precipitation, net radiation, and wind speed. The anthropogenic contribution to drought was estimated as the difference between PET anomalies and scPDSI calculated using adjusted temperature (
