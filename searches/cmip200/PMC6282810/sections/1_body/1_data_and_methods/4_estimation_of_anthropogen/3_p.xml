<p class="p">We approximated the anthropogenic trends as the difference between naturally only and fully forced ensemble means of temperature anomalies from 28 CMIP5 models during 1950–2016 (see 
 <xref rid="grl58044-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">Supporting Information S1</xref>). Since most CMIP5 historical simulations end in December 2005, we appended the difference between the RCP8.5 scenario and the preindustrial control temperature anomalies from 2006 to 2016. We then smoothed these trends of simulated temperature anomalies using a 30‐year low‐pass filter. To calculate the adjusted temperature record, we subtracted the anthropogenic trends from observationally based gridded temperature products. Despite its simplicity, we used this approach because we aimed to specifically quantify the anthropogenic warming trend, which models are likely to accurately characterize. However, we did not attempt to identify the anthropogenic component of other variables used in the calculation of PET and scPDSI (such as precipitation) because of the difficulty of separating forced and internal variability in these variables (Cook et al.,
