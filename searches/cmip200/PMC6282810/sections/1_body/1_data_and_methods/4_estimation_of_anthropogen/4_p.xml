<p class="p">To assess the robustness of results using the methodology described above, alternate approaches to characterize the anthropogenic warming effect on the Pan‐Caribbean drought were also taken. For example, we evaluated temperature and net radiation data from 14 CMIP5 models to determine the change in the Pan‐Caribbean drought severity due to the ~2‐Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> anthropogenic radiative forcing after the preindustrial era. To do so, we compared PET and scPDSI calculated with historical outputs of temperature and net radiation from CMIP5, against PET and scPDSI using preindustrial control outputs of the same variables. As we did from observed records, in these calculations, we used observed unadjusted precipitation and wind speed data. Modeled temperatures were bias‐corrected, so that the variance and mean match with observed temperature records.
