<p class="p">Uncertainties in our results arise from intrinsic limitations of scPDSI as a soil moisture indicator. However, we compared observational (Global Land Data Assimilation Systems) and modeled (CMIP5) soil moisture anomalies against scPDSI and found consistency in their trends and variability (Figure 
 <xref rid="grl58044-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref>). Although further uncertainties in our results also arise from our statistical downscaling method, the paucity of long‐term high‐quality weather station data and the low resolution of CMIP5 data relative to the size of the Caribbean Islands precluded a more accurate evaluation. Nevertheless, we validated our downscaled products with station data from the Global Historical Climatology Network before computing scPDSI (

 <xref rid="grl58044-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">Figure S3</xref>, our products correlated well with independent Global Historical Climatology Network stations in the Caribbean and northern South America. We also included a combination of various observational data sets in our analysis, obtaining similar results as those reported from our downscaled climate products (

Collectively, our results indicate that anthropogenic warming almost certainly increased drought severity and the area experiencing record‐breaking drought during the Pan‐Caribbean drought, which is similar to what was found for California during the 2012–2014 drought (Williams et al.,
