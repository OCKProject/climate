<p class="p">Our estimates of the contribution of anthropogenic warming to the Pan‐Caribbean did not consider anthropogenic effects on precipitation trends and variability nor how these affected the Pan‐Caribbean drought, as these effects are likely too complex to be approximated by calculating empirical trends (Abatzoglou &amp; Williams,
