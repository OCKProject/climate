<p class="p">The Pan‐Caribbean drought of 2013–2016 was appreciably more severe as a result of anthropogenic warming, a finding that is robust across a range of models and observationally based data sets. This result supports the idea that anthropogenic climate change is already impacting the Caribbean through temperature effects on PET and that the recent drought is likely to be a prelude to future drought events under anthropogenic climate change. That is, we expect future droughts in the region to be increasingly severe because of higher temperatures alone, regardless of changes in precipitation.</p>
