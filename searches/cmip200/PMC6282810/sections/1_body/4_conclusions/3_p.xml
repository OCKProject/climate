<p class="p">As is the case for many of the Small Island Developing States around the world (Holding et al.,

 <xref rid="grl58044-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>), freshwater resources in the Caribbean are already facing a growing number of pressures ranging from saltwater intrusion from sea level rise to demands from the municipal, energy, agricultural, and tourism sectors. Importantly, in the Caribbean Islands, freshwater cannot be moved around at large scales as it can in continental locations like the U.S. southwest. Although, new technologies such as desalination have recently provided relief in some Caribbean Islands, particularly in the Lesser Antilles and the Bahamas (UNESCO, 
 <xref rid="grl58044-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>), the operational cost of desalination plants often outweighs their benefits. Moreover, the economic limitations of many Caribbean nations preclude the implementation of such an option (UNESCO,

Finally, though the 2013–2016 Pan‐Caribbean drought was unprecedented in an historical context, our work suggests that it might be a good analog for future droughts because of the important role temperature played in exacerbating its severity and extent. Further study of the 2013–2016 drought can help inform strategic policy and water management decisions across the region.
