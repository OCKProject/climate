<p class="p">Anthropogenic warming accounted for ~15 ± 2% regional average of the Pan‐Caribbean drought severity across the region, which was significant against the null hypothesis that these trends in scPDSI were random (see section

 <xref rid="grl58044-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>a). For example, the greatest changes in scPDSI were observed in Cuba, where there was a 32 ± 7% (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) contribution of anthropogenic warming to the drought severity, while in the Lesser Antilles, it was only 6 ± 4% and not statistically significant. The contribution of anthropogenic warming to drought severity in Hispaniola Island was 13 ± 4% (

 <xref rid="grl58044-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>a). In Jamaica, anthropogenic warming contributed to ~16 ± 5% of drought severity (

 <xref rid="grl58044-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>c). Anthropogenic warming also increased the probability of occurrence of the Pan‐Caribbean drought from 4% to 7% (two‐tailed

 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05). This result was primarily due to higher‐temperature effects on PET, shifting scPDSI mean toward drier conditions during the Pan‐Caribbean drought. Finally, the averaged contributions estimated from various combinations of observationally based climate products were ~14.5%, with the highest contributions (~16%) from Global Precipitation Climatology Centre and Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature and the lowest (~13%) from Climatic Research Unit (
