<p class="p">Higher temperatures also enhanced the geographic extent of the drought (Figure

In the Caribbean, for example, anthropogenic warming accounted for ~7% of the area affected by mild drought (scPDSI values between −1.9 and −1.0) and for ~20% of the area under severe drought (scPDSI values between −3.9 and −2.0;
