<p class="p">We found that the contribution of anthropogenic warming to drought severity, as estimated with scPDSI, does not respond linearly to changes in PET anomalies at local scales. By comparing Figure

 <xref rid="grl58044-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>a, for example, this nonlinearity is noticeable in southern Hispaniola Island and parts of central‐eastern Cuba, where the largest contributions of anthropogenic warming to PET anomalies were observed. These areas, however, did not correspond to those with the highest contributions of anthropogenic warming to scPDSI. This apparent discrepancy is likely related to how scPDSI is calibrated. For example, the scPDSI's sensitivity to both precipitation and PET varies across the region because it is calibrated to local climate conditions. Consequently, relative contributions of precipitation and PET to scPDSI vary depending on the climate of a specific location. During the Pan‐Caribbean drought, we found that areas with the lowest coefficients of variation in precipitation anomalies coincided with those where there was the largest contribution of anthropogenic warming to drought (
