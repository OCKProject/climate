<p class="p">Observed annual PET anomalies during 2013–2016 were significantly higher than PET anomalies with the adjusted temperatures, increasing PET rates from 27 to 72 mm/year in the Caribbean on average (Figure 
 <xref rid="grl58044-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). The CMIP5 multimodel ensemble supports a similar contribution of higher temperatures to these PET anomalies, increasing from 15 mm/year with the preindustrial control to 51 mm/year with the RCP8.5 scenario with bias‐corrected temperatures and from 9 mm/year to 36 mm/year with uncorrected modeled temperatures (Figure 
 <xref rid="grl58044-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>c). However, the magnitude of simulated PET anomalies estimated with not bias‐corrected CMIP5 temperatures was lower than that from observations, because multimodel ensemble temperatures were also lower in the Caribbean. Changes in PET anomalies on each island were comparable to those observed in the Caribbean as a whole, with the lowest change in the Lesser Antilles (38 mm/year) and the highest in Hispaniola Island (48 mm/year; Figure
