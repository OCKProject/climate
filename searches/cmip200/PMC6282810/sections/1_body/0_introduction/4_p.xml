<p class="p">Previous studies using climate model simulations have projected increased aridity and freshwater stress for the Caribbean in the near future as a result of anthropogenic climate change (Hayhoe,

 <xref rid="grl58044-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>) suggested that drought risk in the Caribbean is highly sensitive to even relatively small increases in global mean temperature. The authors indicate that both the severity and duration of drought in the region will increase with global mean temperatures of 1.5 and 2 °C above historical averages. Similarly, Karnauskas et al. (
 <xref rid="grl58044-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>) suggest that 2 °C higher global mean temperature will increase freshwater stress in the Caribbean by ~25% by the end of the 21st century. Although the projected drying is mostly due to a significant decrease of precipitation rates (30% to 50% in most areas of the Caribbean across most models; IPCC, 
 <xref rid="grl58044-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>), future changes in precipitation are less certain than those projected for temperature (IPCC,
