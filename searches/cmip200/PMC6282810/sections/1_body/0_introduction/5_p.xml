 <xref rid="grl58044-bib-1034" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>), assessing the contribution of anthropogenic warming to drought is critical for better understanding drought risks in the region. Along these lines, we estimate the contribution of anthropogenic warming to the Pan‐Caribbean drought using climate data from observations and model simulations to calculate the scPDSI for the period 1950–2016, which we used as a proxy for surface soil moisture balance given the data limitation of the Caribbean. To address the inherent limitations of coarse resolution data sets for characterizing drought on the Caribbean Islands––many of them with substantial topographic variability over small scales––the observed gridded products are statistically downscaled following Herrera and Ault (
