<p id="Par19" class="p">By analyzing observational and model simulation data, we showed a significant influence of WHWP on El Niño with a 17-month lead time. Results of our evaluation indicated an increase of an SSTA in the WHWP in mid-summer to early-fall induces a northerly wind anomaly over the North Pacific as a result of Rossby wave propagation, which in turn generates a cold SSTA and a high SLPA in the subtropical northeastern Pacific. The cold SSTA and high SLPA together with associated anomalous low-level anticyclone persist through the subsequent winter and spring due to positive air–sea feedback. The equatorward expansion of the cold SSTA and the anomalous circulation in the subtropical North Pacific lead to the generation of a PMM-like pattern in the spring, triggering a La Niña through induced equatorial easterlies that force upwelling Kelvin waves and trade-wind discharging of equatorial heat content

 </sup>. Thus, the occurrence of a PMM-like pattern in the northeastern subtropical Pacific plays a key role in linking WHWP to ENSO.
