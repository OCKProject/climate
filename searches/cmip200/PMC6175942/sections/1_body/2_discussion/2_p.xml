 </sup> that emphasized the effect of the IOD). A multiple regression model was constructed to demonstrate the significant value added to El Niño prediction by including WHWP influence. It has been shown that the combination of the WHWP signal with equatorial HC and IOD signals leads to much better predictions throughout the entire tropical Pacific basin (Figs.
