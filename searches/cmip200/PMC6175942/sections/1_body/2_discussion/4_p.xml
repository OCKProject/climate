<p id="Par22" class="p">Unfortunately, some of CMIP5 models underestimate the lagged relation between WHWP and El Niño (Supplementary Fig.

 </sup>. This is caused by either mean SST biases over the northeastern Pacific near the western coast of Mexico where the PMM develops or the error in the mean circulation over WHWP. Hence, the relation between the regional mean state error and the interannual variability must be examined in detail. If a model is able to capture the WHWP–ENSO teleconnection pattern, the model predictability of El Niño and associated extreme events could be extended beyond one year.
