<p id="Par21" class="p">The WHWP–ENSO relation experienced a marked interdecadal change (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>); actually, the relation was not statistically significant before 1985, which suggests a weaker Atlantic influence on the Pacific in the previous period. The relation has become more robust in the last three decades. Regarding this, we found that climatology of SST in the WHWP is greater than 28.5 °C in recent decades, keeping paced with the SST warming trend in the Atlantic, global warming, or both, which appears to be responsible for this inter-decadal change through deep convection and related atmospheric teleconnection. These aspects will be covered in our future research.
