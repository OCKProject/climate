 </sup>, which has a peak phase in fall, may trigger El Niño by modulating surface wind anomalies over the western equatorial Pacific in the following spring and summer. It was emphasized that the effect of IOD could help predict El Niño events with a 13 to 15-month lead time. These results imply that interbasin interaction can play a key role in El Niño prediction beyond one year. Such a long-lead relation is of great importance as it overcomes the spring predictability barrier of El Niño
