<p id="Par3" class="p">Atmospheric teleconnection from other oceans may also help to trigger El Niño. For example, Atlantic Niño, which peaks in summer, may independently enhance El Niño development by modulating the Walker Circulation in the Atlantic and eastern Pacific sector

 </sup> proposed that a negative sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly in the tropical North Atlantic (TNA) during early spring could induce El Niño development via Rossby wave response to an anomalous heat source in the TNA and local air–sea interactions along the intertropical convective zone (ITCZ) in the subtropical North Pacific, which could be used to predict El Niño with a three-season lead time. Regarding the influence of the TNA, Yu

 </sup> mentioned that a cold SST anomaly (SSTA) in the TNA in summer could force a remote westerly anomaly response in the equatorial Pacific through atmospheric Kelvin wave response and the Indian Ocean relaying effect.
