 </sup>. We defined the HC index as an area average of the HC anomaly in the western Pacific (140°E-150°W, 6°S-6°N) during the JAS season. For the IOD index, the areas for the IOD are 50°–70°E within 10°S–10°N for west and 90°–110°E within 10°S-0° for east in JAS season, and the IOD index is defined as an areal-averaged SST difference (west minus east). The WHWP index is obtained by areal average of SSTA in 60°–105°W within 10°–35°N during the JAS season. With respect to WHWP and IOD indices, previous El Niño signal (Niño3.4 in DJF season) is removed by partial regression since previous ENSO is able to affect the subsequent SSTA in the Atlantic and the Indian Oceans.
