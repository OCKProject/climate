<p id="Par25" class="p">The outputs of 33 CMIP5 models from historical (1970–2000) experiments (with one ensemble member each) were used (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>.) For convenience, a sea surface height (SSH) field was used as a proxy to represent the HC variation. For the SSH, only 28 model outputs were used due to data limitations of some models. Before the lagged regression analysis, both the linear trend and the climatological annual cycle were removed and a three-month running average was applied to reduce the effect of high-frequency variations and to focus on the interannual variability.
