<p id="Par14" class="p">Thus far, we have discussed the possible role of WHWP in El Niño generation with a lag time greater than one year. Given the physical linkage between WHWP and El Niño, SSTA in the WHWP can be used as a precursor for long-lead El Nino prediction. To validate this possibility further, we applied the Granger causality analysis

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">39</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>
 </sup>. From this analysis, SSTA in the WHWP is proved to be independent from previous El Niño and able to trigger El Niño with 17-month lag at a 95% confidence level (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>). A simple statistical model is constructed using the preceding WHWP signal and other precursory signals, such as HC in the equatorial western Pacific and IOD, as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>. The IOD and WHWP indices change slightly based on whether the previous El Niño signals are retained or removed; thus, the result in this study is not sensitive to the effects of previous El Niño, even though El Niño signals are removed from both indices.
