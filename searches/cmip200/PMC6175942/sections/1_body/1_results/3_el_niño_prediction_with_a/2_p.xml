<p id="Par15" class="p">We first examined the influence of equatorial HC, which considers internal dynamics in the Pacific. By regressing the HC index (JAS(0)) onto the observed SSTA (D(1)JF(2)), SSTA fields are reconstructed. Then, the correlation is calculated at each grid point between the observed and reconstructed SSTA, as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a</xref> (similar results for another season can be seen in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">8</xref>). The highest correlation (~0.5) appears over the equatorial Pacific. In a linear sense, this implies that ~25% of the total SSTA variability can be explained by the Pacific HC. Next, in addition to the Pacific HC, the preceding IOD effect is considered via multiple regression analysis. The correlation coefficients between the reconstructed SSTA field and the observed SSTA field are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b</xref>. As depicted in the figure, the maximum correlation coefficient increases to ~0.62, which indicates that up to 38% of the total variance can be explained from a linear perspective. Compared to Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a</xref>, the correlation pattern in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b</xref> appears more symmetrical about the equator, which is indicative of the effect of previously discussed equatorially trapped waves generated by IOD.
