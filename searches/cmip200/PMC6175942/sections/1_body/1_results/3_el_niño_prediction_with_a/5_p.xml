<p id="Par18" class="p">Based on the significant relation between WHWP and ENSO, we examined how WHWP is related to the ENSO event, combined with the IOD and HC in the CMIP5 long-term simulations. For this, the same calculation applied to the observation is repeated. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> shows the ensemble average of correlation of 28 models that correctly captures the lagged WHWP–ENSO relation. As expected, the combination of WHWP with the HC and IOD precursory signals leads to a noticeable increase in the correlation coefficient. Analytical results from individual models also show the possibility that WHWP can improve the El Niño prediction beyond 1-year of lead time (Supplementary Fig.
