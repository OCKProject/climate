<p id="Par16" class="p">Lastly, the effect of WHWP is incorporated into the multiple regression model (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3c</xref>) and then a marked increase in the correlation is obtained. The peak correlation coefficient increases to 0.75, which appears slightly off the equator, reflecting PMM influence. Such a high correlation coefficient means that up to 56% of the ENSO variability can be captured by the combined WHWP–HC–IOD precursory signals. This variance is much higher than that from the combined HC–IOD effect (38%), possibly due to the independence of WHWP. A cross validation (excluding one of their time series) further revealed that correlation coefficients against the observed SSTA exceed 0.60 in the Niño3.4 region, exceeding a 99% confidence level (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">9</xref>). Herein, multiple regression coefficients of the WHWP, IOD, and HC indexes vs. the Niño3.4 index are 0.43, 0.39, and 0.31, respectively, indicating that 42.7%, 35.1%, and 22.2% of the reproduced variability can be explained by those three precursory components.
