<p id="Par11" class="p">While the climatological trade winds persist over the central and eastern North Pacific throughout the year, which is critical to maintaining the local cold SSTA (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a–e</xref>), the seasonal change of the background winds from JAS(0) to JFM(1) (January to March) near the coast of the East Asia is responsible for the formation of a northeast-southwest tilted warm SSTA belt in the northwestern Pacific during winter. Since climatologically northerly mean winds prevail near the coast of the East Asia in this season, an anomalous subtropical anticyclone over the subtropical North Pacific induces anomalous SST warming over its western region with less latent heat fluxes from the ocean’s surface due to a reduction in total wind speed. In addition, the anticyclonic flows deepen the thermocline due to anomalous Ekman downwelling, which results in SST warming

 </sup>. The anomalous subtropical anticyclone is closely coupled with the dipole SSTA pattern, with a tilted warm (cold) SSTA belt to the west (east). The subtropical dipole SSTA pattern becomes strongest in MAM(1) (March to May), resembling a typical PMM pattern (Fig.
