 </sup>. During the southward propagation, seasonal ITCZ provides an environment for active air–sea interaction. Hence, a small perturbation initiated in the subtropics can be intensified when the ITCZ is present. As the subtropical signals of the PMM reach to the equatorial region, the easterly anomalies force oceanic upwelling of Kelvin waves and trade-wind discharging
