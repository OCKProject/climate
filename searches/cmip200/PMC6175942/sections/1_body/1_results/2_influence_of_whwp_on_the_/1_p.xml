<p id="Par9" class="p">The abovementioned observational results point out three key precursory signals for El Niño with ~17-month lead time. The first is the HC over the western equatorial Pacific. The second and the third are IOD and WHWP, respectively. Since the relation between precursory HC and IOD signals and El Niño have been previously reported

 </sup>, this study focuses on the mechanism through which SSTA in WHWP affects El Niño development. To examine specific processes through which WHWP influences an SSTA in the equatorial Pacific, lagged correlation/regression analysis is conducted in various seasons based on the WHWP index (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>) (see Method in terms of index, Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref>). As illustrated in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref>, a strong surface warming in WHWP during JAS(0) induces a simultaneous negative sea level pressure (SLP) anomaly

 </sup>. Note that SST amplitude and areal expansion of WHWP are climatologically greatest during JAS season. Thus, influence of WHWP on the atmospheric circulation is expected to be greatest during this season. If one considers JJA (June to August) or ASO (August to October) instead of JAS, a similar result can be obtained.
