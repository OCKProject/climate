<p id="Par13" class="p">The observational analysis above reveals the significant long-lead impact of WHWP on SSTA in the equatorial Pacific. Model simulation results are also used for the period from 1970 to 2000 to evaluate the performance of climate models participated in the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>). Consistent with the observational analysis, we first checked whether SST in WHWP is capable of influencing subsequent El Niño in each model simulation. It is found that in terms of the correlation between SST in WHWP and Niño3.4 index (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">5</xref>), most of the CMIP5 models (87.8%; 29/33) reproduced the negative WHWP–ENSO correlation, which is consistent with the observation. In particular, 15 models show significant correlation at a 95% confidence level (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>). Further analysis reveals that the models tend to simulate the evolution of the teleconnection patterns from WHWP to ENSO reasonably for approximately six seasons (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">6</xref>). In particular, with respect to the abovementioned 15 models, anomalous northerly winds and SST cooling over the North Pacific during summer to winter were identified (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">7</xref>). In turn, PMM-like and La Niña patterns are shown in MAM(1) and OND(1) (October to December) seasons, respectively. This result warrants a further examination of the CMIP5 models.
