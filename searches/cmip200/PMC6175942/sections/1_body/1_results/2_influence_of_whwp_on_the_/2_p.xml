 </sup> (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">4</xref>). The northerly wind anomalies to the west of the low-level cyclone advect negative moist static energy (MSE) into the subtropical North Pacific, which leads to negative precipitation anomalies over the region. The northerly wind anomalies also enhance the mean northeasterly trade winds in the region, leading to an increase in latent heat flux and thus SST cooling (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref>). Meanwhile, the SST cooling and the suppressed precipitation over the subtropical North Pacific induce an anomalous anticyclone to the west according to the off-equatorial Gill response and atmosphere–ocean interaction in the subtropics

 </sup>. The enhanced northerly wind anomalies associated with the anomalous anticyclone further strengthen the negative MSE advection and associated precipitation anomalies. Through this positive feedback, the local cold SSTA and the positive SLPA are maintained throughout the subsequent winter and spring even after the dissipation of SSTA in WHWP (Fig.
