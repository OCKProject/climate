<p id="Par6" class="p">A lead-lag correlation analysis with Niño3.4 index from December (1) to February (2) (i.e., D(1)JF(2), where the number denotes the sequential order of year) revealed that there is a significant positive correlation between SST and heat content (HC) anomalies over the tropical western Pacific ~17 months prior (July to September, JAS(0)) to an El Niño peak in winter (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Note that HC is closely related to the WWV. Herein, HC is defined as the vertical average of oceanic temperature in the upper 300 m

 </sup> (refer to Methods). Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> indicates that the configuration of SSTA in the western Pacific is an ocean surface manifestation of HC in the western equatorial Pacific. Thus, the HC in the western equatorial Pacific should be considered as a long-lead representative precursor of ENSO, as indicated in a previous study
