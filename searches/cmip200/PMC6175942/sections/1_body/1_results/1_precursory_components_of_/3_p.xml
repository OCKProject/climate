 </sup>, which is the second largest warm pool on the planet. The statistical significance of this long-lead (about six seasons) correlation between WHWP and El Niño suggests that interbasin interaction exists between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, as well as the Pacific and Indian Oceans. It is necessary to consider significant SST signals over the subtropical eastern South Pacific and tropical Atlantic. However, since the signals are small and possibly related to WHWP through atmospheric circulation, we focus on WHWP. Therefore, WHWP–El Niño connection provides an additional precursory signal for possible prediction of El Niño with a lead time greater than one year. It should be noted that the long-lead relation between WHWP and El Niño has become significant during the past three decades (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>). Such an interdecadal change could be attributed to the recent increase in climatological SST in the tropical Atlantic

 </sup>. To validate this information, we conducted modeling experiments using GFDL-CM2.1, where recent climatological SST warming in WHWP in JAS season is forced (see Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref> for more information). In the experiments, a higher climatological SST in WHWP in JAS season resulted in more significant connection between WHWP and Pacific; this result is consistent with the results presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>. These results support the idea that the recent climatological warming in WHWP plays an important role in the WHWP–El Nino connection.
