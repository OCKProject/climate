 </sup> and establishes a low-level cyclonic circulation anomaly. Since the westerly wind anomalies over the western equatorial Pacific is known to provide favorable conditions for El Niño development, an IOD may be regarded as a potential long-lead precursor of El Niño. However, it should be emphasized that during JAS(0) an SSTA over the western Indian Ocean, rather than the eastern Indian Ocean, plays a more significant role in subsequent El Niño development or phase transition
