<p class="p">Monthly mean values of daily maximum near‐surface air temperature (based on daily maximum 2 m air temperature, 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>), incoming shortwave radiation at the surface (

 <sub class="sub">sd</sub>), incoming longwave radiation at the surface (

 <sub class="sub">ld</sub>), soil moisture (
 <italic class="italic">θ</italic>), and land albedo (
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>) are used for the analysis. The data are averaged separately for austral (December‐January‐February) and boreal summer (June‐July‐August), yielding one value per season, grid box, and year for each variable. Since albedo is not well defined when incoming shortwave radiation is zero, regions that experience polar nights are masked in the respective winter hemisphere.
