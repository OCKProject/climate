<p class="p">Two different time spans are considered in the analysis: 1970–1999 to analyze the contribution of the single explanatory variables to interannual temperature variability and 1970–2099 to calculate their contribution to multidecadal temperature trends. To strictly separate these two effects from one another, and to correct for artificial increases of temperature variability (Scherrer et al., 
 <xref rid="grl57416-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>), all variables used for the 30‐year time span are linearly detrended, while the data for the 130‐year span are grouped into thirteen 10‐year long bins and averaged in each bin separately to eliminate the influence of year‐to‐year variability.
