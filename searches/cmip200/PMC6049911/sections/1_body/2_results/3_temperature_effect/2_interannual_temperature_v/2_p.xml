<p class="p">The effect of typical variations of the four explanatory variables on temperature for JJA and DJF during the detrended time span 1970–1999 (i.e., for interannual temperature variability) is displayed in the left columns in Figure 
 <xref rid="grl57416-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>. Variations of incoming shortwave radiation have a strong impact on temperature in middle‐to‐high latitudes during summer (up to about 1.5 K) but only a minor contribution during winter. Close to the equator the influence of shortwave radiation is generally rather low. The impact of incoming longwave radiation on temperature is especially pronounced in middle‐to‐high latitudes during DJF. In lower latitudes and during JJA the influence is less strong but still ranges up to about 1.0 K. The impact of soil moisture variations on temperature is in general negative. It ranges up to about 0.5 K in some soil moisture hot spots (cf. Miralles et al.,

 <xref rid="grl57416-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>), but it is negligible in deserts where water is scarce and in middle‐to‐high latitudes during winter when the soil is frozen. The impact of albedo variations is as well mostly negative. It is particularly strong in some regions in northern Canada, Siberia, the Tibetan Plateau, and Patagonia during JJA and in a band spanning from North America over Europe and Central Asia during DJF. In some desert regions albedo is positively related to temperature.
