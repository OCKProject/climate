<p class="p">The contribution of changes in the explanatory variables (i.e., mean changes between 1970–1999 and 2070–2099) to the multidecadal temperature trend (1970–2099) is displayed in the right columns of Figure 
 <xref rid="grl57416-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>. Incoming longwave radiation (which includes greenhouse gas and water vapor effects) has by far the strongest (and always positive) effect on temperatures over land, especially pronounced in high northern latitudes during DJF. Incoming shortwave radiation contributes to temperature increases in Europe and large parts of Eurasia and North America during JJA, while it has a cooling effect in North America and Eurasia during winter. Moreover, it exhibits a dipole warming/cooling pattern in Australia and South America. Soil moisture trends also generally contribute to temperature increases, especially in the Mediterranean, the Southern USA/Mexico, and to a lesser magnitude in Brazil and South Africa. Albedo has a strong positive effect on temperature during DJF in parts of North America, Europe, and Central Asia, and in high northern latitudes during JJA. In contrast, albedo shows a slightly negative relation to the temperature evolution in deserts.
