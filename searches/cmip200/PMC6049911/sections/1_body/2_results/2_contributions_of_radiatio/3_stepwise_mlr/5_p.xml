Although the importance of longwave radiation (which includes greenhouse gas and water vapor effects) is dominant, the other considered variables contribute a substantial part for explaining the multidecadal temperature trend as well. This highlights the fact that regional processes (and not only greenhouse gas concentration trends) are important to assess changes in near‐surface air temperature (e.g., Berg et al.,
