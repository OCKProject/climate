 <sup class="sup">2</sup>. Incoming longwave radiation has the highest contribution (∼0.30 on average), followed by incoming shortwave radiation (∼0.29). The contribution of longwave radiation is more or less stable over the different latitudes but especially strong in winter in high latitudes. In contrast, shortwave radiation has the highest contribution in the respective summer hemisphere. The contributions of soil moisture (∼0.09) and albedo (∼0.11) are lower than those of radiation but important in some latitudes. Soil moisture shows the highest values between −40°S and 20°N, extending a bit further into the respective summer hemisphere, but decreasing strongly toward the poles. Albedo has the highest share in latitudes between 30° and 60° in the respective winter hemisphere and in high northern latitudes during JJA.
