They display the latitudinal variations of the number of climate models for which the stepwise MLR includes the respective explanatory variables. Both incoming longwave and shortwave radiation are considered as significant variables for almost all climate models independent of the latitude (only in high latitudes their importance decreases). Soil moisture is a significant variable for most climate models around the equator and in midlatitudes in the Southern Hemisphere as well as in midlatitudes in the north during JJA. Albedo is significant for the majority of climate models in midlatitudes in the respective winter hemisphere and in very high latitudes in the north during JJA. Overall, the number of climate models in which each variable is considered as significant based on the stepwise MLR reflects their respective contributions to total
