 <sup class="sup">2</sup> is about 0.78 during boreal summer (JJA) and 0.79 during austral summer (DJF), indicating that more than three quarters of the interannual temperature variability can be explained by the linear model. Especially in high latitudes and close to the equator, the linear model performs very well, while
