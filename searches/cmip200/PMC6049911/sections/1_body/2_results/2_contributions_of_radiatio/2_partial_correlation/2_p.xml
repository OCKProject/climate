 <xref rid="grl57416-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> shows the multimodel mean partial correlation between near‐surface air temperature 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic> and the different explanatory variables during the detrended time span 1970–1999 (i.e., interannual variability). Incoming shortwave and longwave radiation show overall the strongest partial correlations with temperature, with most climate models having significant correlations (indicated as gray/black stippling) in large areas of the world. Incoming shortwave radiation exhibits a pronounced change in correlations between JJA and DJF in middle‐to‐high latitudes, with high values during summer and low values during winter. In lower latitudes the patterns are similar in both seasons. Incoming longwave radiation has high partial correlations in middle‐to‐high latitudes in both seasons with slightly higher values during winter. For soil moisture and albedo the multimodel agreement is generally lower than for incoming radiation (indicated by the smaller stippling extent). Soil moisture exhibits negative correlations with temperature in many regions, except for deserts and large parts of the Northern Hemisphere during winter where they are close to zero. The correlations between albedo and temperature are negative in middle‐to‐high latitudes (especially during winter) and positive in large parts of the tropics.
