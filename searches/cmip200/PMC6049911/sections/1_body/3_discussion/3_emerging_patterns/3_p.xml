<p class="p">The effect of incoming longwave radiation on temperature is especially strong in high northern latitudes during winter, both for interannual variability and multidecadal trend (Figures 
 <xref rid="grl57416-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>e–
 <xref rid="grl57416-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>h). This effect can be explained by clouds that hinder thermal radiation to leave to space and keep temperatures high, while (nighttime) clear‐sky conditions cause temperatures to decrease. Although shortwave radiation is also impacted by cloud cover, its influence in high latitudes during winter is relatively low because of the flat incident angles and the low energy (Figures

 <xref rid="grl57416-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>d). In other regions, the impact of shortwave radiation on the multidecadal temperature trend is strongly connected to changes in cloud cover (see

 <xref rid="grl57416-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S7</xref>). The projected decrease of cloud cover in large parts of the world during summer leads to higher incoming shortwave radiation and, thus, a positive contribution to the temperature trend. The widespread increase of cloud cover in North America and Eurasia during winter causes a reduction of incoming shortwave radiation and, thus, a negative impact on the temperature trend (Figures
