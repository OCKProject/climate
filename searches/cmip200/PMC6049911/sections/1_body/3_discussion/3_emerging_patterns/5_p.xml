<p class="p">The importance of albedo is highest in regions that experience varying snow cover in different years or snow cover changes with climate change (Figures

In some arid and semi‐arid regions (e.g., Sahara and Sahel), albedo and temperature are positively related, which is very likely due to some sporadic rain events after which the soil is darker and temperatures are lower. The albedo signal in the Amazon region might be caused by land cover changes due to deforestation. Considering the multidecadal trend, global warming leads to a poleward shift of the areas in which snow cover affects near‐surface air temperature, resulting in positive albedo impacts on temperature in high northern latitudes during JJA as well as North America and Eurasia during DJF.
