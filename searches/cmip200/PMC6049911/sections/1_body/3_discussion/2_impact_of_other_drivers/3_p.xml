<p class="p">To test the impact of the mutual dependence between incoming longwave radiation and temperature for the multidecadal time scale, we replace incoming longwave radiation by global mean temperature, which also accounts for the climate change signal (Figure 
 <xref rid="grl57416-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). While this replacement clearly has an impact on the sign and magnitude of incoming shortwave radiation (caused by the fact that shortwave radiation partly takes up the effect of longwave radiation, which acts as a hidden variable), the patterns of the land surface conditions stay generally the same (except for middle‐to‐high latitudes during DJF).
