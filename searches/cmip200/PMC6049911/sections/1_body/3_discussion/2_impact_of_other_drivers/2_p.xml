<p class="p">Focusing on incoming radiation and land surface conditions as explaining variables, most of the interannual temperature variability and multidecadal temperature trend can be explained. Nevertheless, other variables may influence temperature as well. Holmes et al. (
 <xref rid="grl57416-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>) showed that thermal advection can play an important role for month‐to‐month temperature variations. When we use only thermal advection as explanatory variable for the stepwise MLR, the obtained patterns and

 <xref rid="grl57416-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S5</xref>). Thermal advection can, for example, trigger albedo and soil moisture feedbacks that itself affect near‐surface air temperature. Likewise, advection can alternate cloud cover and the amount of incoming shortwave radiation. If these confounding effects are not considered, the effect of thermal advection on temperature might thus be overestimated. On the other hand, thermal advection influences the amount of outgoing (and thus also incoming) longwave radiation. In regions with substantial thermal advection (see, e.g., Holmes et al., 
 <xref rid="grl57416-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>), our study might thus overestimate the contribution of incoming longwave radiation to
