<p class="p">Since many processes in the Earth System are nonlinear (Good et al., 
 <xref rid="grl57416-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>), using a linear regression model is a simplification of reality. Still it is a helpful tool to estimate first‚Äêorder contributions, even if it does not allow to draw any conclusions about causal relations. While for some processes causality based on the physical understanding of the Earth System can be established, feedbacks within the system can also reverse this causality. Moreover, inherent collinearities between the different explanatory variables make it hard to estimate the relative importance of the single driving mechanisms for temperature variability and trend. Thus, we use the method proposed by Azen and Budescu (
