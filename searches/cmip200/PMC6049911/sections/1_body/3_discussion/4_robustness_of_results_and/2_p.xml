<p class="p">The results presented here are based on the output of 35 CMIP5 models. To test their robustness, we applied the same analysis to the reanalysis products ERA‐Interim and ERA‐Interim/Land (Balsamo et al.,

Additionally, the results for interannual temperature variability are consistent when using a 50‐year time period (1970–2019) instead. Moreover, all results are consistent when applying LASSO regression instead of stepwise MLR. The uncertainty of
