<p class="p">As many other studies, we use a limited set of explanatory variables as input for our linear model. Thus, (hidden) variables that are not considered in the analysis, but have (potential) control on some of the considered variables, can affect the results. Examples of such variables are thermal advection, heat entrainment, cloud cover, greenhouse gas and water vapor concentrations in the atmosphere, land cover change, precipitation, and evapotranspiration. It is, however, not the aim of this study to perform a comprehensive analysis of all possible drivers but to limit the analysis to a set of variables that we consider as key for assessing the radiative and land surface contributions to interannual temperature variability and multidecadal temperature trend.</p>
