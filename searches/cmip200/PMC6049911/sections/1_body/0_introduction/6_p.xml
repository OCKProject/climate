<p class="p">The albedo determines how much of the incoming shortwave radiation is reflected back to space. It has a particularly pronounced impact on temperature in regions that experience transitions between snow‐covered and snow‐free states over the course of the year (Ellis &amp; Leathers, 
 <xref rid="grl57416-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1999</xref>). Changes in albedo caused by global warming can have important impacts locally (e.g., polar amplification; Graversen &amp; Wang,
