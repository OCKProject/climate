<p class="p">Here we apply multiple linear regression (MLR) to quantify the contributions of incoming radiation and land surface conditions on temperature variability and trend. Additionally, we estimate the influence of thermal advection. As we are particularly interested in the contributions of land surface conditions to the temperature evolution, we focus on monthly mean daily maximum temperature for which the influence of soil moisture is especially pronounced (Jaeger &amp; Seneviratne,
