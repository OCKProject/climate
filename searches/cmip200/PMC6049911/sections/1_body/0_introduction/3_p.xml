<p class="p">One of the most important factors determining near‐surface air temperature is the amount of incoming radiation at the surface. On land, the absorbed net radiation as well as its partitioning into the different heat fluxes is further modulated by the state of the land surface. Here we quantify the contributions of both incoming radiation as well as land surface conditions to interannual variability and multidecadal trend of monthly means of daily maximum near‐surface air temperature. In particular, incoming shortwave radiation, incoming longwave radiation, soil moisture, and albedo are considered as potential drivers.</p>
