<p id="Par25" class="p">California is exceptional. Here projected stronger and more extensive Aleutian Low counteracts the pole-ward advance of the Subtropical High resulting in increased precipitation intensity due to dynamically strengthened on-shore vapor transport, likely delivered in more intense atmospheric rivers
