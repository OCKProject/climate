<p id="Par23" class="p">Using daily projections from 30 CMIP5 global climate models forced by the RCP 8.5 scenario during the period of 2060–2089 relative to the period of 1960–1989, we investigated changes in winter precipitation in five MedClim regions around the globe, which are mostly robustly projected to become drier. We emphasized winter precipitation projections over CAL, which are distinguished from the other MedClim regions by greater model spread and, in aggregate, a rather subtle tendency to become wetter. By investigating changes in the frequency and intensity of the daily precipitation distribution, we showed that winter precipitation trends over MedClim regions tend to be the net result of decreasing frequencies of low- and medium-intensity precipitation and, in some regions, increasing trends in extreme precipitation events. Over all the MedClim regions except CAL, decreasing trends in low- and medium-intensity precipitation play the definitive role in causing winter precipitation to decline. In CAL, however, while there is little model consensus on the sign of the overall precipitation frequency trend, GCMs robustly project increased extreme precipitation frequency and intensity. The result for CAL is a weak model ensemble tendency towards wetter winters.</p>
