<p id="Par26" class="p">CMIP5 GCMs are for the most part too coarsely resolved to adequately represent Californiaâ€™s topography; we, therefore, suspect that precipitation due specifically to ARs, being strongly orographic, is underestimated in GCMs. Thus we need downscaling to better resolve AR-related precipitation and other heavy precipitation events to better quantify future precipitation trends in orographically complex California. Here we only investigated winter (DJF) precipitation changes. However, refs 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">24</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">25</xref> found that in California, projected precipitation differed between winter (somewhat wetter) and the shoulder seasons of fall and especially spring (drier in late 21st Century).
