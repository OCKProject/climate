<p id="Par24" class="p">Competing mechanisms operate in determining MedClim precipitation changes. Thermodynamic changes, via enhanced saturation vapor pressure in a warmer atmosphere, are projected to enhance the potential for stronger extreme precipitation events. Changes in large-scale dynamic structures, via poleward extensions of the subtropical high-pressure zone, are expected to steer midlatitude cyclones away from most MedClim regions, i.e. MedClim regions are projected to become more subtropical. In the MED, although dynamics are projected to steer storms away from the region, strong warming results in occasionally stronger extremes due to the thermodynamic effect of enhanced vapor transport in a warmer atmosphere.</p>
