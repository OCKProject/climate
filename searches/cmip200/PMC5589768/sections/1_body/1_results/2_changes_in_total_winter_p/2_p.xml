<p id="Par8" class="p">Projected average precipitation changes in each region (averaged only over grid cells that satisfy the MedClim criteria: see Methods Section for details) are summarized in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b</xref>. Over the four MedClim regions other than CAL, nearly all of the models consistently project drying. Over CAL, two-thirds of the models project wetter winters. Of course, there are significant model-to-model differences in the magnitude of the projected change. On average, CMIP5 models project a 12% reduction (ranging from 1% to −38%) in precipitation over MED, a 19% reduction (ranging from −5% to −40%) over SAA, a 23% reduction (ranging from −5% to −42%) over SAF, and a 20% reduction (ranging from 1% to −38%) over AUS. MED, SAA, SAF and AUS all exhibit significant model agreement in the sign of changes, with a strong majority of models indicating drying, and a comparable magnitude of model spread (ranging from 35 to 39%). Over CAL, the mean precipitation is projected to increase by 7% (ranging from −28% to 78%). Even though the projected mean tendency over CAL is towards wetter winters, model spread is three times that over the other regions making CAL stand out as the only MedClim region where climate models strongly disagree about wintertime precipitation change. The definition of MedClim regions does not affect our overall conclusion (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1b</xref>). Moreover, model resolution does not seem to systematically affect model realism in simulating the winter contribution to total precipitation, an essential feature of Mediterranean climates (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>). Nor does model realism systematically affect the magnitude of projected change or even its sign in the case of CAL (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>). This is in line with results of ref. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref> who showed that GCM realism vis a vis salient features of the observed regional climate is not a relevant factor in precipitation changes that the GCMs project for the future climate of the Western U.S.
