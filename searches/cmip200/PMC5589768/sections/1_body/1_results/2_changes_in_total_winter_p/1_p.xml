<p id="Par7" class="p">The projected late-century changes in ensemble mean winter precipitation are expressed in percent of historical (1960–89) precipitation and shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref>. Except over CAL, the models consistently project future drying over MedClim regions, especially over those in the SH. In composite, all of the MedClim regions exhibit a meridional gradient of precipitation change, with less drying at higher vs subtropical latititudes. In CAL, the ensemble average winter precipitation decreases in the south, especially over northern Baja California, Mexico, by as much as 10%, and increases over central-northern California by 5 to 15%. CAL is projected to become wetter in winter aggregate, albeit model consensus is weak.
