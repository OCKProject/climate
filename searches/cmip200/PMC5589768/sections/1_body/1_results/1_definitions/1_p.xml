 <sup class="sup">th</sup> Century in five Mediterranean regions around the globe – the Mediterranean basin (MED), South America (SAA), California (CAL), South Africa (SAF), and Australia (AUS). Winter season is the peak of the wet season over these MedClim regions. Wintertime contribution to total precipitation by region is as follows: MED: 38%; CAL: 57%; SAA: 50%; SAF: 40%, AUS: 38% (Fig.

We must be mindful of this fact when interpreting results, particularly for SAF, which is represented by as few as a couple of grid cells in the native resolution of the coarsest GCMs. All models were re-gridded to the common 2 × 2 grid, however, same as the observations, prior to any analysis. To ameliorate the well-known GCM drizzle problem
