 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4a</xref> shows the ensemble mean projected change in wintertime SAT, which serves as an index of the amount of atmospheric warming and the increased potential to carry moisture. Overall, land areas show greater wintertime warming than oceans. Greenland is a notable exception. The tropical Pacific shows somewhat greater projected warming compared to other ocean areas. On average, SH MedClim regions show less warming (2.1 to 2.3 °C) compared to CAL and MED (3.2 and 3.4 °C, respectively). The pattern of IVT increase (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4b</xref>) generally follows this pattern of increased SAT. ref.

 </sup>. SAT and IVT increases are generally larger in the NH than at the same latitudes in the SH, at least partially explaining why increases in heavy to extreme precipitation are larger over the NH MedClim regions than over their SH counterparts.
