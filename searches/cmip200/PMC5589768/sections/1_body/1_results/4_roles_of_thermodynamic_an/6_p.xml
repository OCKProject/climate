<p id="Par21" class="p">Since mean precipitation change is determined by the balance between increased dry day frequency and that of extreme precipitation, we explore whether the inter-model spread in these two quantities is explained by changes in MSLP and IVT, respectively. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5a</xref> shows the regional average variation of dry days in response to changes in MSLP for individual models over all MedClim regions. The models generally exhibit positive relationships, i.e., dry days increase with MSLP, although in some regions (notably SAF and CAL), a few models project an increase in dry days with a slight decrease in MSLP. Across the 30 GCMs, a strong correlation exists between MSLP and dry days (r = 0.64 to 0.88) over four of the five regions, while in SAF the correlation is weaker (r = 0.37). The relationship between MSLP and the mean precipitation change is weaker (NH; r ~ 0.56), especially in the Southern Hemisphere (SH; r ~ 0.45) (see online supporting information, Fig.
