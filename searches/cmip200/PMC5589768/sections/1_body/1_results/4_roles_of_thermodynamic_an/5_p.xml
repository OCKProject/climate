<p id="Par20" class="p">Overall, the SH MedClim regions are projected to moisten the least due to the thermodynamic effect and dynamical factors are projected to steer storms away from these regions. However, both CAL and MED regions are projected to moisten more than their SH counterparts, consistently with the thermodynamic implications of stronger winter warming. Moreover, a southeastward expanding Aleutian Low counteracts the northward expanding Subtropical High over CAL resulting in no appreciable change in dry day frequency, but dynamically promoting land-falling ARs while warming contributes thermodynamically to wetter ARs. The drying trend observed for the other MedClim regions, however, is associated with increased moisture divergence due to the strengthening of quasi-stationary subtropical high-pressure systems, leading to less frequent precipitation in spite of increased moisture-holding capacity of a warming atmosphere.</p>
