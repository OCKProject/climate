<p id="Par22" class="p">Similarly, the frequency of extreme precipitation events is strongly linked with IVT over regions where large increases in extremes are projected. The correlation between these two quantities is 0.83 over MED and 0.63 over CAL, whereas it is weak over the SH regions (correlations &lt;0.28). Over SAA, SAF and AUS, increases in IVT are insignificant and the frequency of extreme precipitation events tends to change little on average. This highlights the thermodynamic control on extreme precipitation trends.</p>
