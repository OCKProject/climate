<p id="Par16" class="p">Projected precipitation changes over MedClim regions can, to various degrees, be explained by dynamical factors associated with changes in storm tracks and weather regimes, along with thermodynamic factors associated with increased water vapor content in a warmer atmosphere. It is moreover possible that dynamical factors can preferentially affect seasonal precipitation by impacting precipitation frequency
