 </sup>. Over most MedClim regions, the quasi-stationary subtropical high-pressure system is projected to strengthen by end-of-century by 3–6 mb. However, over the North Pacific, the model ensemble projects a deepening of the Aleutian low-pressure system core by ~4 mb and a notable southeastward extension of the Aleutain Low toward CAL (Fig.
