<p id="Par15" class="p">An example helps to clarify this concept. Over the MED region, although the frequency of extreme precipitation days is clearly projected to increase (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b</xref>; several models project more than a 100% increase), most models project a drier future. This is due to the greater influence of the projected increased frequency of dry days (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a</xref>), which translates into decreased frequency in most precipitation intensity categories (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref>). In CAL, this is also possible, and, HadGEM2-ES provides an example of a GCM projecting increased frequency of dry days and no change in extreme precipitation frequency resulting in a drier future winter precipitation. However, there is a larger model spread in CAL compared to other regions; many models project strong positive trends in the frequency of extreme precipitation, which cause increases in winter precipitation in GCMs marked by weak trends in dry day frequency

 </sup> but not necessarily in GCMs whose dry day frequency is stronger. BNU-ESM is a model showing a strong increase in the frequency of extreme precipitation (by &gt;200%) and a weak increase in dry day frequency (by 3.8%), and thus an increase in winter precipitation (by 13%).
