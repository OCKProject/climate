<p id="Par14" class="p">A rather strong relationship also exists between projected precipitation change in a given model and its change in the frequency of extreme precipitation over all regions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b</xref>). Correlations over the 30 GCMs range from 0.65 in SAF to 0.86 in CAL. Overall, the change in winter precipitation is determined by the interplay between changes in frequency of dry days and very heavy precipitation days. Changes in the frequency of dry days are inversely related to changes in frequency of heavy precipitation days (correlations ranging from −027 in AUS to −0.60 in CAL). However, trends in the number of dry days dominantly determine the change in winter precipitation over MED, SAA, and SAF, explaining ~60% of this change (bivariate regression model), whereas trends in extreme precipitation frequency explain ~40% of the seasonal total change. Over CAL and AUS trends in frequency and extremes each explain approximately equal shares of the projected change in winter precipitation.
