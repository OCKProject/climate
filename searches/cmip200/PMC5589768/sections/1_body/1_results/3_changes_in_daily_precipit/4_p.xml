<p id="Par12" class="p">Precipitation intensity decreases in all categories in the MedClim regions of the SH but increases in those of the NH (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b</xref>) except below the 40
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> percentile threshold over the MED region. Precipitation intensity increases with percentile categories over the MED and CAL regions; however, CAL generally shows a much stronger increase. In the SH, the decrease in precipitation intensity is stronger in the moderate percentile threshold categories compared to the dry and wet tails of the PDF. This suggests that projected precipitation PDFs undergo shape changes amounting to a flattening for the SH MedClim regions in contrast to an extension and thickening of the wet tail for the NH regions, particularly for CAL, where precipitation intensity increases progressively in all intensity categories.
