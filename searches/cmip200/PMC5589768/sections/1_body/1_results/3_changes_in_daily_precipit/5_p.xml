<p id="Par13" class="p">We next consider the individual GCMs to investigate how changes in the frequencies of dry days and days with extreme precipitation might affect changes in total seasonal precipitation change for each MedClim region (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). All of the regions exhibit significant and clear inverse relationships between changes in dry day frequency and the changes in total winter precipitation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a</xref>). Across the 30 GCMs, the highest correlations (r = ~0.9) occur over MED and CAL with 80% of the inter-model variance in projected seasonal precipitation changes explained by changes in dry day frequency. The slope of the regression between these two quantities (~0.3%) is similar over all of the regions. CAL displays a larger spread in winter precipitation, which is better explained by the changes in dry day frequency compared to other regions. Although the across-model relationships between projected precipitation and dry day frequency is consistent from region to region, the regional changes within individual GCMs are not very consistent; a model with a large increase in dry day frequency over one region does not necessarily associate with a large increase over another.
