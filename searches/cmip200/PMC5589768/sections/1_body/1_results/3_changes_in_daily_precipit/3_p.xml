<p id="Par11" class="p">The large increase in extreme precipitation frequency over CAL (amounting to more than one extra &gt;99
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> percentile day each winter by late-century) is consistent with an overall change in the shape of the probability density function (PDF) of daily precipitation amounts. Compared to the other MedClim regions, CAL exhibits smaller decreases in precipitation frequencies for categories from near-median daily precipitation and above, more strongly increased frequency of heavy precipitation (~15% in the 90â€“99% category), and more-than-doubling in the frequency of extreme precipitation as described above.
