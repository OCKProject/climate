<p id="Par2" class="p">Mediterranean climates represent a precarious balance, being exposed to mid-latitude weather in winter, while chronically challenged by subtropical dryness in summer. Characterized by typically infrequent frontal storms confined to the cold season, water resources in Mediterranean climates are volatile from year to year due to sample variance, i.e. one large storm can make an inordinate difference to total annual precipitation
