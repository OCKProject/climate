<p id="Par4" class="p">Recently, a number of studies have explored causes of projected precipitation change over California. For example, ref. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">8</xref> attributed the trend towards wetter winters over California to a stronger sub-tropical jet stream. Analysis by ref. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref> found that model-to-model differences in winter precipitation over California are mainly explained by differences in projected mid-latitude cyclone activity. ref. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref> explained trends towards wetter California by a lengthening of the intermediate-scale stationary waves in the presence of accelerated sub-tropical westerlies. These previous studies of future precipitation primarily resolved annual to seasonal time scales, focused on California alone, and mainly investigated dynamical mechanisms.
