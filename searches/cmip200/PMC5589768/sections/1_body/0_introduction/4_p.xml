<p id="Par5" class="p">As we shall see, compared to other MedClim regions, seasonal precipitation projections over California are characterized by uncertainty. This uncertainty stems in part from two opposing and robust signals: decreased frequency and increased intensity of projected daily precipitation

 </sup>. The goal of this work is to investigate projected precipitation changes over California by exploring the similarities and differences in daily precipitation projections over all MedClim regions. We study changes in the statistics of daily precipitation, with a focus on extreme events, to understand projected changes in precipitation regimes over MedClim regions and their sensitivity to regional thermodynamic and dynamic processes. In particular, we aim to achieve a clearer understanding of projected precipitation over California than is implied by the large model spread in annual precipitation.
