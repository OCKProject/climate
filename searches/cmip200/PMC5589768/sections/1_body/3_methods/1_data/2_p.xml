<p id="Par30" class="p">The response of anthropogenic warming is evaluated as the difference between the 30-year period at the end of the century (2060–2089) projected under the RCP 8.5 emission scenario and it’s counterpart (1960–1989) in the historical simulations. The historical simulations were forced with observed long-lived greenhouse gases, solar radiation, and volcanic aerosols for the observational period, whereas the RCP 8.5 simulations were forced with an increase in the atmospheric concentration of CO
