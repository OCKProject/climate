 </sup> while observations do not report precipitation below a certain threshold. For consistency between models and observations we select a threshold of 1 mm/day, below which both observations and models, re-gridded to the same 2 × 2° grid, are considered to have a dry day (we direct readers to ref. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref> for choice of threshold used and further details).
