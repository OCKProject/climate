<p id="Par31" class="p">We define MedClim regions following the Köppen-Geiger climate classification scheme as having cool, damp winters and hot, dry summers, applying thresholds for seasonal temperature and precipitation at each grid (we direct readers to ref. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref> for details). The 50-year period of 1950–2000 monthly climatological observed temperature from the Global Historical Climatology Network version 2 and the Climate Anomaly Monitoring System (GHCN CAMS; ref. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">28</xref>) and precipitation from the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC; ref. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">29</xref>) were used to identify the Mediterranean-climate regions on a 2° × 2° latitude-longitude grid. The five Mediterranean-climate regions around the globe defined by this scheme are indicated by stippling on Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>; they include the Mediterranean basin (MED: max latitude and longitude extent, 30°–45° N, 30° W–60° E), California (CAL: 30°–42°N, 127°–115°W), South Africa (SAF: 33°–37°S, 15°–20°E), South America (SAA: 30°–45°S, 75°–70°W), and Australia (AUS: 32°–42°N, 110°–142°E).
