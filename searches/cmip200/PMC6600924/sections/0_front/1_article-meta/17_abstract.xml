 <p class="p">State park lands in the United States are important to the health and well-being of the American public. Managing these lands for human enjoyment comes at a cost, however. Management requires capital to ensure visitorsâ€™ health and safety, to provide infrastructure and services that facilitate desired outdoor recreation activities, and to protect natural and cultural resources. By constructing and analyzing a dataset describing the operations of all 50 state park systems in the United States, we were able to determine the operating costs of state park systems will likely increase substantially in the coming decades. These increases are largely attributable to continued increases in attendance (visitor-hours) and, to a much lesser extent, climate change.</p>
