<p class="p">While operating expenditures are expected to increase substantially under any of the plausible future climate scenarios, the magnitude of these increases are small relative to those expected under a scenario in which historical attendance trends (1984–2017) persist until midcentury. Under this scenario, operating expenditures would reach $47.88 billion by 2050, more than five times those expected under the RCP8.5 scenario (

 <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>), we believe these future attendance increases to state parks are plausible, if not likely. We doubt the operating expenditures of the nation’s state park systems will approach $50 billion given that state legislatures often prioritize other public services over environmental conservation and the provisioning of outdoor recreation opportunities (
 <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>). Currently, an average of only 0.16% of the states’ operating budgets are appropriated for the operation of state park systems [range: 0.05 [Wisconsin] – 0.54 [South Dakota] (
