<p class="p">Before this investigation, the relationship between the costs of maintaining parks and protected areas and climate had not been examined. Research into other public goods and services, such as health care, agriculture, and water resources, has found that increases in temperatures may impose additional operational costs (
 <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>). Our investigation determined temperature, but not precipitation, is positively related with operating costs. Over the past 34 y, we estimate that for every 1% increase in annual mean temperature, Americaâ€™s state park systems have seen an $11.51 increase in operating expenditures per acre. We found the operating expenditures of state park systems at lower latitudes are more sensitive to increases in temperatures relative to those at higher latitudes. This is likely attributable to the fact parks in warmer climates are more costly to manage (

 <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>) may result in warming having a larger actual impact in northern states.
