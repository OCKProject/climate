<p class="p">It is important to note that our analysis only captures the climate-related costs incurred solely by state park systems; it does not capture other costs that may be borne by other state and federal entities aside from state parks. As an example, rising temperatures will likely increase the frequency and severity of fire on state parklands; the costs associated with suppressing these fires is incurred by state and federal fire agencies. Our estimates should be interpreted as a lower bound of total cost of climate-related impacts to state parklands.</p>
