<p class="p">Across most of the country, future climate change will result in a continued expansion of the high-use summer season (
 <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>); this expansion will be accompanied by increased operating costs. For the three greenhouse gas emissions trajectories we examined (in which all other output factors were held constant), the average cost of maintaining outdoor recreation opportunities provided by state park systems will increase between $149 per acre (RCP2.6) and $238.28 per acre (RCP8.5). Aggregating these costs across all 50 state park systems, we expect total operating expenditures between $6.99 billion (RCP2.6) and $9.00 billion (RCP8.5) by 2050 (
 <xref rid="t02" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). These findings are logical, as warming results in state park system managers keeping their systems open for longer periods of time and, for some geographic locations, having to mitigate the undesirable impacts rising temperatures can have on infrastructure and natural resources.
