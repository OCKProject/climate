<p class="p">Our results suggest a dire future for America’s state park systems. Attendance has consistently grown over the past three and a half decades. If this trend continues into the future, state legislatures will face very difficult decisions about how to ensure their publics can continue to receive the social and cultural ecosystem services provided by parklands. If the states fail to increase annual appropriations to their states’ park systems, specifically mandating those funds support the maintenance of existing infrastructure, facilities, and services, the quality of outdoor recreation opportunities and the environmental quality of state parklands will decline.</p>
