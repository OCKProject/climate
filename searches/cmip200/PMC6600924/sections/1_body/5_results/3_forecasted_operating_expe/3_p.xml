<p class="p">Collectively, these findings suggest climate change, specifically an increase in annual mean temperatures, will increase the cost of providing outdoor recreation opportunities and managing parkland. However, the increased costs attributable to climate change are marginal relative to the costs associated with continued increases in attendance. Attendance to state park systems is the predominant factor driving the operating costs associated with maintaining existing infrastructure, facilities, and services.</p>
