<p class="p">The remaining three scenarios assume attendance will remain constant at 2017 levels, while temperatures will increase to varying degrees following the RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 greenhouse gas emissions trajectories (
 <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>). Under the RCP2.6 trajectory, average operating costs are expected to increase to $581.00 per acre, a change of $149.00 relative to current average operating expenditures. Under the moderate emissions trajectory (RCP4.5), this value increases to $614.31 per acre, a change of $182.31 relative to current average operating expenditures. Forecasted operating expenditures under the highest emissions trajectory (RCP8.5) are $670.28 per acre, a change of $238.28 relative to current average operating expenditures (
 <xref rid="t02" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). There was significant variation in forecasted estimates across the 50 state park systems under each of these scenarios; this is a product of the large variation in expected temperature changes across the states.
