<p class="p">The first scenario we explored assumed temperatures will stay constant at 2017 levels, but attendance to each state park system will continue to change at an annual rate consistent with trends observed between 1984 and 2017. Across all 50 state park systems, annual attendance increased by an average of 6.66% per year over this 33-y period of time. If historical rates of annual changes in attendance remain consistent with observed trends, average operating expenditures per acre in 2050 will be $5,380.29 per acre; this is an order of magnitude greater than current average operating expenditures ($432.00 per acre).</p>
