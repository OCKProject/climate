<p class="p">Results from the baseline model revealed that attendance, capital expenditures, revenue, and labor are all significantly related to the operating expenditures of America’s state park systems (
 <xref rid="t01" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Summing the estimated coefficients across these outputs yields a value of 0.768, suggesting, by-and-large, the state park systems are doing a good job at operating in a cost-minimizing fashion. A value of 1.0 would indicate constant returns to scale across all of the state park systems. The average marginal effects for each of the output factors from 1984–2017 are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>. Changes in attendance yield the greatest increases in operating expenditures; on average, a 1% increase in attendance costs a state park system an additional $26.16 per acre. As visitation to a state park system increases, managers have to utilize more resources to enforce rules and regulations, maintain facilities, and provide for visitor services. Labor ($10.12), revenue ($7.78), and capital expenditures ($6.08) are less elastic relative to attendance.
