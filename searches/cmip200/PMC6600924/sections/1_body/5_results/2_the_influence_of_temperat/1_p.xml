<p class="p">Results from the reestimated model, including state-specific climate covariates, are shown in 
 <xref rid="t01" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. All of the output factors were still significantly related to operating expenditures; a recalculation of average marginal effects revealed they were consistent with those previously estimated. The model also revealed annual mean temperature was positively and significantly related to operating expenditures. The warmer the year, the more it costs to manage a state park system. This finding is logical given that the majority of state park systems experience seasonal variations in the types of activities they support and the amount of parkland they actively manage. On warmer years, state park systems appear to be supporting high-use activities (typically those occurring in the summer) or keeping parks open for longer periods of time. The average marginal effect for changes in temperature revealed that for every 1% increase in annual mean temperatures, operating expenditures are expected to increase by $11.51 per acre. Across all 50 state park systems, we observed substantial variation in cost sensitivities to increasing (or decreasing) temperatures (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>). The operating expenditures of state park systems at lower latitudes are more sensitive to increases in temperatures relative to those at higher latitudes. Of the five significant covariates, attendance had the largest average marginal effect on operating expenditures for most states; however, temperature had the greatest effect on operating expenditures for Alaska, Texas, Louisiana, and Florida.
