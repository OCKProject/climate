<p class="p">Visitation to parks and protected areas across the United States has increased substantially over the past half-century; despite slight declines in the 1990s and early 2000s, many parks are now experiencing record high visitation (

 <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>). This has led to many well-publicized claims that the nation’s national and state parks are being “loved to death.” Annual visits to the nation’s national parks, for example, increased by 33% from 1984 to 2017 (
 <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>); current visitation is over 330 million. By comparison, attendance across the nation’s 50 state park systems increased 25.6% over the same period of time, with an all-time high of 807 million visits in 2017 (

Concerns about increases in visitation to national parks frequently make national news, particularly in times of crisis such as federal government shutdowns. However, there is a dearth of information about visitation to state parklands across the country; despite the fact they see nearly 2.5 times as many annual visits as national parks. Currently, there are a total of 8,292 individual management units in operation within one of the nation’s 50 state governments (
