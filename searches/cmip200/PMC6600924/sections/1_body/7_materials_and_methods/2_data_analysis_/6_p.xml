<p class="p">We forecasted operating expenditures under four different scenarios. The first scenario assumes the annual attendance to each state park system will continue to grow (or decline) at the same average annual rate that it has over the period of observation (1984â€“2017) while annual mean temperatures remain constant at 2017 levels. The subsequent scenarios assume attendance will remain constant at levels reported in 2017, but statewide annual mean temperatures will increase following the RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 greenhouse gas emissions trajectories. Forecasted operating expenditures were derived by calculating the percentage change in both annual mean temperatures and attendance between 2017 and 2050, and then multiplying this value by the previously estimated state-specific marginal effect.</p>
