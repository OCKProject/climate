<p class="p">We tested the exogeneity of each independent variable, excluding the precipitation and temperature variables, using random-effects instrumental variable estimators (
 <xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>). This involved first fitting pooled ordinary least-squares regressions in which each independent variable was regressed against a suite of instrumental variables consisting of all other outputs of production. We saved the residuals generated by these models and subsequently included them in augmented equations, which regressed operating expenditures on the outputs of production; these models were specified with SEs clustered by state. We failed to reject the null hypotheses that each independent variable was exogenous (
