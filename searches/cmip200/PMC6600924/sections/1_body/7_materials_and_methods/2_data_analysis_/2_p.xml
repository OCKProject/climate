 </inline-formula>, which includes both random disturbance and a one-sided “stochastic” disturbance representing inefficiency. Before estimation, all monetary variables were adjusted to 2017 dollars using the US Consumer Price Index. Additionally, all of the variables were normalized by the acreage of each state park system (for each year) and transformed into their natural log. We fit the model using Greene’s (
 <xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>) true random-effects specification, which allows us to differentiate time-varying inefficiency from unit-specific time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity. Time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity may be present within the data given environmental and policy contexts vary notably across the 50 states [e.g., the ecological characteristics of a state have been shown to influence the operating expenditures of state park systems (
 <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>)]. After fitting the baseline model specified above, we refit the model including the historical climate data as additional independent variables. We checked the robustness of coefficients estimated with the true random-effects specification by comparing them against estimates generated by a variety of other specifications commonly used to fit time-varying stochastic frontier models (
