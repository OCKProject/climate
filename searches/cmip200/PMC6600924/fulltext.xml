Managing these lands for human enjoyment comes at a cost, however. Management requires capital to ensure visitors&#x02019; health and safety, to provide infrastructure and services that facilitate desired outdoor recreation activities, and to protect natural and cultural resources. By constructing and analyzing a dataset describing the operations of all 50 state park systems in the United States, we were able to determine the operating costs of state park systems will likely increase substantially in the coming decades. These increases are largely attributable to continued increases in attendance (visitor-hours) and, to a much lesser extent, climate change.</p></abstract><abstract><p>This research examines how the operating expenditures of America&#x02019;s state park systems will be affected by a continued growth in attendance consistent with observed trends as well as potential climate futures. We construct a longitudinal panel dataset (1984&#x02013;2017) describing the operations and characteristics of all 50 state park systems. These data are analyzed with a time-varying stochastic frontier model. Estimates from the model are used to forecast operating expenditures to midcentury under four different scenarios. The first scenario assumes annual attendance within each state park system will continue to grow (or decline) at the same average annual rate that it has over the period of observation. The subsequent scenarios assume statewide annual mean temperatures will increase following the RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 greenhouse gas emissions trajectories. Operating expenditures under a scenario where annual growth in attendance stays consistent with observed trends are forecasted to increase 756% by midcentury; this is an order of magnitude larger than projected expenditures under any of the climate scenarios. The future climate change scenarios yielded increases in operating expenditures between 25% (RCP2.6) and 61% (RCP8.5) by 2050. Attendance is the single largest factor affecting the operations of America&#x02019;s state park systems, dwarfing the influence of climate change, which is significant and nontrivial. The future of America&#x02019;s state park systems will depend upon increased support from state legislatures, as well as management actions that generate funds for the maintenance of existing infrastructure and facilities, and the provisioning of services.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>climate change</kwd><kwd>stochastic frontier</kwd><kwd>outdoor recreation</kwd><kwd>public lands</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="gs1"><funding-source id="sp1">National Association of State Park Directors</funding-source><award-id rid="sp1">N/A</award-id><principal-award-recipient>Jordan W.

These areas have also shaped the nation&#x02019;s identity as pioneers of preservation and conservation, leaving a legacy that many other nations around the world have aspired to over the past century. Managing parks and protected areas for human enjoyment and benefits comes at a cost, however. Management requires capital to ensure visitors&#x02019; health and safety and to maintain infrastructure and services that facilitate desired outdoor recreation activities. Importantly, capital is also required to take management actions that minimize the environmental disturbance visitors can have on natural landscapes and cultural resources. As the demand for outdoor recreation continues to grow across the country, so too do the costs associated with managing outdoor recreation destinations.</p><p>Visitation to parks and protected areas across the United States has increased substantially over the past half-century; despite slight declines in the 1990s and early 2000s, many parks are now experiencing record high visitation (<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). This has led to many well-publicized claims that the nation&#x02019;s national and state parks are being &#x0201c;loved to death.&#x0201d; Annual visits to the nation&#x02019;s national parks, for example, increased by 33% from 1984 to 2017 (<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>); current visitation is over 330 million. By comparison, attendance across the nation&#x02019;s 50 state park systems increased 25.6% over the same period of time, with an all-time high of 807 million visits in 2017 (<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Concerns about increases in visitation to national parks frequently make national news, particularly in times of crisis such as federal government shutdowns. However, there is a dearth of information about visitation to state parklands across the country; despite the fact they see nearly 2.5 times as many annual visits as national parks. Currently, there are a total of 8,292 individual management units in operation within one of the nation&#x02019;s 50 state governments (<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). These state parklands generate over 2 billion hours of nature recreation annually, about a third of all US nature recreation (<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p>Increased visitation to parks and protected areas often stresses the capacities of park managers to ensure visitor health, safety, and enjoyment. Increased visitation also often results in greater, or more severe, environmental disturbances on-site as well as new disturbances in adjacent areas that visitors are using to avoid crowded trails and waterways (<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). All of these consequences result in increased management costs. It is unclear whether elected officials across the country are willing to prioritize these costs, and support them through federal and state appropriations dedicated to managing outdoor recreation. For example, state funding allocated to managing outdoor recreation through state park systems has declined from a high of $3.74 billion (inflation adjusted) in 2006 to $2.59 billion in 2017 (<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p>To compound concerns over attendance levels that are rapidly outpacing appropriated budgets, there are a wealth of data suggesting climate change, and more particularly increases in temperatures, will positively influence visitation rates (<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Research specific to the United States has projected annual attendance levels to parks and protected areas will increase as temperatures rise (<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>Despite concerns over both increased visitation to parks and protected areas across the United States and the influence of climate change on visitation, no previous research has tied these trends to the actual costs associated with managing parks and protected areas. The purposes of this research are to (<italic>i</italic>) determine whether observed attendance and climate have influenced the operating costs of the nation&#x02019;s 50 state park systems, and (<italic>ii</italic>) project future operating costs out to midcentury for each of the state park systems under different scenarios focused on historically consistent projected attendance levels as well as different greenhouse gas emissions trajectories. Our analysis uses state-level data for each of the nation&#x02019;s 50 state park systems from 1984 to 2017. We fit these panel time-series data with a time-varying stochastic frontier model and then link the derived estimates to state-level attendance projections that are consistent with trends observed over the past 34 y. We also use the model-derived estimates to project the operating expenditures required by each state park system at midcentury under three different greenhouse gas emissions trajectories (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5).</p><sec sec-type="results" id="s1"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2"><title>The Cost Efficiency of America&#x02019;s State Park Systems.</title><p>Results from the baseline model revealed that attendance, capital expenditures, revenue, and labor are all significantly related to the operating expenditures of America&#x02019;s state park systems (<xref rid="t01" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Summing the estimated coefficients across these outputs yields a value of 0.768, suggesting, by-and-large, the state park systems are doing a good job at operating in a cost-minimizing fashion. A value of 1.0 would indicate constant returns to scale across all of the state park systems. The average marginal effects for each of the output factors from 1984&#x02013;2017 are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>. Changes in attendance yield the greatest increases in operating expenditures; on average, a 1% increase in attendance costs a state park system an additional $26.16 per acre. As visitation to a state park system increases, managers have to utilize more resources to enforce rules and regulations, maintain facilities, and provide for visitor services. Labor ($10.12), revenue ($7.78), and capital expenditures ($6.08) are less elastic relative to attendance.</p><table-wrap id="t01" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Results of the stochastic frontier model fit to the longitudinal panel dataset (1984&#x02013;2017)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Variable</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Coef.<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tfn1"><sup>&#x02020;</sup></xref></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SE<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tfn2"><sup>&#x02021;</sup></xref></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Avg. marginal effect, $<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tfn3"><sup>&#x000a7;</sup></xref></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="4" rowspan="1">Base cost inefficiency model</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;<italic>ln</italic> Attendance (visitor-hours)/acre</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.255***</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.014</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">26.16</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;<italic>ln</italic> Capital expenditures/acre<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tfn2"><sup>&#x02021;</sup></xref></td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.027***</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.004</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.08</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;<italic>ln</italic> Revenue/acre<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tfn2"><sup>&#x02021;</sup></xref></td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.064***</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.007</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.78</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;<italic>ln</italic> Labor (person-hours)/acre<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tfn3"><sup>&#x000a7;</sup></xref></td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.422***</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.015</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">10.12</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Constant</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.087***</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.062</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;<italic>U</italic><sup><italic>&#x003c3;</italic></sup> constant</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;3.407***</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.092</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;<italic>V</italic><sup><italic>&#x003c3;</italic></sup> constant</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;3.479***</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.059</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;&#x003b8;

The model also revealed annual mean temperature was positively and significantly related to operating expenditures. The warmer the year, the more it costs to manage a state park system. This finding is logical given that the majority of state park systems experience seasonal variations in the types of activities they support and the amount of parkland they actively manage. On warmer years, state park systems appear to be supporting high-use activities (typically those occurring in the summer) or keeping parks open for longer periods of time. The average marginal effect for changes in temperature revealed that for every 1% increase in annual mean temperatures, operating expenditures are expected to increase by $11.51 per acre.

In 2017, the annual operating expenditures for all 50 state park systems was $2.59 billion dollars, $170 million dollars more than the total operating budget for the US National Park Service (<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). This research examined how these costs will be affected by a continued growth in attendance consistent with observed trends and potential climate futures. Within the nation&#x02019;s state park systems, the cost of providing services to ensure visitors&#x02019; health and safety and maintaining outdoor recreation infrastructure (trails, trailheads, campgrounds, etc.) is affected by the amount of demand placed on those systems (i.e., attendance) and annual mean temperatures.</p><p>Demand-induced costs are to be expected. As a park system experiences more visitor-days, management must dedicate additional resources to managing the outdoor recreation amenities offered by their state park system. For state park systems that manage more &#x0201c;natural&#x0201d; settings like trails, rivers, lakes, and campgrounds, as use increases trails and roads need to be maintained more frequently, restroom facilities need to be cleaned more often, and more environmental monitoring is needed to ensure sites are not being degraded beyond acceptable levels. Demand-induced costs are also seen in state park systems that offer &#x0201c;developed&#x0201d; outdoor recreation activities like lodges, golf courses, and ski areas. However, for these systems, demand-induced costs are more likely to be caused by providing basic services (access, sanitation, and safety) as well as maintaining equipment (e.g., vehicles, ski lifts, etc.) and paying overhead costs (e.g., utilities). Our analysis revealed that attendance had the most elastic influence on operating expenditures, with a 1% increase in attendance inducing an average of $26.16 per acre of operating costs, an effect substantially larger than the other output factors we investigated. There is substantial variation in cost sensitivities to shifts in attendance with some states like Rhode Island ($47.98 per acre), Oregon ($43.00 per acre), and Hawaii ($42.59 per acre) seeing the largest increases in operating costs as attendance fluctuates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>). This variation is likely attributable to the amount and types of recreation infrastructure in different state park systems. Ancillary analysis revealed a significant and positive correlation between the extent to which a state park system was focused on &#x0201c;developed&#x0201d; outdoor recreation and sensitivities to fluctuations in attendance (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s6"><italic>Materials and Methods</italic></xref>).</p><p>Before this investigation, the relationship between the costs of maintaining parks and protected areas and climate had not been examined. Research into other public goods and services, such as health care, agriculture, and water resources, has found that increases in temperatures may impose additional operational costs (<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Our investigation determined temperature, but not precipitation, is positively related with operating costs. Over the past 34 y, we estimate that for every 1% increase in annual mean temperature, America&#x02019;s state park systems have seen an $11.51 increase in operating expenditures per acre. We found the operating expenditures of state park systems at lower latitudes are more sensitive to increases in temperatures relative to those at higher latitudes. This is likely attributable to the fact parks in warmer climates are more costly to manage (<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). While this is true, the more rapid rates of warming expected at northern latitudes (<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) may result in warming having a larger actual impact in northern states.</p><p>The operating expenditures of four state park systems in particular&#x02014;Alaska, Texas, Louisiana, and Florida&#x02014;are more sensitive to annual mean temperatures than any other variable we examined, including attendance. For Alaska, this may be the product of managers having to maintain infrastructure that deteriorates more rapidly as freeze/thaw events become more common, combined with the limited capacity of the system to experience large increases in attendance during the winter months in which daylight is limited. By comparison, Texas, Louisiana, and Florida may be more sensitive to annual mean temperatures given that their low-lying parklands require more maintenance as they become inundated more frequently due to sea level rise (<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p><p>Across most of the country, future climate change will result in a continued expansion of the high-use summer season (<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>); this expansion will be accompanied by increased operating costs. For the three greenhouse gas emissions trajectories we examined (in which all other output factors were held constant), the average cost of maintaining outdoor recreation opportunities provided by state park systems will increase between $149 per acre (RCP2.6) and $238.28 per acre (RCP8.5). Aggregating these costs across all 50 state park systems, we expect total operating expenditures between $6.99 billion (RCP2.6) and $9.00 billion (RCP8.5) by 2050 (<xref rid="t02" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). These findings are logical, as warming results in state park system managers keeping their systems open for longer periods of time and, for some geographic locations, having to mitigate the undesirable impacts rising temperatures can have on infrastructure and natural resources.</p><p>It is important to note that our analysis only captures the climate-related costs incurred solely by state park systems; it does not capture other costs that may be borne by other state and federal entities aside from state parks. As an example, rising temperatures will likely increase the frequency and severity of fire on state parklands; the costs associated with suppressing these fires is incurred by state and federal fire agencies. Our estimates should be interpreted as a lower bound of total cost of climate-related impacts to state parklands.</p><p>While operating expenditures are expected to increase substantially under any of the plausible future climate scenarios, the magnitude of these increases are small relative to those expected under a scenario in which historical attendance trends (1984&#x02013;2017) persist until midcentury. Under this scenario, operating expenditures would reach $47.88 billion by 2050, more than five times those expected under the RCP8.5 scenario (<xref rid="t02" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Given historical attendance trends and a projected increase in the US population by 19.5% from 2017 to 2050 (<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), we believe these future attendance increases to state parks are plausible, if not likely. We doubt the operating expenditures of the nation&#x02019;s state park systems will approach $50 billion given that state legislatures often prioritize other public services over environmental conservation and the provisioning of outdoor recreation opportunities (<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Currently, an average of only 0.16% of the states&#x02019; operating budgets are appropriated for the operation of state park systems [range: 0.05 [Wisconsin] &#x02013; 0.54 [South Dakota] (<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>)].</p><p>Our results suggest a dire future for America&#x02019;s state park systems. Attendance has consistently grown over the past three and a half decades. If this trend continues into the future, state legislatures will face very difficult decisions about how to ensure their publics can continue to receive the social and cultural ecosystem services provided by parklands. If the states fail to increase annual appropriations to their states&#x02019; park systems, specifically mandating those funds support the maintenance of existing infrastructure, facilities, and services, the quality of outdoor recreation opportunities and the environmental quality of state parklands will decline.</p><p>A scenario that is likely to play out in many states will be an increased demand for state park systems to generate enough funds through entrance fees, permits, donations, and other sources to supplement state-appropriated operating budgets. Many state park systems have already begun to take management actions specifically for the purpose of revenue generation. For example, both Colorado and Wyoming have implemented state park entrance fee increases in 2019, with Wyoming implementing a peak-use pricing scheme (<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). More innovative solutions include statewide policy changes such as excise taxes on outdoor recreation equipment (<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), the direct funding of individual state park units by corporations within the outdoor recreation industry (<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), the selling of unique license plates that serve as annual entrance passes (<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), and partnering with local communities in comanagement arrangements (<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).</p><p>The future of America&#x02019;s state park systems will depend upon the continued, and likely increased, support from state legislatures as well as management actions and policy solutions that generate funds that can be used specifically for the maintenance of existing infrastructure, facilities, and services. More research is needed to determine which management actions (e.g., increasing fees, implementing peak-use pricing, etc.) or policy changes (e.g., excise taxes, etc.) state park visitors and the general public are willing to support. Most states will likely need a combination of both management actions and policy changes to maintain the quality and services currently offered by their park systems. In the search for this appropriate mix of management actions and policy solutions, we urge state legislatures, state park system directors, and other decision makers to not price-out large portions of their constituents who are unable, or unwilling, to support park maintenance through increased fees. Doing so is likely to displace these individuals or prohibit them from obtaining the benefits provided by parklands (<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).

Each individual area is managed for one or more purposes, depending up the enabling legislation that established the area. These management units consist primarily of lands designated as &#x0201c;state parks&#x0201d; (2,184 units; 26.3% of all units); however, they also consist of lands designated as natural areas (827 units; 10.0%), recreation areas (800 units; 9.6%), state forests (648 units; 7.8%), state fish and wildlife areas (600 units; 7.2%), state historical areas (581 units; 7.0%), scientific areas (105 units; 1.3%), and environmental education areas (24 units; 0.3%).

Operating expenditures are recurring payments made for goods and services to operate and maintain a state park system. Funds for operating expenditures come from state general funds, dedicated funds, federal funds, park-generated revenue, and other funds such as interagency transfers and money generated through temporary leases. Operating expenditures do not include labor-related expenditures (i.e., salaries and wages); this information is reported independently during data collection each year. Attendance is the total amount of visitor-hours spent in state parks; this value was estimated by multiplying the total count of day and overnight visits to both fee and nonfee areas by an average visit time of 3.0 h [this value is derived by dividing the 2.2 billion hours of outdoor recreation that all 50 state park systems generate annually (<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) by the average annual attendance rate across all 50 state park systems over the past 34 y (734,252,207)]. Capital expenditures are nonrecurring expenditures used to improve the productive capacity of a state park system. Most often, these are for land acquisition, park improvements, and new construction projects. Revenue is money generated from use fees and charges; this includes entrance fees, camping fees, cabin/cottage rentals, lodge rentals, group facility rentals, restaurants, concessions, beaches/pools, golf courses, and other sources such as donations. Labor is the total amount of employee-hours spent managing a state park system; this value was derived by taking the total count of full-time, part-time, and seasonal employees who maintain, operate, and protect a state park system, and multiplying it by 2,080 h per year.</p><p>We collected historic climate data for each state park system from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&#x02019;s National Centers for Environmental Information program (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov" xlink:show="new">https://www.ncei.noaa.gov</ext-link>).

Average marginal effects are the monetary changes in operating expenditures corresponding to a 1% increase in each independent variable; they are calculated as <inline-formula><mml:math id="i4"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">x</mml:mi><mml:mo>&#x000af;</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">&#x003b2;</mml:mi></mml:msup><mml:mo>&#x000d7;</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">ln</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">x</mml:mi><mml:mo>&#x000af;</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><mml:math id="i5"><mml:mrow><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">x</mml:mi><mml:mo>&#x000af;</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> is the state-specific mean of each variable.</p><p>We conducted an ancillary analysis on the estimated state-specific average marginal effects, correlating them with Davis&#x02019; measure of the extent to which a state park system offers &#x0201c;developed&#x0201d; outdoor recreation opportunities (ref. <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, table 7). The correlation was positive and significant (<italic>r</italic> = 0.30, <italic>t</italic> = 2.19, <italic>P</italic> = 0.03).</p><p>We forecasted operating expenditures under four different scenarios. The first scenario assumes the annual attendance to each state park system will continue to grow (or decline) at the same average annual rate that it has over the period of observation (1984&#x02013;2017) while annual mean temperatures remain constant at 2017 levels. The subsequent scenarios assume attendance will remain constant at levels reported in 2017, but statewide annual mean temperatures will increase following the RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 greenhouse gas emissions trajectories. Forecasted operating expenditures were derived by calculating the percentage change in both annual mean temperatures and attendance between 2017 and 2050, and then multiplying this value by the previously estimated state-specific marginal effect.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data"><label>Supplementary File</label><media xlink:href="pnas.1902314116.sapp.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was funded by the National Science Foundation (Award 1633756), the National Association of State Park Directors, and the Institute of Outdoor Recreation and Tourism at Utah State University.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors declare no conflict of interest.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>This article is a PNAS Direct Submission.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>Data deposition: Data are available at Utah State University Digital Commons (DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http:dx.doi.org.10.26078/1k8r-a972">10.26078/1k8r-a972</ext-link>).</p></fn><fn fn-type="supplementary-material"><p>This article contains supporting information online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1902314116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new">www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1902314116/-/DCSupplemental</ext-link>.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Pergams</surname><given-names>O.
