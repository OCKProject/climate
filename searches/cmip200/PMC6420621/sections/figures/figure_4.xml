  <p class="p">Comparison between benchmark decadal hindcast skill and initial conditions-based hindcast skill. The results are for 4-year mean terrestrial water storage (TWS) averaged over global major river basins. Here, the CMIP5/TWS benchmark hindcasts (
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>–
   <bold class="bold">d</bold>) were obtained by using the TWS skill elasticity analysis with decadal climate forecast skill specified by CMIP5 multi-model-predicted precipitation, while initial conditions-based hindcasts (
   <bold class="bold">e</bold>–
   <bold class="bold">h</bold>) were from ensemble streamflow prediction (ESP) simulations. The dotted regions represent river basins with benchmark skill that is significantly (
   <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) higher than ESP skill, estimated by using bootstrapping 1000 times. Maps were created by using the NCAR Command Language (Version 6.3.0) [Software]. (2016). Boulder, Colorado: UCAR/NCAR/CISL/TDD. 10.5065/D6WD3XH5
