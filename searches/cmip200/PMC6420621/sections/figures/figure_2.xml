   <bold class="bold">d</bold> decadal climate forecasts (DCFs) and 
   <bold class="bold">e</bold>–
   <bold class="bold">h</bold> initial hydrological conditions (IHCs). For example, a value of 0.8 represents that 100% improvement in the accuracy of DCFs or IHCs (e.g., Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) increases from 0.2 to 0.4) would result in 80% increase in TWS forecast skill (e.g., NSE increases from 0.3 to 0.54). Maps were created by using the NCAR Command Language (Version 6.3.0) [Software]. (2016). Boulder, Colorado: UCAR/NCAR/CISL/TDD. 10.5065/D6WD3XH5
