  <p class="p">Decadal hindcast skill for basin-averaged precipitation. Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) values were calculated for CMIP5 multi-model-predicted 4-year mean precipitation averaged over global major river basins at different lead times (
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>â€“
   <bold class="bold">d</bold>). The anomaly of CMIP5 model-predicted precipitation to CMIP5 climatology was used to calculate NSE, to circumvent the bias in the interpretation of results. Maps were created by using the NCAR Command Language (Version 6.3.0) [Software]. (2016). Boulder, Colorado: UCAR/NCAR/CISL/TDD. 10.5065/D6WD3XH5
