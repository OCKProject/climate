<p id="Par10" class="p">With the skill elasticity framework, we can estimate the decadal forecast skill for TWS given a DCFs skill or IHCs skill (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). For example, when the NSE skill for meteorological forcings is equal to 0.2 and IHCs are perfect, the TWS prediction skill is about 0.25 for the Amazon basin at lead 1–4 years (Fig.
