<p id="Par12" class="p">After obtaining the actual DCFs skill based on the CMIP5 hindcasts analysis above, we can estimate the benchmark skill, which considers skill both in IHCs and DCFs comprehensively, for the decadal prediction of TWS by using the elasticity framework. At 1–4 years lead, the benchmark skill is beyond 0.7 over 25% basins (8 in 32 basins) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4a</xref>), which are located in high-latitude (e.g., Volga, Yenisei and Lena) or semiarid regions (e.g., Niger and Nile) where memory of IHCs is important for hydrological predictability. As forecast lead time increases, the benchmark skill averaged over the 32 major river basins decreases from 0.51 (0.67 for correlation) at 1–4 years lead (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4a</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">8a</xref>) to 0.25 (0.42), 0.19 (0.30), and 0.11 (0.17) at leads of 3–6 years, 5–8 years, and 7–10 years, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4b–d</xref> and Supplementary Figs. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">8b</xref>–
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">d</xref>). Compared with ESP forecast skill, which has been used for the benchmark in most hydrological applications (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4e–h</xref> and Supplementary Figs. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">8e</xref>–
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">h</xref>), the new benchmark skill is significantly (

The increases are more obvious at longer lead time, with significant NSE (correlation) increases over 31% (56%), 44% (66%), and 47% (59%) basins at leads of 3–6, 5–8, 7–10 years.
