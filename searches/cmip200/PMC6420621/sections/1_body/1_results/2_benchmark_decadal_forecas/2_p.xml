<p id="Par11" class="p">To estimate the actual decadal forecast skill for meteorological forcings, ten CMIP5 models were selected (see Methods for details). The NSE values for the multi-model ensemble mean precipitation averaged over global major river basins at different lead times are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>. For the 1–4 years lead, there are skillful predictions (NSE &gt; 0 and correlation larger than 0.5) over the Amazon basin in South America, the Shatt el Arab basin in Middle East, the Ob and Syr-Darya basins in central Asia, and the Lena basin in Far East (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">7a</xref>). The predictions are also skillful over certain regions even at long leads, such as the North American and high-latitude river basins at the 7–10 years lead (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b–d</xref>). The prediction skill does not necessarily decrease over leads, which might be caused by the perturbations from external forcings
