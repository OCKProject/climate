<p id="Par9" class="p">Given a range of skill in IHCs or DCFs, the corresponding TWS forecast skill elasticity can be estimated (see Methods for details) for each river basin at each forecast lead. The elasticity can quantity the contribution of improved skill in predictability sources (e.g., IHCs or DCFs) to the improvement of TWS prediction. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> shows skill elasticity over 32 global major river basins with forecast lead times from 1–4 years to 7–10 years. As the forecast lead time increases, the IHCs skill elasticity decreases but the DCFs skill elasticity increases. At shorter leads (e.g., 1–4 years), the IHCs’ skill elasticity is higher than DCFs’ skill elasticity over half of the river basins, especially in high-latitude and arid and semiarid regions (e.g., Yenisei, Ob, Mackenzie, Niger, and Nelson) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a, e</xref>). This suggests that increasing the accuracy in IHCs can bring more benefit to TWS decadal prediction in these regions. On the contrary, DCFs dominate the predictability in humid regions. For instance, the DCFs skill elasticity is consistently higher than the IHCs skill elasticity for the Amazon and Yangtze basins even for the first 4 years forecasts, but the IHCs skill elasticity can be dominant up to 5 years over the Yenisei basin (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">5</xref>). Averaged over the major river basins, the DCFs NSE (correlation) elasticities increase from 0.48 (0.36) to 0.81 (0.73) as lead time increases from 1–4 years to 7–10 years, while the IHCs NSE (correlation) elasticities decrease from 0.55 (0.36) to 0.19 (0.13) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">6</xref>). DCFs elasticities are larger than one over 15% (22% for correlation) of the basins at 7–10 years lead, suggesting great benefits for advancing TWS long-lead prediction by improving decadal climate prediction.
