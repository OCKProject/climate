<p id="Par7" class="p">To analyze TWS prediction skill with different levels of accuracy in IHCs and DCFs, we applied the ESP and rev-ESP methods by resampling

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">23</xref>
 </sup> the ensemble simulations (see Methods and Supplementary Figs. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>–
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref> for details). The ESP and rev-ESP experiments were carried out by performing Community Land Model version 4.5 (CLM4.5)

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>
 </sup> simulations. In these experiments, the DCFs include atmospheric temperature, humidity, wind and pressure near the surface, radiation, and precipitation, while IHCs represent the initial states of TWS, soil moisture and soil temperature, etc. Along the 
 <italic class="italic">x</italic>-axis in each panel in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>, the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE; see Methods for details), a metric of skill for IHCs, increases from the left to the right with the ending point, ESP (representing perfect initial conditions together with climatological DCFs). Along the 
 <italic class="italic">y</italic>-axis, the DCFs NSE increases from bottom to top with the ending point, rev-ESP (representing perfect meteorological forcings (DCFs) together with climatological IHCs). The upper right corner for each panel shows a perfect TWS forecast (both IHCs and DCFs are perfect) with a NSE value of one, while the lower left corners (climo, abbreviation for climatology) show forecast skill based on climatological information only, resulting in NSE values of zero or less (Fig.
