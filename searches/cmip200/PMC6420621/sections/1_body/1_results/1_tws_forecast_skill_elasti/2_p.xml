<p id="Par8" class="p">As the forecast lead time increases from 1–4 years to 7–10 years (here, 1–4 years lead prediction represents 4-year average prediction with 0-year lead, 2–5 years lead prediction represents that with 1-year lead, and so on), the increasingly horizontal contours show that the NSE skill becomes less sensitive to the IHCs uncertainty and is more dominated by DCFs, as the prediction becomes more of a boundary value than an initial value challenge (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). For instance, when the DCFs NSE is about 0.5 at 5–8 years lead, there is no obvious improvement for TWS prediction even if the IHCs NSE increases from 0 to 1 for the Amazon basin (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1c</xref>). However, at 1–4 years lead (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref>), increasing IHCs NSE results in significant improvement of TWS prediction, given the same DCFs NSE (e.g., 0.5). The insensitivity of TWS skill to the increasing skill in IHCs is more obvious for the Amazon basin in the humid area (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a–d</xref>) than the other two basins (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1e–l</xref>), while the TWS skill sensitivity to increasing IHCs skill for the Yenisei basin in the semiarid area (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1i–l</xref>, see Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref> for the locations) is the largest. This suggests that increasing IHCs skill has significant potential benefit to improve decadal prediction of TWS over the Yenisei basin, while the control for IHCs drops quickly in the first few years for the Amazon basin. The results for the Yangtze basin, a semi-humid river basin, fall between the humid and semiarid basins (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Similar characteristics for skill variations are also found by using correlation as the metric (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">4</xref>).
