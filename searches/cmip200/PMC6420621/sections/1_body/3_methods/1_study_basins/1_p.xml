 </sup>. The selected 32 river basins are the focus of the Global Energy and Water EXchanges (GEWEX) project, representing a broad range of climate and land cover conditions (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>). Three basins (i.e., Amazon, Yangtze, and Yenisei) were selected to illustrate details of variable uncertainty in IHCs and DCFs, and their corresponding TWS predictability over different basins. The Amazon basin is located in the low latitude with an area of 5,854,000 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>, where the annual rainfall is abundant. The Yangtze basin is located in the middle latitude, covering 1,794,000 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> where the amount of rainfall is less than the Amazon, and there are significant interannual variations for precipitation due to the East Asian Summer Monsoon activities. The Yenisei basin is mainly located in Russia, a high-latitude basin with an area of 2,579,000 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> and a continental subarctic climate. In this study, all the statistics were calculated based on basin average values.
