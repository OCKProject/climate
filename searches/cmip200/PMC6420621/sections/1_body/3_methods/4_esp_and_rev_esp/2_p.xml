<p id="Par20" class="p">A continuous CLM4.5 control simulation (CTL) was driven by CRUNCEP data during 1901–2010 to provide the IHCs and verification data, viewed as a true situation. The first 50-year simulations during 1901–1950 were used as land surface model spin-up. Similar to CMIP5 decadal climate hindcast experiments, the decadal hydrological hindcasts were designed to start every 5 years from 1951 to 2001 by using IHCs obtained from CLM4.5 CTL experiment, and were run over 10-year periods. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>, both ESP and rev-ESP simulations were performed. The ESP-type simulations, which we regard as real decadal hydrological hindcasts based on IHCs alone, have ten ensemble members with the same (true) initial hydrological conditions from CTL experiments but different meteorological forcings from 10-year samples overlapped every 5 years during 1951–2001 (excluding that started from the target year).

 </sup> simulations have a set of initial conditions sampled from the study period (excluding the target years) but with the same (true) meteorological forcings.
