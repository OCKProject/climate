 </sup>) observed meteorological forcings data was used to drive the land surface model, and was used as a reference to assess the performance of precipitation predictions from CMIP5 models. The dataset is a widely used gauge-based product, and its monthly precipitation values are the same as the CRU data. As compared with other precipitation products based on gauge-observation or satellite-estimates, including CPC, GPCC, GPCP, and PREC, regional differences in precipitation magnitude do exist between CRU and other products (Supplementary Fig.

However, to be consistent with ESP and rev-ESP experiments for elasticity and benchmark skill estimation which are based on CRUNCEP-driven CLM4.5 simulations, we kept using CRUNCEP as a reference for validating CMIP5 decadal prediction of precipitation. The time series of decadal precipitation forecasts along with the time series of observed precipitation for each river basin are shown in Supplementary Fig.
