 </sup>. IHCs can be significant sources of hydrological predictability even at interannual to decadal scales. Based on the information in IHCs alone, TWS over one third of the world’s land areas could be skillfully predicted 2–5 years ahead, especially over semiarid regions such as northern China, southern Africa, and the Middle East, where the hydrological variability is not negligible and the hydrological anomalies can persist for a long time

 </sup>. Besides IHCs, the success of decadal climate forecasts (DCFs) determines the skill of TWS prediction at long leads. DCFs rely on the understanding of the low frequency of climate variability (e.g., Pacific Decadal Oscillation and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation), natural forcings such as volcanic activities, and human-induced climate change through the emissions of anthropogenic aerosols and greenhouse gases. These internal and external factors affect temperature and precipitation through complicated ocean-atmosphere teleconnections and cloud-aerosol-radiation interactions. Decadal prediction has been regarded as one of the seven grand challenges by the World Climate Research Program, with gradual improvement during past 20 years

 </sup>, have been launched to investigate decadal climate predictability and variability, and to provide experimental quasi-real-time decadal prediction. Given the progress in utilizing the memory in IHCs and the information in DCFs, the era for decadal hydrological prediction is expected in the near future.
