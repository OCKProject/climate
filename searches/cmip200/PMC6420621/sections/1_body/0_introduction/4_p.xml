<p id="Par6" class="p">However, whether such an elasticity framework is applicable for quantifying potential benefit of improving IHCs and DCFs for decadal TWS prediction over global major river basins needs further investigation. In addition, there is an opportunity to obtain a benchmark forecast skill by incorporating the-state-of-the-art information of DCFs from the fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) decadal hindcasts
