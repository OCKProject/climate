<p id="Par5" class="p">To distinguish the effects of IHCs and meteorological forcings (e.g., DCFs) on the hydrological forecasts, simulations based on the ensemble streamflow prediction (ESP) method that uses accurate (deterministic) IHCs but climatological ensemble meteorological forcings, were compared with simulations based on the reverse ESP (rev-ESP) method that uses accurate (deterministic) meteorological forcings but climatological ensemble IHCs

 </sup>. Comparing the performances of ESP and rev-ESP simulations enables estimation of the influence of IHCs relative to that of boundary conditions—e.g., DCFs

 </sup>. In past demonstrations and applications, this framework only considered perfect-model experiments—that is, treating IHCs (i.e., ESP) or meteorological forcings (i.e., rev-ESP) as observations for the purpose of determining relative errors. However, in reality, there are variable uncertainties in IHCs and climate forecasts depending on the characteristics of the hydroclimate system. Therefore, the concept of forecast skill elasticity framework has been recently proposed to investigate the streamflow predictability at seasonal time scale

 <xref rid="Equ4" ref-type="" class="xref">4</xref> in Methods) represent the gradients in hydrological forecast skill (e.g., streamflow forecast skill) relative to gradients in accuracy for predictors (e.g., IHCs or meteorological forcings), hence a larger elasticity of a predictability source means a larger contribution to the improvement of the hydrological prediction given an improved skill in the predictability source.
