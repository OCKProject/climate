<p id="Par13" class="p">Decadal TWS prediction can be influenced by both IHCs and DCFs. With the improvement in DCFs, a more skillful TWS prediction is expected. In this study, we provide a benchmark skill for TWS decadal prediction by comprehensively considering skill of both DCFs from CMIP5 decadal prediction models and perfect IHCs through an elasticity framework. Compared with the ESP that is regarded as a benchmark for most hydrological forecasting studies, our proposed benchmark significantly increases skill (NSE) over 25% and 31% basins for the 1–4 years and 3–6 years TWS prediction respectively. The average NSE for the ESP predicted TWS is close to zero beyond 5 years, but the benchmark skill (NSE) is 0.19 and 0.11 for the TWS predictions at 5–8 years and 7–10 years lead. In addition, the elasticity framework based on the coordinate transformation (see Methods for details) can be applied to analyze the major sources of hydrological decadal predictability, as well as the actual forecast skill enhancement given improvements in IHCs and/or DCFs. Our benchmark skill provides a new norm to guide the application of decadal hydrological predictions.</p>
