<p id="Par14" class="p">A reliable hydrological prediction provides a valuable reference for optimal operation and management of water resources, therefore, hydrological skill elasticity can suggest whether investing on IHCs or DCFs can bring more benefit, and which way is the most cost-effective. The major source of hydrological predictability is different over different basins at different lead times. Therefore, whether improving IHCs or DCFs is more effective depends on specific situations. For example, the elasticity analysis shows that improving IHCs skill can bring more potential value than improving DCFs skill over northern parts of Eurasia, North America and Africa at 1–4 years lead (Fig.
