 </sup> to make the elasticity framework more straightforward for assessing actual skill. Through coordinate transformation, we can obtain the TWS prediction skill in the background of CMIP5 DCFs skill. It is viewed as a new benchmark, including information not only from IHCs but also from the state-of-the-art DCFs. In addition, we can obtain the benchmark skill for decadal TWS prediction through the elasticity framework instead of downscaling CMIP5 DCFs and driving a land surface hydrological model to produce TWS prediction that is similar to most seasonal hydrological forecasting studies
