<p id="Par14" class="p">The climate variables in this study—summer Tx and Pr—reflect our primary goal of demonstrating departure intensification at a global scale. We selected the Boreal and Austral summer (JJA and DJF, respectively) to approximate the warm season, and to be consistent with previous studies of temperature-precipitation coupling

 </sup> that are foundational to our study. However, we acknowledge that this season selection is problematic in the tropics and some subtropical regions, and have provided a parallel analysis using an alternative definition of summer—the hottest three consecutive months in each grid cell (Supplementary Note

We selected Tx as our temperature element in recognition that daily mean temperature could conflate different and potentially opposing physical processes driving daytime vs. nighttime temperature-precipitation correlations in many regions

 </sup>. We acknowledge that daily mean or minimum temperatures may be more salient elements for some regions and ecological processes. Identification of departure intensification in other economically and ecologically important coupled climate variables is a priority for future research. Our finding that departure intensification is limited to variability correlations stronger than −0.5 provides a guideline for interrogating the observational record for other coupled variables that are subject to departure intensification.
