 </sup>, our use of a pre-industrial baseline ignores local adaptation that has occurred during the industrial period, and may overstate the timing and magnitude of some of the disruptions associated with climate departures. The timescales of local adaptation are an important consideration in the assessment of the specific impacts of climate departures.
