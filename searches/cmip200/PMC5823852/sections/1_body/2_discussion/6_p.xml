<p id="Par18" class="p">Departures from natural climatic variability are a challenge to locally adapted natural and agricultural ecosystems. Decoupling of the climate change trend from the dominant historical mode of interannual variability can accelerate the rate at which locally unfamiliar climates develop, which may be a limitation on the ability of some organisms and societies to adapt to climate change

 </sup>. Our study has focused on this effect in terrestrial summer temperature and precipitation. However, the cause of departure intensification—a climate change trajectory that is misaligned with natural variability—likely applies to other climatic drivers of ecosystem function. The potential for climate departures to be amplified in coupled climate variables is an important consideration for climate change risk assessments and adaptation planning.
