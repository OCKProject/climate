<p id="Par13" class="p">We have demonstrated that a multivariate climate change trend can be stronger, relative to natural variability, than all of the individual trends of its component variables. This departure intensification effect occurs when the climate change trajectory is misaligned with the dominant mode of interannual variability in correlated climate variables. In the case of summer Tx and Pr—the focus of this study—these conditions hinge on stable or increasing precipitation. We found considerable intermodel variation in the amount and spatial pattern of departure intensification, due largely to intermodel variation in projected regional precipitation trends and the strength of simulated Tx-Pr correlations. Nevertheless, we also found that pronounced departure intensification is consistently limited to simulated climates with a summer Tx-Pr correlation stronger than −0.5. This result provides considerable direction for prioritizing regions for further risk assessments based on observed correlations.</p>
