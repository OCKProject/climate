 </sup>. However, investigations of compound events are sparse in many fields of climate change detection, impacts, and adaptation. Our study demonstrates a form of compound extremes arising from historically unusual combinations of conditions. These compound anomalies can occur both as single-year events and long-term climatic shifts. Identifying ecological and agricultural impacts associated with compound events and compound climate departures is an important area for further research.
