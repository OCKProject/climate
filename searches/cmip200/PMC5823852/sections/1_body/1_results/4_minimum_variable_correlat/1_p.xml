<p id="Par12" class="p">Bivariate climate departures are detected in tropical and subtropical regions of most climate models by the year 2020 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> and Supplementary Note 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref>). This suggests that departure intensification may be detectable in the observational record at low latitudes, consistent with other studies that have detected emergence of a local warming signal

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>
 </sup>. In extratropical regions where the climate signal has not yet emerged from natural variability, departure intensification likely is not yet detectable in the observational record. Nevertheless, all models indicate that regardless of the orthogonality of the bivariate climate change trajectory, substantial departure intensification only occurs where there is a strong negative correlation (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> &lt; −0.5) between summertime Tx and Pr (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). This general relationship provides a rule of thumb for evaluating the observational record for regions that are susceptible to intensified climate departures. CRU TS3.23 precipitation stations
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">44</xref>
 </sup> exhibit strong negative summertime Tx-Pr correlations in several distinct regions on all continents, particularly in China, central Asia, Australia, central USA, western Canada, Argentina, southern Africa, and the African Sahel (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). These regions are a priority for detection of departure intensification in the observational record, determining the probable trajectories of precipitation change, and identifying specific local impacts of departure intensification.
