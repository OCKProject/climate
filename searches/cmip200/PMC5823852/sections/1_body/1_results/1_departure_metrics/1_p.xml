<p id="Par8" class="p">We quantify the magnitude of climate departures as the proportion of years in the preceding 30-year period that are &gt;2
 <italic class="italic">σ</italic> (~1-in-20-year) anomalies of the internal natural variability of the model (i.e., historicalNat runs). We call this metric the 2
 <italic class="italic">σ</italic> proportion. By definition, assuming normality, the 2
 <italic class="italic">σ</italic> proportion has a null value of 0.046 in a stationary climate; i.e., the 2
 <italic class="italic">σ</italic> exceedance probability in the normal distribution. A non-stationary climate can be said to have fully departed from natural variability when the 2
 <italic class="italic">σ</italic> proportion is 1. We calculated the 2
 <italic class="italic">σ</italic> proportion for bivariate Tx-Pr anomalies using sigma dissimilarity

 </sup>. We use the term departure difference for the difference between the bivariate 2
 <italic class="italic">σ</italic> proportion and the larger of the 2
 <italic class="italic">σ</italic> proportions of Tx or Pr alone. Positive departure differences indicate that the bivariate S/N is stronger than either of the univariate S/N values individually. We use the maximum departure difference during the twenty-first century as our primary metric of departure intensification to allow comparisons between regions with various timings of departures.
