<p id="Par10" class="p">There is considerable intermodel variation in summer Tx-Pr correlations and the orthogonality of climate change (Supplementary Note 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>), and as a result there is large intermodel variation in the magnitude and spatial pattern of departure intensification (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). Nevertheless, departure intensification is evident in all models. On average, 23% of the land area of each model has a maximum departure difference &gt;0.2 (i.e., &gt;6 more years of 2
 <italic class="italic">σ</italic> anomalies in the preceding 30 years). The IPSL-CM5A_LR and CanESM2 models represent the intermodel range of departure intensification, with maximum departure differences &gt;0.2 on 9% and 34% of their land area, respectively. Low departure intensification in IPSL-CM5A_LR is due to its low correlation between summertime Tx and Pr relative to the other models (Supplementary Note 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>). The reduced intensification in the GISS-E2-R projection is likely due to its pronounced lower climate sensitivity (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>).
