<p id="Par11" class="p">The S/N of summer Tx-Pr climate change is highest in the tropics (Supplementary Note 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref>). However, departure intensification of Tx-Pr regimes is evident at most latitudes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). It is generally absent from the Boreal and Arctic regions due to low Tx-Pr correlations. There is a strong relationship between the magnitude of departure intensification and the relative timing of departure of the bivariate Tx-Pr climate signal. As suggested by Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b–g</xref>, the bivariate climate departure can occur several decades prior to the departure of Tx alone (Supplementary Note 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref>). On average, 16% (intermodel range of 7–23%) of the land area of each model departs from the joint variability of Tx and Pr at least 10 years prior to the departure of either Tx or Pr alone (Supplementary Note 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref>). These departure timings are based on a threshold 2
 <italic class="italic">σ</italic> proportion of 0.25, which represents a 10-fold increase in the frequency of warm 2
 <italic class="italic">σ</italic> anomalies. The role of departure intensification in the relative timing of bivariate and univariate climate departures is strongly influenced by how climate departure is (arbitrarily) defined. Consequently, the relative timing of departures is a less reliable indicator of departure intensification than the maximum departure difference.
