<p id="Par9" class="p">Departure intensification is dependent on two factors: the strength of correlation (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>) between climate variables; and the orthogonality (
 <italic class="italic">θ</italic>) of climate change (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). The strength of the projected climate change signal is stronger in temperature than in precipitation in almost all grid cells (Supplementary Note 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>). Nevertheless, the precipitation trend determines the alignment of climate change with interannual variability: large departure intensification occurs where the bivariate trajectory of climate change is orthogonal (perpendicular) to the dominant mode of interannual variability, as in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b, e</xref>. Departure intensification does not occur if the Tx-Pr correlation is low (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2c</xref>) or if the trajectory of climate change is aligned with the dominant mode of variability, i.e., toward warmer-drier conditions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2d</xref>), except where the Tx-Pr correlation is very high (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2f</xref>). Departure intensification can be underestimated by our metric where the climate change signal is very strong (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2g</xref>), as both the univariate and bivariate anomalies rapidly exceed a 2
 <italic class="italic">σ</italic> proportion of 1.
