 </sup> to measure deviations from the bivariate distribution of temperature and precipitation. First, absolute bivariate anomalies are calculated as Mahalanobis distances from the centroid (multivariate mean) of the reference variability. Then, the squared distances are converted to percentiles of the

 <italic class="italic">σ</italic>, 2
 <italic class="italic">σ</italic>, and 3
 <italic class="italic">σ</italic> for ~68th, 95th, and 99.7th percentiles, respectively). Sigma dissimilarity facilitates direct probabilistic comparison between univariate and bivariate anomalies (Fig.

 <italic class="italic">θ</italic>) is measured as the inverse tangent of the relative magnitude of the 2051–2100 normals (Δ) of the principal components (PC1 and PC2) of reference variability, providing degrees of angular displacement from the dominant axis of interannual variability:
