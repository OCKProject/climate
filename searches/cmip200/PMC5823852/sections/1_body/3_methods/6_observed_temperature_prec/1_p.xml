 </sup> precipitation station observations from the source station files. We excluded stations with &lt;30 years of summer precipitation totals in the 1901â€“2013 period. Since precipitation and temperature are often not assessed at the same station, we used the CRU TS4.0 gridded Tx time series at the location of each precipitation station.
