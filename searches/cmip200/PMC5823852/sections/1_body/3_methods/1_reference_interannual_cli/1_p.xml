<p id="Par19" class="p">We used historical natural forcings (historicalNat) model runs as reference variability for each CMIP5 model. HistoricalNat runs exclude anthropogenic forcings such as greenhouse gas emissions and land use change over the period 1850–2005, but include historical natural radiative forcings (e.g., solar cycles and volcanic eruptions)

 </sup>. Pre-industrial control (piControl) runs are an alternative source of reference variability, but may have slightly biased natural variability due to the absence of volcanic forcings. For each model, we pooled all of the historicalNat runs available (excluding perturbed physics runs), such that the reference variability encompasses several historicalNat realizations of the 1850–2005 period. For example, the CanESM2 model, with 5 historicalNat runs, has
