<p id="Par20" class="p">Climate variables (e.g., with units of °C or mm) can be expressed as standardized anomalies, with units of standard deviations (symbolized as 
 <italic class="italic">σ</italic>) of interannual variability over a multidecadal reference period. Standardized anomalies are traditionally calculated as 
 <italic class="italic">z</italic>-scores, by subtracting the reference period mean and dividing by the reference period standard deviation

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">51</xref>
 </sup>. However, climate variables are often not normally distributed (e.g., substantial skewness), with the result that 
 <italic class="italic">z</italic>-scores can overestimate the probability of an anomaly on one tail of the distribution, and conversely underestimate it on the other. To overcome this problem, we normalized univariate standardized anomalies of both temperature and precipitation using a form of non-parametric quantile mapping

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" class="xref">52</xref>
 </sup>, which additionally preserves the magnitude of the climate change relative to reference variability. We determined that our analyses are not substantially different under other methods of correcting for non-normality, including univariate parametric quantile mapping (as used in the standardized precipitation index

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" class="xref">53</xref>
 </sup>), bivariate kernel density estimation, and multivariate quantile mapping

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">6</xref>). The reason for this robustness is that as a binary metric, the 2
 <italic class="italic">σ</italic> proportion (see below) is unaffected by the effect of normalization on the magnitude of anomalies beyond the 2
 <italic class="italic">σ</italic> threshold.
