<p id="Par22" class="p">The anomalies of projected twenty-first century climate change commonly exceed 3
 <italic class="italic">σ</italic> (an ~1/(1 − 0.9973) = 1-in-370-year exceedance), and therefore exceed the limits of statistical inference from even very large samples of modeled reference variability. This precludes quantification of the mean anomaly as a measure of departure from natural variability. Instead, we quantify the magnitude of climate change as the proportion of years in the preceding 30-year period that are &gt;2
 <italic class="italic">σ</italic> (~1-in-20-year) anomalies relative to the distribution of reference variability. We call this metric the 2
 <italic class="italic">σ</italic> proportion. We define the term departure difference as the difference between the bivariate and univariate 2
 <italic class="italic">σ</italic> proportions. Univariate 2
 <italic class="italic">σ</italic> proportions are calculated as the maximum of the 2
 <italic class="italic">σ</italic> proportions of temperature and precipitation. As a noise-reduction measure, we calculated the departure difference for each year from the mean of the 2
 <italic class="italic">σ</italic> proportions of several historical + RCP4.5 runs. The null values of departure difference are slightly negative (Supplementary Note 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">7</xref>): where the correlation is nonsignificant and there is no trend in precipitation, the bivariate 2
 <italic class="italic">σ</italic> proportion is less than the univariate 2
 <italic class="italic">σ</italic> proportion by up to 0.1 depending on the magnitude of the temperature change. Positive departure differences indicate that the bivariate S/N is stronger than the univariate climate S/N. Pseudocode for calculation of maximum departure difference is provided in Supplementary Note
