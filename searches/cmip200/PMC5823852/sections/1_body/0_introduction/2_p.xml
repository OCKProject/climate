<p id="Par4" class="p">In this paper, we use the term natural variability to encompass the pre-industrial historical variability of real-world climates as well as the non-anthropogenically forced internal variability of climate models. Departures from natural variability are commonly measured using the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), which expresses changes in one climatic variable (the signal) relative to the scale of natural variability in that variable (the noise)

 </sup>. Typically, the noise is defined as standard deviations of interannual variability (symbolized with sigma, 
 <italic class="italic">σ</italic>), in which case S/N is equivalent to a standardized anomaly. S/N was originally used for the detection of climate change

 </sup>. However, following the general logic of local adaptation to natural variability, S/N has become a widespread metric in many fields of climate change impact assessment, such as the human perceptibility of climate change
