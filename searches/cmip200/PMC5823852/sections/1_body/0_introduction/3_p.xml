 </sup>. This correlation is driven primarily by evaporative cooling, but also by reflection of sunlight by clouds, and land-atmosphere coupling

 </sup>. As a result of this relationship, natural variability in many terrestrial locations lies along an axis from warm-and-dry to cool-and-wet conditions, and excludes conditions that are simultaneously much warmer and wetter than average. A climate change trend perpendicular to this axis, toward warmer-wetter conditions, can produce a larger and earlier departure from natural variability than in either Tx or Pr alone (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). This type of climate change trajectory is projected by climate models to occur in many regions

 </sup>. This example illustrates how extreme conditions can arise from unusual combinations of climate variables that are individually not in an extreme state. We use the term departure intensification to describe a multivariate climate change signal that is stronger relative to natural variability than the signals of its component variables. Our use of the term departure is synonymous with the use of emergence in the S/N and time-of-emergence literatures mentioned previously
