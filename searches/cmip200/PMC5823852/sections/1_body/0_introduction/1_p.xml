<p id="Par3" class="p">Understanding climate change risks involves anticipating pressures on the adaptive capacity of socio-ecological systems. Given the complexity of these systems, it is important to identify general drivers of climate impacts that bridge the idiosyncratic responses of individual species, ecosystems, and societies. One prominent approach to assessing coarse-filter ecological and economic risks is to quantify climatic changes relative to local climatic variability
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>
 </sup>. The premise of this approach is that biological and human populations are locally adapted
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>
 </sup> to the year-to-year variability of their environments, and have coping mechanisms for climatic changes within this range of variability
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>
 </sup>. The hypothesis that adaptive capacity scales with environmental variability has some theoretical

 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">7</xref>

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>
 </sup> support in the context of ecosystems, where environmental variability is a component of natural selection on the life history, demographics, population genetic variation, and phenotypic plasticity of organisms. Further, historical variability is the range of conditions in which cultural and scientific knowledge about ecosystems has developed
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>
 </sup>. Departures from historical variability not only increase the potential for ecological disruptions to food security and ecosystem services
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>
 </sup> but also represent locally unfamiliar conditions in which adaptive responses may not be apparent to human communities

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">12</xref>
 </sup>. The magnitude of a departure from local interannual variability therefore is an important indicator of climate change risks.
