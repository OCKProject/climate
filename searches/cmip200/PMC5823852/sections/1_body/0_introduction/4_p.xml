 </sup>, departure intensification in summer temperature and precipitation is a coarse-filter indicator of ecological risk. Nevertheless, some specific potential impacts can be identified. Hostâ€“parasite interactions can be much more disruptive to the host species than the physiological effects of environmental change alone

 </sup>, and their impacts on food security, forest health, and ecosystem services. For example, the global increase in the incidence and severity of

 </sup>. Mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue fever are also of concern, because both the vector and pathogen are responsive to heat accumulation and standing water availability

 </sup>. The departure intensification effect suggests that the response of these agents to simultaneously warmer and wetter conditions may be out of proportion to their local historical response to unsynchronized anomalies of similar magnitude in temperature or precipitation alone. These disruptions could offset the benefits of increased precipitation in reducing hotter droughts

 </sup> induced by regional warming. Assessment of departure intensification in precipitation, temperature, and other coupled variables can provide an early warning of rapid ecological change that would not be apparent in analysis of individual climate variables.
