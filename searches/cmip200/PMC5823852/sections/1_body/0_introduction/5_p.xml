<p id="Par7" class="p">The goal of this paper is to describe the phenomenon of climate departure intensification using the example of summer Tx and Pr. We use a multivariate S/N approach to examine intermodel variation in departure intensification in RCP4.5 projections from six Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5

 </sup>) global climate models for the 1850–2100 period. We demonstrate that departure intensification is contingent on the degree to which a bivariate climate change trajectory is misaligned with (orthogonal to) the dominant mode of interannual variability in coupled variables with correlations of |

Station observations of summer Tx and Pr exhibit this level of correlation in distinct regions on all continents, narrowing the spatial extent for investigations of departure intensification. Our results suggest that precipitation trends can be important to the strength of multivariate climate change signals relative to natural variability, even though the S/N of precipitation variables are typically much less than those of temperature.
