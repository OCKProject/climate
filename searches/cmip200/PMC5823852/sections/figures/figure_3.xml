  <p class="p">Intermodel variation in departure intensification in summertime temperature and precipitation. Departure intensification, measured as maximum departure difference, is calculated from the mean time series of univariate and bivariate 2
   <italic class="italic">σ</italic> proportions of historical + RCP4.5 runs for each CMIP5 model. The number of runs in each ensemble is indicated in parentheses next to the model name. Departure difference is the frequency of bivariate 2
   <italic class="italic">σ</italic> proportions minus the frequency of univariate (greater of temperature or precipitation) 2
   <italic class="italic">σ</italic> proportions, both with respect to the 1850–2005 historicalNat simulations in each model. Positive values indicate a greater frequency of departures in the bivariate temperature-precipitation regime than in temperature or precipitation alone. Summer months are JJA (Northern Hemisphere) and DJF (Southern Hemisphere)
