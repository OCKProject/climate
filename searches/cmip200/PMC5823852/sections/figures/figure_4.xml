  <p class="p">Relationship of departure intensification to temperature-precipitation correlations and the orthogonality of climate change in six CMIP5 models. Orthogonality increases departure intensification at any given correlation. However, substantial departure intensification is only present at temperature-precipitation correlations stronger than 
   <italic class="italic">r</italic> = −0.5. Departure intensification, measured as maximum departure difference, is calculated from the mean time series of univariate and bivariate 2
   <italic class="italic">σ</italic> proportions of historical + RCP4.5 runs for each CMIP5 model. The correlation between summer mean daily maximum temperature (Tx) and precipitation (Pr) in each CMIP5 model is calculated from the r1i1p1 historicalNat run, typically for the years 1850–2006. The orthogonality of climate change (
   <italic class="italic">θ</italic>) is the angular displacement of the RCP4.5 single-model ensemble mean projected normals for the 2051–2100 period from the dominant axis of bivariate interannual variability. The number of runs in each ensemble is indicated in parentheses next to the model name. Oceans and Antarctica are not plotted. A random sample of 
   <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 1500 grid cells is plotted for each model to equalize plotting density. Dashed lines indicate a value of zero in the 
   <italic class="italic">x</italic>- and 
   <italic class="italic">y</italic>-axis
