  <p class="p">Univariate and bivariate climate departures for summer precipitation and mean daily maximum temperature at selected locations; CanESM2 RCP4.5 ensemble projection. 
   <bold class="bold">a</bold> Terrestrial regions where bivariate departures from natural variability exceed univariate departures, measured as maximum departure difference during the 1880–2100 period. 
   <bold class="bold">b</bold> Time series of univariate and bivariate 2
   <italic class="italic">σ</italic> proportions near Memphis, USA. Univariate values are the larger of the precipitation (Pr) and mean daily maximum temperature (Tx) 2
   <italic class="italic">σ</italic> proportions. Bivariate proportions are assessed against the joint distribution of Tx and Pr. Shaded regions of the time series indicate the spread of the 5-run CanESM2 ensemble; solid lines are the ensemble mean. 
   <bold class="bold">b</bold> (Inset) Scatterplot of CanESM2 historicalNat projections of Tx and Pr, pooled and normalized across five runs of the 1850–2006 period. Correlation (Pearson’s 
   <italic class="italic">r</italic>) is measured using the normalized values of Tx and Pr. The orthogonality of climate change (
   <italic class="italic">θ</italic>) is the angular displacement of the bivariate climate change trajectory from the dominant axis of bivariate interannual variability. 
   <bold class="bold">c</bold>–

   <bold class="bold">f</bold> the Colombian Amazon; and 
   <bold class="bold">g</bold> Manilla, Philippines. The dashed line in plot 
   <bold class="bold">b</bold> indicates the expected 2
   <italic class="italic">σ</italic> proportion of 0.046 in a stationary climate with Gaussian (normal) variability
