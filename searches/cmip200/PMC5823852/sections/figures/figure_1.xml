  <p class="p">Projected departure from historical climatic variability in a correlated temperature-precipitation regime. Summer precipitation and mean daily maximum temperature at Newcastle, Australia are negatively correlated (
   <italic class="italic">r</italic> = −0.7) in historical observations (gray dots). As a result, a climate change trajectory into warmer-wetter conditions (black line) can depart from the joint historical variability of temperature and precipitation while remaining within the individual historical ranges of variability of both temperature and precipitation. Historical observations are obtained from the CRU TS3.23
