<p class="p">To decrease the computational cost of the simulation, the 1/4° model was initialized in 1975 using an initial condition derived from a 1° ‘twin’ spun‐up from 1860 to 1975 under the same forcing data set. Intercomparison of the two model runs in an overlap period (1975–2000) found that they agreed well across a broad range of physical (temperature and salinity) and biogeochemical (nutrients, phyto‐ and zooplankton and primary production) metrics (Yool

Nonetheless, during this interval, the models diverged in certain regions (e.g. equatorial upwelling zones, Southern Ocean) where the increased resolution of the 1/4° model permitted improved performance (e.g. mesoscale features, vertical physics).
