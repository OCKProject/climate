This is a size‐based, intermediate complexity model that divides the plankton community into ‘small’ and ‘large’ portions, and which resolves the elemental cycles of nitrogen, silicon, iron, carbon and oxygen. NEMO is forced at the surface here using output from a simulation of the HadGEM2‐ES Earth system model run by the UK Meteorological Office (UKMO) which includes representations of the terrestrial and oceanic carbon cycles, atmospheric chemistry and aerosols (Collins

 <xref rid="gcb13247-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>) was performed as part of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Assessment Report 5 (AR5). The model's physical ocean state was initialized from the same initial state as HadGEM2‐ES; biogeochemistry was initialized using World Ocean Atlas (nutrients and oxygen) and GLODAP (DIC and alkalinity) climatology products.
