To assess the realism of large‐scale surface current patterns, we compare model output with absolute geostrophic velocities derived from satellite altimetry. The specific altimeter products used were produced by Ssalto/

Large‐scale surface currents are in near geostrophic balance, and satellite altimetry provides an accurate estimate of their position. We note that in addition to the geostrophic velocities derived from the slope in sea surface height (SSH) in AVISO, surface velocities also contain an ageostrophic component (e.g. Ekman velocity). However, the discrepancies between the actual and the geostrophic surface velocities are small and do not affect the validity of using geostrophic velocities derived from altimetry to assess the pathways of surface ocean currents in our model.
