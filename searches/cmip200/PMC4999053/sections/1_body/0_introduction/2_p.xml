 <xref rid="gcb13247-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>; henceforth HP14) identified 24 fast‐warming marine areas – so‐called hotspots – and suggested that these could serve as ‘natural laboratories’ where the mechanistic links between ocean warming and biological responses could be studied in advance of wider scale impacts predicted for later in the 21st century. Furthermore, climate adaptation options in marine hotspots could be explored as human dependence on marine resources is very high in many of these areas. During the 21st century, changes in ocean physical and biogeochemical parameters are anticipated to greatly impact ocean ecosystems. Coastal‐marine food resources will alter as a result of species‐specific direct responses to drivers of climate change, such as distribution and abundance of species changing in response to temperature, as already reported from south‐east Australia (Frusher

 <xref rid="gcb13247-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). However, adaptation options within the context of climate change must build on a solid understanding of the physical, biological and human aspects of the given systems, and a recognition that marine systems and human societies are really parts of a unified marine socio‐ecological system (Perry
