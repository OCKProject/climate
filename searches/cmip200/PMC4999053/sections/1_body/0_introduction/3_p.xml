<p class="p">However, rising temperatures are not the only climatic factor impacting ocean ecosystems. ‘Warming up, turning sour, losing breath’ (Gruber, 
 <xref rid="gcb13247-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>) has become a widely used summary of the major climatic stressors of ocean ecosystems: warming, acidification and deoxygenation, all with implications for marine productivity (Doney

 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="gcb13247-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Changing ocean stratification and circulation may also provide wide‐ranging biological effects (Doney 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="gcb13247-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Changes in these climatic factors are driven by different mechanisms and different aspects of global ocean dynamics and biogeochemistry (Bopp 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="gcb13247-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>), and consequently, patterns of their fastest changes (or hotspots) do not necessarily coincide in space. Although warming of the ocean may not always be the strongest climatic factor affecting marine ecosystems (e.g. Marañón 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="gcb13247-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>), the rise of the SST probably remains the most unequivocal signature of the climate change. Thus, in this study, we begin with the framework of SST hotspots suggested by Hobday &amp; Pecl (
 <xref rid="gcb13247-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). We closely examine five marine SST‐defined hotspots that affect areas off the coasts of Eastern Australia, Brazil, South Africa, India and Madagascar and investigate whether other climatic stressors of marine ecosystem are likely to manifest themselves in these areas. These particular hotspots have marine resource‐dependent communities and provide examples of social, economic and ecological commonalities and contrasts that are a focus of a large international partnership working towards reducing coastal vulnerability (Hobday 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="gcb13247-bib-0502" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). This partnership, ‘Global understanding and learning for local solutions: Reducing vulnerability of marine‐dependent coastal communities’ (GULLS), works towards improving community adaptation efforts by characterizing, assessing and projecting the likely future of coastal‐marine food resources through the provision and sharing of knowledge between regional hotspots. In order to provide a unifying tool to assess climate change mechanisms common across these temperature‐driven hotspots and to quantify changes in stratification, ocean circulation, nutrient supply, primary productivity, acidification and deoxygenation, we use a global ocean biogeochemical model coupled to a climate model. Crucially, this model is at higher resolution than those used in IPCC AR5 which allows much greater regional realism.
