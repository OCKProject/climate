<p class="p">Footprints of climate change have been reported for nearly all major marine ecosystems around the world (e.g. Hoegh‐Guldberg &amp; Bruno,

 <xref rid="gcb13247-bib-0070" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). However, neither the physical drivers of climate change nor their impacts on ocean ecosystems manifest homogeneously over the world oceans. For instance, waters of subtropical western boundary currents are warming two to three times faster than the global mean for the world's oceans (Wu 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="gcb13247-bib-0106" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Elsewhere, polar amplification leads to Arctic Ocean warming faster than the global trend (e.g. Pithan &amp; Mauritsen, 
 <xref rid="gcb13247-bib-0075" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Such amplification, together with the associated retreat of Arctic sea ice, leads to ecosystem changes that are often in the opposite direction to global trends, with primary production increasing rather than following the global decline (e.g. Popova 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="gcb13247-bib-0080" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Meanwhile, the highly productive upwelling zones of eastern boundary currents have a strong sensitivity to climate change, driven by changing patterns of upwelling events that are becoming less frequent but stronger, and longer in duration (e.g. Iles
