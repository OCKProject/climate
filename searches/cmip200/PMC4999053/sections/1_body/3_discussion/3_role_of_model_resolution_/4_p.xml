<p class="p">In part because of high computing cost, future projections of the climatic stressors presented here are made on the basis of a single run of a single model, and thus, estimates of uncertainty are not yet possible. Although ensembles of Earth System models are available in the CMIP5 archive, their resolution is insufficient to address mechanisms behind the hotspot drivers associated with the ocean circulation and in the majority of cases with the western boundary currents. It is anticipated that CMIP6 will see increases in model resolution – reaching 1/4° in some models – and this will allow uncertainty estimates to be made. The alternative approach of estimating uncertainty on the basis of multiple runs of our model is limited because of the high cost of global runs at this resolution.</p>
