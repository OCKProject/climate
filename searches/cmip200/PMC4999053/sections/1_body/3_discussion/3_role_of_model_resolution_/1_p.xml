<p class="p">Earth system models include atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and terrestrial and marine biota components and have been developed to investigate whole‐Earth impacts of future climate change. Against a backdrop of constantly increasing computing power, these models have correspondingly increased in the spatial detail that they can resolve. The last two decades have seen progress from typically 2 to 3° horizontal resolution in IPCC AR4 (Hasumi,

 <xref rid="gcb13247-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>), and it is anticipated that 1/4° models currently under development will be used in the expected AR6. That said, it is important at the outset to acknowledge the extreme computational cost of such models, and a number of modelling strategies have been developed to manage or constrain these costs. One such approach is to run ocean‐only models under atmospheric forcing derived from extant climate change runs. This allows simulations of the ocean to achieve high spatial resolution at lower cost, albeit at a price of omitting feedbacks with the rest of the Earth system.
