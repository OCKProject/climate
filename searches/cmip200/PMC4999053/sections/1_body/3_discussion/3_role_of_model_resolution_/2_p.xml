<p class="p">In this study, we employ such an approach and drive our ocean model at a resolution of 1/4° with forcing derived from an existing IPCC RCP8.5 simulation (Yool

 <xref rid="gcb13247-bib-0109" ref-type="ref" class="xref">b</xref>). We show that this resolution allows us to achieve a certain regional realism at a spatial scale appropriate to marine hotspots, mostly because of a better representation of ocean circulation and, specifically, ocean western boundary currents. Such increased realism of ocean circulation is paramount for hotspot analysis, as the root of fast warming in these marine areas is change in the variability or location of local western boundary currents (Wu

 <xref rid="gcb13247-bib-0106" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Equally important is the improved representation of upwelling areas, although the resolution of the overlying atmosphere is of high relevance in the case of coastal upwelling (Hasumi, 
 <xref rid="gcb13247-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Upwelling zones are also crucial in the analysis of marine hotspots as they are often areas of decreased oxygenation and increased ocean acidification, two important stressors of marine ecosystems (Bopp
