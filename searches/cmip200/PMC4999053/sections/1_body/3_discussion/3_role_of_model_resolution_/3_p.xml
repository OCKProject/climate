<p class="p">Figure S9 illustrates the change in modelled representation of the Agulhas current and its retroflection as model resolution increases from 1° to 1/4° (employed in this study) to 1/12°, as compared to satellite‐derived AVISO data. Although the largest step‐change in improved realism of boundary current strength and location is undoubtedly made when the resolution changes from 1° to 1/4°, circulation variability on its periphery and, more generally, within the gyres only becomes realistic as the resolution increases to 1/12°, at which point eddies are not just permitted, but are resolved. Thus, although an era of CMIP6 models of 1/4° resolution promises to approach regional realism at sub‐basin scale, there remains a strong motivation for the more computationally efficient forced ocean models to be employed for analyses of climate change impacts on ecosystems. Undoubtedly, regional downscaling can achieve much greater resolution and, consequently, representation of regional details (e.g. Matear

 <xref rid="gcb13247-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). However, as Fig. S9 illustrates, downscaling can only be as successful as the lower resolution, basin‐ or global‐scale model from which it is downscaled. Additionally, for regional cross‐comparison studies such as this one, the use of a high‐resolution, global‐scale model remains a compellingly self‐consistent way forward, even if its resolution does not permit all mesoscale or submesoscale features. Substantial improvements in the representation of ocean circulation translate into better performance of marine biogeochemistry. Figure S10 shows annual mean primary production (year 2000) for 1° and ¼° models alongside a satellite‐derived estimate. The following main features are noteworthy: an increase in productivity at the centres of oligotrophic gyres by a factor of 2‐3; improvement in the spatial distribution of primary production in the Bay of Bengal and in the vicinity of Agulhas Retroflection; more pronounced local productivity maxima associated with the Brazil current. However, at the same time, we note a worsening of the agreement in the Mozambique Channel, where underestimated primary production at 1° resolution is even lower in the ¼° resolution version of the model. A detailed discussion of performance issues related to increased resolution is beyond the scope of this manuscript; however, they are discussed in part elsewhere (Yool
