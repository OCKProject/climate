<p class="p">One possible approach for summarizing the main results of this study is illustrated in the Appendix S1 and Fig. S11. While such a summary is inevitably rudimentary, it presents the impacts of the stressors on marine ecosystems in a format that aims to facilitate the necessary socio‐economic analysis (Hobday

Our analyses indicate that adaptation to climate change impacts on coastal fisheries and fishing communities will be required in all five hotspots. Simplified information from climate models, as presented here, will assist in both climate and socio‐economic research and facilitate the integrated approaches that are required to build resilience in the most vulnerable social–ecological systems.
