<p class="p">One of the main obstacles to accommodating climate change into future management strategies is the complexity of information provided by models and the difficulty in relating large‐scale climate trends to local impacts. There are no simple generic approaches to adaptation in fisheries and fishing communities: each case needs to be assessed through integrated planning to achieve clearly defined adaptation objectives (Porter

 <xref rid="gcb13247-bib-0081" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>), and research is required for understanding and predicting species‐specific responses to climate change in order to predict future stock responses (Pecl

Evaluating the vulnerability of societies to climate change impacts requires both (a) knowledge of the natural and climate‐induced variability of relevant environmental factors and (b) the likely consequences of such changes to local communities. As such, simplified relevant information from climate models is needed to facilitate links between both climate and socio‐economic research, and the science that informs resource management and strategy (Boyd
