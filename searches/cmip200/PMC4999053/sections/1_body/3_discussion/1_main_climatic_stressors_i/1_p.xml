<p class="p">The concept of marine warming hotspots suggested by HP14 on the basis of historical SST data builds on a considerable literature defining hotspots for biodiversity (e.g. Myers,

Analysing climate change impacts in such hotspots – regions that are experiencing high rates of change in this dominant climatic driver – may be useful in science–policy partnerships to facilitate an increase in the capacity of local communities to adapt to climate related change (e.g. Frusher

In this study, we have analysed key climate change‐driven ecosystem stressors in five temperature‐defined marine hotspots in the Southern Hemisphere. Our aim has been to translate the richly detailed output of a climate model into a form which can readily be used to help guide research directions and decision‐making processes in the relevant regions.
