<p class="p">Using the saturation state of the biomineral aragonite (Ω), we showed that ocean acidification driven by the ocean uptake of anthropogenic CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> is unlikely to become a major threat in the five focus hotspot areas in this century (assuming RCP8.5 scenario; Fig. S7). Largely due to naturally low Ω, the Arctic Ocean is the basin first projected to manifest surface undersaturation in respect to aragonite, and this has already occurred in some areas (e.g. Bates

The onset of undersaturation in the Arctic is followed by that in the Southern Ocean, with the widespread surface undersaturation in the most southerly areas propagating northward by around 2050, and by areas of the eastern boundary upwelling systems which typically manifest widespread surface undersaturation towards the end of the century (e.g. McNeil &amp; Matear,
