<p class="p">The example of the east Australian hotspot also illustrates that, while SST remains one of the most straightforward and easy‐to‐observe indicators of climate change, it may be providing us with a limited picture. It draws attention to the fact that some regions with naturally high SST variability – and, thus, less clear SST trends – are also experiencing well‐documented changes in ecosystem dynamics associated with ocean circulation change. An example of a similar region outside of the scope of this study, but also characterized by a strong natural variability of oceanographic cycles, is the Galapagos archipelago, situated at the confluence of five ocean currents. This area has already experienced major biodiversity losses as a result of the synergistic impacts of changes in circulation and major oceanographic characteristics likely altered by climate change, as well as overfishing (Edgar
