<p class="p">In this paper, we have presented projected changes of the main surface currents affecting five focus hotspots. In particular, we noted a weakening and shift of the Brazil current; a south‐east shift and intensification of the Agulhas retroflection; a weakening of the Mozambique current; intensification of the seasonally reversible circulation in the Bay of Bengal; and a southward shift and intensification of the East Australia Current. In the context of global changes of the circulation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="gcb13247-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>a), South African and Australian hotspots are amongst the areas experiencing the strongest shift/intensification of the dominant surface currents, similar to the Gulfstream, Kuroshio and south most part of the Brazil Current (outside of the Brazil hotspot considered here). The indirect impact of advection was accounted for in this study through projected changes in the main stressors, such as SST or productivity. However, estimating the direct impact of changing circulation is a much more difficult task that that can best be studied using Lagrangian approaches (e.g. Popova

 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="gcb13247-bib-0503" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). We diagnosed potential changes in the strength and location of the main currents. However, this work is only a first step in understanding projected changes in ocean circulation, and future work that examines the roles of changing transport and connectivity in‐depth will be necessary to properly characterize the significance of this driver for change in ocean ecosystems.
