<p class="p">Decadal‐averaged (2000–2009) modelled surface ocean circulation and satellite‐derived velocities are shown in Fig. S1. Decadal‐averaged values have been chosen to focus on persistent circulation features that are not obscured by short‐term variability such as mesoscale eddies. The comparison shows good agreement between observed and modelled surface circulation features, with a correlation coefficient (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>) of 0.69 for the global domain. For each of the hotspots, a range of patterns are observed as described below.
