 <xref rid="gcb13247-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> shows the relative deviation of the decadal‐average current speed of 2050–2059 (‘2050s’) from that of the period 2000–2010 (‘2000s’). The results show the following general features: a weakening of the Brazil current and its shift eastward in the northern part of the area and westward in the southern part of the area (Fig. 
 <xref rid="gcb13247-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>b); a south‐east shift and intensification of the Agulhas retroflection (Fig. 
 <xref rid="gcb13247-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>c); a weakening of the Mozambique current (Fig. 
 <xref rid="gcb13247-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>d); intensification of the circulation in the Bay of Bengal (Fig. 
 <xref rid="gcb13247-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>e); and a southward shift and intensification of the East Australia Current. In the context of global changes in circulation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="gcb13247-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>a), the South African and Australian hotspots are amongst the areas experiencing the strongest shift and/or intensification of the dominant surface currents globally, similar to the Gulf Stream, Kuroshio and south most part of the Brazil current/Subtropical Convergence (outside the Brazil hotspot region considered here). Although our results point towards future changes in circulation, further in‐depth Lagrangian study is required to estimate the impact such changes may impose on ocean ecosystems in terms of changes in the nutrient pathways, connectivity and migration/extinction of species with planktonic phases.
