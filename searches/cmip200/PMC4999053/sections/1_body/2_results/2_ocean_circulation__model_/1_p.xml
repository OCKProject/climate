 <xref rid="gcb13247-bib-0106" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>), some of the fastest warming observed is associated with the shift of and/or intensification of boundary currents. The key importance of circulation for potential changes in ecosystem functioning across various regions of the ocean has been highlighted by several authors, for instance Sorte (

Particularly, important factors are the pivotal role of circulation in setting species range limits, and in limiting or facilitating species redistribution in a changing climate. Consequently, changes to ocean circulation are one of the key climate change‐induced stressors of ocean ecosystems, and it is therefore critical to assess how well models can reproduce key circulation features if their projected changes are to be judged reliable.
