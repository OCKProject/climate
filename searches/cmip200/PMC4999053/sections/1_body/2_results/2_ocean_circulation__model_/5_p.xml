<p class="p">In the Mozambique Channel hotspot (Fig. S1g, h), surface circulation is dominated by the South equatorial current that feeds the East Madagascar current and Mozambique current (Tomczak &amp; Godfrey,

Although the model reproduces the strength and location of the currents, they are also narrower than observed, again due to an insufficient transfer of horizontal energy by mesoscale eddies. This is especially pronounced in the Mozambique Channel which is characterized by frequent occurrence of anticyclonic eddies along the western flank of the channel (e.g. Quartly &amp; Srokosz,
