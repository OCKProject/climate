<p class="p">The Agulhas current, one of the strongest currents in the world oceans, is the main feature of the South African hotspot. This is a western boundary current of the southern Indian Ocean subtropical gyre that flows south‐west along the east coast of Africa. Towards the southern tip of Africa, it separates from the coast, looping anticlockwise as the Agulhas retroflection and feeding back into the Indian Ocean (e.g. Beal

The model reproduces the location and strength of the Agulhas retroflection well (with a r of 0.68), although it is narrower in the model with underestimated variability at its periphery due to model resolution not being fully eddy‐resolving (see

On the western coast of Africa, the model clearly shows the Benguela Current, a northward flowing ocean current that forms the eastern portion of the South Atlantic Ocean gyre (Fig. S1e, f), although this current is probably too narrow to be clearly defined in the AVISO data product.
