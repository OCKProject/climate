<p class="p">We analyse the other three indicators (stratification, nitrate and primary production) in a similar manner with the time evolution for 1990–2099 presented in Figs 
 <xref rid="gcb13247-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref> and 
 <xref rid="gcb13247-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>, Fig. S5. Unlike SST, these stressors manifest strong interannual variability but do not show substantial deviation from their baseline variability at any time over the century. The only hotspot where stratification (maximum UML depth) shows substantial shallowing is the Indian hotspot (Fig. 
 <xref rid="gcb13247-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>d), where shallow values consistently occur after 2050. Interestingly, and in contrast with other regions, stabilization of stratification in this area is accompanied by an increase in nitrate. This probably points towards changes in horizontal advection, rather than stratification, as being the main driver of nutrient content in this area.
