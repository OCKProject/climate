<p class="p">Next, we analyse projected future changes of these model characteristics averaged over hotspot areas. Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb13247-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> shows model annual and decadal mean SST for the period 1990–2099, averaged for the hotspot areas. Strong increases in SST are evident for all areas even against a background of interannual variability. From 2000 to 2099, SSTs typically change by around 3–4 °C across all of the hotspots examined, with the South African hotspot showing the smallest increase of around 3 °C (Fig. 
 <xref rid="gcb13247-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>b) and the east Australian and Indian hotspots showing the greatest increases, in excess of 4 °C. The hotspot of eastern Australia has the strongest baseline variability (17.4 ± 0.6 °C, Fig. 
 <xref rid="gcb13247-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>a), while the Indian Hotspot (Figs 
 <xref rid="gcb13247-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>d) is characterized by the lowest baseline variability (28.3 ± 0.3 °C). Consequently, in the current decade (2010–2019, Fig. 
 <xref rid="gcb13247-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>a), eastern Australia is experiencing a rate of change similar to its baseline variability, with SST showing values outside of this range in the decade 2020–2029, while the Indian hotspot already manifests SST values outside of the range of natural variability in the current decade. Over decade 2020–2029 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="gcb13247-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>b), all five hotspots experience a substantial change in SST over at least part of their area.
