<p class="p">We examine the number of years in decades 2010–2019 and 2020–2029 when primary production is outside of the range of its baseline variability (Fig. S6). Unlike SST (cf. Fig. 
 <xref rid="gcb13247-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> and Fig. S6), primary production does not a show substantial deviation from its baseline variability in any of our five focus hotspots nor, in fact, in almost any of the other hotspots reported in HP14, with the exception of the Indo‐Chinese hotspot. Over the global ocean, areas with the strongest signal in primary production are situated in the Gulf Stream, the western equatorial Pacific, the equator‐ward flanks of the South Pacific subtropical gyre and the marginal ice zones of the Southern Ocean. Over the global scale, decoupling of the fastest warming areas from the areas of strongest changes in primary production is not surprising. While increases in SST generally work towards stabilization of stratification, and thus a reduction in nutrient supply, it will only have a pronounced effect on primary production in the areas that are already limited by nutrients and where concentrations are dominated by vertical supply mechanisms. Similarly, the details of carbonate chemistry and the geographical pattern of oceanic CO
