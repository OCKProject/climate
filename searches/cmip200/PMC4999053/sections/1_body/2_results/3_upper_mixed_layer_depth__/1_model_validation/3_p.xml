In this case, the satellite‐derived values should be taken as guidance only as these are estimates derived from the simple average of three algorithms developed to relate ocean colour to phytoplankton productivity and the uncertainty of these estimates is substantial especially in the shelf regions (as per Yool 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="gcb13247-bib-0108" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013a</xref>). The five focus hotspots span a wide range of productivity regimes from highly oligotrophic (&lt;&lt;0.5 g C m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> day
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>; substantial areas of the Brazilian and Mozambique Channel hotspots) through moderately productive (0.5–0.8 g C m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> day
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>; the Indian and east Australia hotspots) to some of the most productive ecosystems of the world (&gt;0.8 g C m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> day
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>; part of the South Africa hotspot). In general, the model reproduces this range well, although as a result of underestimated DIN concentrations in the subtropical gyres, primary production there is also underestimated. This underestimation most clearly manifests itself in the Brazilian and Mozambique Channel hotspots (Fig. S3c, d, g, h) where primary production is about half that of the satellite‐derived estimates.
