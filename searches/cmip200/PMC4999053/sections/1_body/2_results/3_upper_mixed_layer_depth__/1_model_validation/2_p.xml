<p class="p">Modelled and climatological annual mean concentrations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), averaged over the top 100 m of the water column, are shown in Fig. S3. The model has a tendency to underestimate DIN concentration in oligotrophic areas, and in particular for the Brazilian, Indian and Mozambique Channel hotspots. These three hotspots are more oligotrophic in the model than observed climatology suggests, with modelled annual mean values underestimated by a factor of two. In the cases of the Brazilian and Mozambique Channel hotspots, this underestimation can be attributed, at least partially, to the underestimated depth of winter mixing (cf. Fig. S2). Underestimated nutrient concentration in the subtropical gyres is a well‐known problem of global and basin‐scale models (e.g. Levy

Although the model utilized in this study is substantially improved in resolution relative to the CMIP5 models, this resolution is still inadequate to fully describe mesoscale and submesoscale processes that act as components of vertical nutrient supply (e.g. Levy

 <xref rid="gcb13247-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). By contrast, the South Africa and east Australian hotspots are located outside of oligotrophic areas and DIN concentrations are reproduced well compared to the climatology (Fig. S3).
