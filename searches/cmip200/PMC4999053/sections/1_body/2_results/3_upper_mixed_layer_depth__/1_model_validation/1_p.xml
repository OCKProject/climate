<p class="p">We chose the maximum annual depth of the upper mixed layer (UML; based on monthly mean values) as a convenient measure of the state of water column stratification and exchange with deeper layers (e.g. Popova

 <xref rid="gcb13247-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>), are shown in Fig. S2. The five hotspots of focus here span areas from the equatorial (e.g. Indian hotspot), with typically low‐annual variability and maximum UML &lt;50 m, to high latitudes (e.g. the southern part of the east Australian hotspot), where winter mixing is substantial and penetrates below 300 m. The model broadly reproduces these contrasting regimes. The largest discrepancies between the model and the observed WOA climatology occur at the east Australian hotspot where the model underestimates the depth of winter mixing at its southern edge (Fig. S2k, l). Similarly, the model underestimates winter mixing in the southern part of the South African hotspot (Fig. S2e, f). In spite of the model capturing general patterns of UML variability, some regional discrepancies remain, and their attribution to a particular feature (or features) of the model is not straightforward. Nonetheless, UML dynamics are critical for those of the modelled ecosystem, and their representation should thus remain a focus for improvement as climate models develop.
