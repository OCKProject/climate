<p class="p">Again, due to limited resolution and missing shelf processes, the model has a tendency to underestimate productivity in shelf regions. The Indian hotspot, with its shelf‐enhanced primary production, presents an example of this. In contrast, the Brazilian hotspot presents an interesting example where the model does reproduce shelf‐enhanced productivity possibly because of the large‐scale upwelling associated with the Brazil Current (e.g. Campos

The model shows higher than observed primary production in the most southerly areas of the east Australian and South African hotspots as it tends to locate a transition zone to the low productive Southern Ocean further south than is indicated by the observations. Overestimated primary production is driven by the higher than observed DIN in these hotspots, which in turn is probably a result of overestimated vertical diffusivities in the Southern Ocean (Yool
