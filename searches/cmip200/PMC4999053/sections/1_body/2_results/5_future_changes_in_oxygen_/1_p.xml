<p class="p">Reduced concentrations of dissolved oxygen (O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) occur for a number of reasons. In coastal zones, they may result from eutrophication, which causes increased surface productivity and then increased oxygen consumption in interior waters (e.g. Gilbert 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="gcb13247-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). Another cause is ocean warming, which decreases the solubility of oxygen in surface waters and effectively decreases the ocean inventory of dissolved O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. Coupled to this is reduced interior ventilation because of circulation or stratification changes, which tend to decrease supply of dissolved O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> to the ocean's interior. Warmer surface temperatures also tend to increase remineralization rates of sinking organic material, with the result that the majority of oxygen consumption can be focused into a narrower, shallower band. Below a certain hypoxic threshold (50–80 mmol m

 <xref rid="gcb13247-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>) serious damage to ecosystems can be expected. Modelled vertical extent of oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) for decade 2000–2009 and its future changes by decade 2050–2060 are shown in Fig. S8. Figure S8b shows how changes to the OMZ manifest as characteristic ‘stripes’ of alternating expansion and contraction. These stripes are a result of shifts in the positions of the main currents that define the boundaries of the OMZs (Brandt 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="gcb13247-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). As can also be seen in Fig. S8, OMZs are most pronounced in eastern boundary upwelling areas, systems that none of our focus hotspots belong to. The only focus area with an OMZ is the Indian hotspot where the modelled region of hypoxia expands into the Bay of Bengal. By the decade 2050–2060, the OMZ in this region expands into the Arabian Sea, but at the same time, it weakens in the northern part of the Bay of Bengal.
