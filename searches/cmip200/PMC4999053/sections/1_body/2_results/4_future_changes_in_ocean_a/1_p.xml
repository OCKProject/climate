<p class="p">Ocean acidification – the consequence of oceanic uptake of anthropogenic carbon dioxide from the atmosphere – is now widely recognized as a major stressor on ocean ecosystems (e.g. Gruber

 <xref rid="gcb13247-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Ocean acidification is expected to impact key physiological and ecological processes of organisms, with consequences for ecosystems in which they occur and benefits obtained from them by society (Gattuso 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="gcb13247-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Environmental conditions in which aragonite (the more soluble of two biogenic forms of calcium carbonate) becomes undersaturated are projected to first occur in polar regions (e.g. Popova

 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="gcb13247-bib-0109" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013b</xref>). To illustrate this, the first occurrence of monthly mean undersaturated surface waters in respect to aragonite is shown in Fig. S7, and this is shown both in terms of years of the 21st century and in values of atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. For ocean acidification to impact ecosystems in our focus hotspots, atmospheric pCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> should substantially exceed 1000 ppm (Popova
