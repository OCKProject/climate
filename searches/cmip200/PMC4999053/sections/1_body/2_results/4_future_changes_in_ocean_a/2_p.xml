<p class="p">Although Fig. S7 is focused on surface conditions, undersaturation on the seabed of shelf waters is also important, as many important and vulnerable species live in benthic habitats. The first occurrence of undersaturation in the shelf bottom waters generally follows the same large‐scale patterns of temporal progression as on the ocean surface. However, it may occur earlier in the areas affected by upwelling (e.g. Gruber

In our focus hotspots, the model shows onset of shelf bottom water undersaturation towards the end of the century in the Indian hotspot (northern part of the Bay of Bengal), the east Australian hotspot (Bass Strait) and the South African hotspot (western coast of Africa).
