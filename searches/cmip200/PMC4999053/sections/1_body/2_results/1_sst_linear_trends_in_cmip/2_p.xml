<p class="p">Will these hotspot areas persist into the future? The frequency of hotspot occurrence in CMIP5 models for the period 2001–2050 (RCP8.5 scenario) is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="gcb13247-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>b. The models are consistent in projecting the Gulf Stream and Kuroshio extensions and the subarctic Pacific as remaining as fast‐warming areas, and they are joined by the prominent additions of the Barents Sea and the California current. At least one‐third of the models show the Brazil and East Australian currents as future hotspots, while the Indian, Mozambique Channel and South African hotspots persist into the future in only 1–2 models. Similar trends were noted by HP14 in the lower resolution CMIP3 models.
