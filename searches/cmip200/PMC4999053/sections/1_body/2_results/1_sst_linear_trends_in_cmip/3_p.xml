<p class="p">The future linear SST trends found in NEMO are in general agreement with those from the CMIP5 runs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="gcb13247-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>c). Of the five focal hotspots, East Australia shows the fastest warming trend of up to 8 °C for the 2001–2050 time period examined, followed by the South African hotspot (in particular the area of Agulhas retroflection) with warming of up to 4 °C across the 50‐yr period. The warming trends across the rest of the hotspots are approximately 3 °C over the 50‐yr period (cf. 1.3 °C across the 50 years period global mean).
