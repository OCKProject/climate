<p class="p">On the basis of historical sea surface temperature (SST) trends for the period 1950–1999, HP14 identified 24 marine hotspots representing the upper 10% of areas affected by ocean warming. Using the same approach, they showed that 19 of the 24 historical hotspots were identified in at least one of the six climate models from the CMIP3 archive (IPCC TAR). Following HP14, we repeated the analysis for the 23 models from the CMIP5 archive (Table

The frequency of hotspot occurrence in the CMIP5 models (number of models showing existence of a hotspot in a grid point) is shown in Fig.

 <xref rid="gcb13247-bib-0106" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>), we note a higher consistency for models to reproduce hotspots in the areas of the western boundary current extensions (Brazil, Kuroshio, Gulf Stream, Agulhas and East Australian currents). Models are also consistent in reproducing enhanced warming in the area of the Californian upwelling, and the subarctic Pacific and East Greenland currents. However, hotspots in tropical and equatorial areas (including the Mozambique Channel and Indian hotpots analysed in this study), as well as those in the high Arctic, are not generally reproduced by the models. These are the areas where higher resolution is particularly important to reproduce the key features of ocean dynamics. Thus, we find that CMIP5 models reproduce the locations of warming hotspots more consistently than those from CMIP3, and it is to be expected that increases in resolution in CMIP6 models will with further improve hotspot representation in models.
