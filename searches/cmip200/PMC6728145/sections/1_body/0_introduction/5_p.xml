<p class="p">Here we tested the hypothesis that the Quaternary climate change effect on species range dynamics is correlated to the current extinction risk and population decline in extant mammals. We built models at global and biogeographical scales and for different taxonomic groups. By showing significant relationships between Quaternary range contraction and IUCNâ€™s extinction risk status, our findings support our prediction and indicate that deep past climate changes keep challenging species, making them more vulnerable to current human impacts.</p>
