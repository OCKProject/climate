<p class="p">The influence of climate change on extinction and extinction risk has been assessed mainly through two approaches: the effect of past climate change on past extinctions, e.g. Quaternary megafauna extinctions [

 <xref rid="pone.0221439.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>], or the effect of future climate change on extant species [

 <xref rid="pone.0221439.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Expressive climate changes occurred over the Quaternary glaciations, which combined with human impacts resulted in the extinction of many large mammal species in all continents across the last 50,000 years [
 <xref rid="pone.0221439.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. Extant mammals withstood Quaternary climate change as well and many species are still dealing with the negative impacts it may have caused them.
