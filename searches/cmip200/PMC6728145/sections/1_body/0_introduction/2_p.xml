However, we have limited knowledge on the magnitude to which species have undergone historical range contractions or expansions, meaning species currently in small ranges may have had larger, smaller or identical range sizes in the past. Most studies on extinction risk and range contractions focus mainly on the historical post-Columbus period, the last 500 years only [
