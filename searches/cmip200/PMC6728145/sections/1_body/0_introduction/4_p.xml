<p class="p">Considering past extinction events, we propose that Quaternary climate change, specifically across the last ice age, altered climatic conditions and this change represented shifts in species abundance in time and space. For some species it reduced the favorable climatic conditions with negative effects on their geographic ranges and population demography [
 <xref rid="pone.0221439.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Consequently, if speciesâ€™ ranges contracted during this period it would make them more vulnerable to subsequent human impacts. Thus, we expect historic range dynamics to explain the extinction risk and population decline of extant terrestrial mammals currently listed as threatened with extinction by IUCN.
