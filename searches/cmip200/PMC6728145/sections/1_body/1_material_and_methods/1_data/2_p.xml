All climate layers were obtained for four Ocean Atmospheric General Circulation Models (OAGCM): CCSM4, CNMR, GISS-E2-R and MIROC-ESM. To avoid collinearity amongst climate predictors when building ENMs, we applied a varimax-rotated factor analysis and selected the variable with the highest loading in each one of the first five rotated factors [
