<p class="p">Occurrence data for all extant mammals where gathered from the IUCN red list database (

The IUCN red list aims at monitoring the conservation status of species and is the most comprehensive inventory of the global conservation status of biological species. We searched for native terrestrial mammals according to their biogeographic realm and obtained their extent of occurrence. We converted the extent of occurrence (given as polygons) into occurrence points at a resolution of 0.5° of latitude/longitude. Point data was later used to model mammals’ range in both the Pre-industrial (present-day) and the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; 21,000 year ago) periods. From a total of 4645 species, 793 are listed in one of the IUCN’s threat categories: Critically Endangered (CR), Endangered (EN) and Vulnerable (VU), 3390 are listed as Near Threatened (NT) and Least Concerned (LC), and 462 species are listed as Data Deficient (DD) (Table A in
