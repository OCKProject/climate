<p class="p">To access Quaternary range dynamics, we modeled the ecological niche and potential distribution of all extant terrestrial mammals for the present-day and LGM period following the ensemble approach [
 <xref rid="pone.0221439.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. For this, we used 13 methods: BIOCLIM, Ecological Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA), Euclidian Distance (ED), Gower Distance (GD), Mahalanobis Distance (MD), Genetic Algorithm for Rule Set Production (GARP), Generalized Linear Models (GLM), Maximum Entropy (Maxent), Generalized Additive Models (GAM), Flexible Discriminant Analysis (FDA), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), Neural Networks (ANN) and Random Forest (RNDFOR). Because some methods require absence data, we selected, randomly, pseudo-absences and background across all realms' grids keeping prevalence at 50%. For methods that do not need pseudo-absence, we used the pseudo-absence as background [
