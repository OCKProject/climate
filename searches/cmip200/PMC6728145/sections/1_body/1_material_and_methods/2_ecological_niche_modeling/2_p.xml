<p class="p">Speciesâ€™ ENMs were built in each separated biogeographic realm to make results comparable among species and to constraint the selection of pseudo-absences/background into the species realm. We randomly selected 75% of the presence and pseudo-absence data to calibrate the models and the remaining 25% to evaluate them. This procedure was repeated 50 times [
 <xref rid="pone.0221439.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>] and models performance was evaluated with True Skill Statistics (TSS; [
 <xref rid="pone.0221439.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]). Models with poor performance (TSS &lt; 0.5) were initially eliminated and ensemble computed by weighted averaging the suitabilities from remaining good models using TSS values as weights. All ENM procedure was performed in the computational platform BIOENSEMBLES [
