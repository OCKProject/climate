<p class="p">Species’ geographic range size and reduction are considered in IUCN’s assessments of extinction risk, following criterion B [
 <xref rid="pone.0221439.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. Thus, it is expected that current range size is correlated to IUCN's threat status. Any eventual correlation found between the variation in geographic range (ΔRange) and threat status could be reflecting this relationship. We calculated Pearson’s correlation between the present-day range and our untransformed ΔRange (r = 0.06) and log-transformed ΔRange (r = 0.04). Given these low correlation coefficients, we feel confident our results are not a mere artifact of the potential relationships mentioned above. Furthermore, we analyze deep historical time through ENM, thus contractions or expansions found are influenced solely by differences in climatic variables between the present-day and the LGM. This is not a procedure used by IUCN, since their historical contractions are usually of the last 500 years and accounts mainly for anthropic actions.
