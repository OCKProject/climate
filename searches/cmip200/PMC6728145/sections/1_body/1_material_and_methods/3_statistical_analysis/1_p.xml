<p class="p">We used IUCN’s categories of threat as a proxy to extinction risk in extant mammals [

 <xref rid="pone.0221439.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>], treating it as a binomial response where CR, EN and VU are “threatened” and NT and LC are “not threatened” [
 <xref rid="pone.0221439.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. For these analyses DD species were removed, leaving 4183 species. We built General Linear Mixed-Effects Models (GLMMs) to test the extent with which the variation in geographic range (ΔRange) and abundance (ΔSuitability) between the present-day and LGM predict current mammals extinction risk. GLMM properly deals with nonnormal data (such as our binary threat status) by using binary family responses and incorporating random effects [
