<p class="p">Because body size is often correlated with mammals extinction risk, we included body mass as a variable to account for random effects in all our GLMMs to avoid biased results [
 <xref rid="pone.0221439.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0221439.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. Body mass data was obtained from the dataset available in [
 <xref rid="pone.0221439.ref041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>], which is largely based on the PanTHERIA dataset [
 <xref rid="pone.0221439.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. ΔRange, ΔSuitability and body mass were log-transformed. Later we converted body mass into a categorical variable by rounding the log-transformed values. This process generated 15 distinct categories, ranging from the smallest (weighting between 1.77 and 4.44g) to the largest mammals (2285.94 to 3824.54kg).
