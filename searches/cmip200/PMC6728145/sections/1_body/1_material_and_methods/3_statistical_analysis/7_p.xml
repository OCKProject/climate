<p class="p">Because diversity is not randomly distributed at broad geographic scales [
 <xref rid="pone.0221439.ref044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>] we also followed a deconstruction of biodiversity patterns approach [
 <xref rid="pone.0221439.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. This method decomposes richness into distinguished groups of species to better assess large-scale patterns [
 <xref rid="pone.0221439.ref046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>], and we applied it here to better assess extinction risk in different mammal groups and scales. Our criteria were: (1) groups (hereafter 'taxa') with phylogenetic relationships among species at levels lower than class and higher than genus and (2) taxa occurring in the same biogeographic realm. Biogeographic realms were defined as Afrotropic, Australasia, Indomalaya, Nearctic, Neotropic and Palearctic [
 <xref rid="pone.0221439.ref047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. Our approach resulted in nine monophyletic taxa, one paraphyletic taxon (Ungulata) and one group of minor clades composed of orders with less than 20 species (Table C in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0221439.s001" class="xref">S1 File</xref>; [
 <xref rid="pone.0221439.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]). The order Perissodactyla only has 15 species, thus we decided to create the paraphyletic group Ungulata (Perissodactyla + Artiodactyla) instead of adding Perissodactyla to the Minor Clades. This allows for comparisons with previous works that used Ungulata as a group (see [
 <xref rid="pone.0221439.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0221439.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0221439.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]). In realms where an order does not occur, taxa are characterized only by extant orders present (e.g. Pholidota does not occur in the Neotropic, only Carnivora). Furthermore, taxa with less than 20 species occurring in a realm were excluded from analyses.
