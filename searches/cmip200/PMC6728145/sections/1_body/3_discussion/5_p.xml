<p class="p">Predictive power of range contraction and abundance decline were particularly high for threatened species in notoriously small-bodied orders like Rodentia, Eulipotyphla and Lagomorpha. In Afrotheria, a taxon where range contraction had a predictive power of 71%, 11 out the 14 threatened species belong to the order Afrosoricida, likewise composed of small mammals such as golden-moles and tenrecs [
