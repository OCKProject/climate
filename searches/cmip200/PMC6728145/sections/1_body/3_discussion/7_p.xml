<p class="p">Most mammals are commonly threatened by habitat loss, modification and fragmentation [

 <xref rid="pone.0221439.ref072" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>]. Such threat coupled with negative response to past climate change imply a worrisome future for mammals in rapidly changing human-induced climates, especially because extinction is a synergetic process influenced by the interaction of multiple threats [
 <xref rid="pone.0221439.ref073" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>]. Inclusion of historical records has increased the precision of models predicting future threats [
 <xref rid="pone.0221439.ref074" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0221439.ref075" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>], improves our understanding of extant mammalian trait turnover [
 <xref rid="pone.0221439.ref070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>] and may help analyze species vulnerability to future anthropogenic impacts. Thus, fossil record, past climate change and historical range dynamics become important variables to be incorporated into future extinction risk analyses and conservation planning.
