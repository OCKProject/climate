<p class="p">Additionally, our findings show that species loss is not randomly distributed across the globe, as most mammals losing geographical range since the LGM occur mainly in the Southern hemisphere. Past Quaternary climate oscillations were most evident as changes in temperature at higher latitudes, allowing for range expansions as the landscape became ice-free and was rapidly recolonized [
 <xref rid="pone.0221439.ref057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>]. These temperature-dependent dynamics are probably more important at high latitudes and may be responsible for the regional extinctions of small-ranged species during glaciations [
 <xref rid="pone.0221439.ref058" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>]. On the other hand, Quaternary climate oscillations in the tropics had larger shifts in precipitation than in temperature, this possibly resulted in more range contractions than expansions, since no ice-free landscape became available [
 <xref rid="pone.0221439.ref057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>]. This greater climatic stability of tropical latitudes may have allowed for greater persistence of species and few extinctions during glaciations, even if in smaller ranges and saturated niches [
