<p class="p">Our findings demonstrate range contractions and abundance declines for mammals at wide spatial and temporal scales. Most importantly, our findings establish historical range and habitat suitability variation through time as relevant predictors to extinction risk for studies in the future. At global and biogeographical scales, all groups that underwent significant Quaternary range contractions have currently more species listed in IUCNâ€™s threat categories than groups whose ranges did not contract significantly. We believe this reinforces the strength of using range contractions as a key predictor of extinction risk into climate change scenarios. Complementarily, studies at local scales have also registered abundance decline and/or range contractions in small mammals (but specially in rodents) between the LGM and present-day in the Pacific coast of the United States [
