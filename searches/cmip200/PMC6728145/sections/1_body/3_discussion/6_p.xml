 <xref rid="pone.0221439.ref068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>]). Species more sensitive to Quaternary climate change did not survive into modern times and were not included in our models. As such, we did not capture the effects of Quaternary climate change on current ungulates, Carnivores and Xenarthra. Nonetheless, species belonging to these taxa are still threatened by future climate change and general environmental variation [
