<p class="p">Our results from ecological niche modeling, the standard conceptual and analytical tool to address climate change in a macroecological perspective, support our predictions and show that Quaternary dynamics of climatic suitability and species geographical ranges are correlated to the current mammalâ€™s extinction risk. Species that benefited from climate change with large range expansions and population increases since the LGM are currently less prone to extinction (non-threatened mammals) than species showing range contractions and population decreases to some extent (threatened mammals).</p>
