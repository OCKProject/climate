<p class="p">Stable areas where species persisted in both present-day and LGM are all located in the tropics (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221439.g003" class="xref">Fig 3A</xref>). Most species gained suitable habitats continuously across the Palearctic and Nearctic, and in a disjunctive manner in Indonesia, the Neotropic (Central America and along the northwest and east coasts of South America) and Afrotropic (west equatorial Africa) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221439.g003" class="xref">Fig 3B</xref>). Species lost suitable habitats across the tropical regions over the last ice age, especially in the western Amazon basin, west equatorial Africa and Southeast Asia (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221439.g003" class="xref">Fig 3C</xref>). However, when combined with stable habitats, Nearctic presented the greatest proportional loss of species, together with Palearctic and Indomalaya realms (
