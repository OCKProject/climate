<p class="p">Range contraction and decline in suitability alone explained 11.3% and 13.8% of mammal's extinction risk, respectively, and 36% and 39% when combined with body size (
 <xref rid="pone.0221439.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Extinction risks for Afrotheria, Eulipotyphla, Lagomorpha, Rodentia and Primates were better explained by both range and suitability dynamics through the last ice age than for Chiroptera, Metatheria, and Ungulata. Extinction risks for Ferae, Xenarthra and minor clades were not significantly related to range and suitability dynamics (
