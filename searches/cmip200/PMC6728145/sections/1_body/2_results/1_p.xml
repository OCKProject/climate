Overall, 47% of threatened species underwent range contractions compared to only 24.1% of non-threatened species. Similarly, 53% of threatened species had range expansions against 75.9% of non-threatened species (t = 13.409; df = 1004.2; p&lt;0.001). Mean suitability decreased for 46% of threatened species compared to only 20.8% of non-threatened species, and increased for 70.2% of non-threatened and 54% of threatened species (t = 14.873; df = 1154.5; p&lt;0.001). Amongst non-threatened species Eulipotyphla presented the greatest range expansion (92.9%), and Lagomorpha had the greatest range contraction amongst threatened species (-63.9%). Suitability increased for all non-threatened species and decreases occurred only for threatened Afrotheria, Eulipotyphla, Lagomorpha and Rodentia (
