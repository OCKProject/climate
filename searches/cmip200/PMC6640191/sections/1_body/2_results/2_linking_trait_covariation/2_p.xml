<p class="p">The RDA showed that climate was the major determinant of trait variation for most of the traits examined. At the species level, the calibrated accuracy (adjusted R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> between observed and predicted values) was satisfactory at 0.16 for SLA, 0.3 for

 <sub class="sub">area</sub>, and 0.84 for LAI (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" class="xref">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). The average adjusted R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> across traits was 0.43, which was higher than that obtained by

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>), tropical, subtropical and temperate forests had high SLA values, while tundra and alpine steppe usually had low SLA values. Alpine steppe, tundra and temperate steppe had higher

 <sub class="sub">area</sub> values, and tropical and subtropical forests had lower 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>
 <sub class="sub">area</sub> values. Tropical and subtropical forests had a higher LAI, while temperate steppe and alpine steppe had a lower LAI. The vegetation types were characterized by different trait combinations, which make it possible to classify trait prediction values into different vegetation types with the help of GMM.
