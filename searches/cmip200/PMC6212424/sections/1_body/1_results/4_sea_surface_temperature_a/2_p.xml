 </sup>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5b</xref> shows that Arctic sea ice loss weakens the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC); the northward mass flux systematically decreases all the way from the subtropics to the subpolar North Atlantic. The decrease in the northward mass flux in the Atlantic Ocean is largest around 35°N–50°N (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5b</xref>) and the poleward margin of this region is where the annual-mean SSTs decrease by around 0.5 K (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4a, b</xref>). However, the AMOC strength slowly recovers to the control simulation (i.e. mid-Holocene climate with preindustrial sea ice) strength after about 180 years (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5a</xref>). After year 200, the AMOC strength anomalies are mostly smaller than 1 Sverdrup (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5a, c</xref>), which is consistent with a previous study

 </sup> showing that the AMOC weakening is a transient response to the Arctic sea ice loss. Therefore, it is unlikely that the AMOC weakening and the associated North Atlantic cooling persisted throughout the mid-Holocene. While the AMOC weakening signal substantially diminishes after year 200, the North Atlantic cooling still persists (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5g</xref>), suggesting that the AMOC weakening is not the only factors causing the North Atlantic cooling. The sea surface height (SSH) anomalies show that Arctic sea ice loss decreases SSH over the mid-North Atlantic (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5d, e</xref>), which weakens the Gulf Stream by reducing the meridional gradient of the SSH. The reduced strength of the Gulf Stream is likely to be a factor for the North Atlantic cooling, which is qualitatively consistent with a previous study
