<p id="Par10" class="p">These atmospheric circulation and SAT changes are also associated with sea surface temperature (SST) changes. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4c</xref> shows that the direct insolation forcing increases the annual-mean North Sea and the Mediterranean Sea SSTs by around 0.2–0.3 K. This SST warming likely contributes to the increase in annual-mean SAT over Europe (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b</xref>). The Hovmöller plot of the North Atlantic SSTs averaged between 55°W and 10°W indicates that the SST anomalies increase rapidly in summer because of anomalously strong summer insolation, but quickly subside in autumn and become slightly negative in spring (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4d</xref>). In contrast, Arctic sea ice loss produces seasonally persistent SST anomalies in the mid-high latitudes. Arctic sea ice loss increases the annual-mean North Pacific SSTs by around 0.4–0.5 K and produces a localized ~0.5 K decrease in annual-mean SSTs in the central North Atlantic (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4a</xref>). The Hovmöller plot of North Atlantic SSTs shows that the sea ice loss decreases (increases) the mid-latitude (subpolar) North Atlantic SSTs throughout the season (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4b</xref>), and that these anomalies exhibit far less seasonality than those of the insolation forcing. The summed effects of insolation forcing and sea ice loss exhibit a pattern of North Pacific–subpolar North Atlantic warming and tropical ocean cooling (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">4</xref>). This is qualitatively consistent with the PMIP3 multi-model average (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">4</xref>), with the exception of the North Pacific warming.
