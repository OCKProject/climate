<p id="Par7" class="p">The influence of Arctic sea ice loss on Northern Hemisphere climate is particularly pronounced during winter, from December to March (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a</xref>): SAT over the Eurasian continent, specifically Central and East Asia, decreases by ~0.6 K. This result is comparable to model-simulated eastern Eurasian continent cooling due to the recent sea ice decline

 </sup>. This Eurasian continent cooling occurs mostly in early winter (December–January), during which SAT decreases by 0.8 K over wide areas of Central and East Asia (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>). The decrease in SAT over the Eurasian continent is associated with the development of anomalously high sea level pressure (SLP) in Arctic and sub-Arctic Russia and the deepening of the Aleutian low (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>), consistent with a recent projection of Arctic sea ice loss
