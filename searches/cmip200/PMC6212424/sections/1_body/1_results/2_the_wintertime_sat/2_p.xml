<p id="Par8" class="p">Over North America, the anomalous winter insolation decreases SAT by more than 2 K (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b</xref>), which is not surprising given that the winter insolation weakens by 5–10 W m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> and land has a relatively low heat capacity. On the contrary, the sea ice loss increases SAT by 2 K, especially over Alaska and Canada (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a</xref>). This is partly because of the Aleutian low strengthening (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>), which is followed by the northward transport of warm southern air to Alaska and western Canada
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>
 </sup>, increasing SAT over these regions. This wintertime surface warming over North America also appears in a climate model simulation of a projected Arctic sea ice loss, forced by RCP 8.5 with a well-resolved stratosphere

 </sup>. This suggests that without the effect of sea ice loss, the weakening of winter insolation would have led to harsher winters over North America during the mid-Holocene. The summed effects of insolation forcing and sea ice loss on SAT manifest as a warm Arctic and cold continent pattern in winter, consistent with the Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project phase 3 (PMIP3) multi-model average (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref>). The wintertime Arctic warming in the PMIP3 multi-model average is generally weaker than that in CESM1, though the 4 warmest of the PMIP3 models simulate Arctic warming that is comparable to CESM1 (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref>).
