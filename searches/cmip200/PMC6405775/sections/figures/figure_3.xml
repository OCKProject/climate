   <bold class="bold">b</bold>) is the same as in 
   <bold class="bold">a</bold> except that the SST anomaly is obtained by subtracting the tropical (30° N–30° S) mean SST. Contours show ensemble mean SST and SST anomaly field for the first 20 years with intervals of 2 K and 1.5 K, respectively. Dotted denotes the region where the responses of 14 or more out of the 21 CMIP5 models are of the same sign
