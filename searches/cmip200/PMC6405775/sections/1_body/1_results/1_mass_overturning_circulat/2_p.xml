 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" class="xref">1a, b</xref> shows the ensemble mean distribution of velocity potential and the associated divergent wind at 200-hPa level and 
 <bold class="bold">Q</bold> averaged in the control run, respectively. Note that the zonal mean total water vapor transport is removed in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b</xref> to emphasize the zonal asymmetry caused by east–west circulations. The associated precipitation rates are given in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1c</xref>. It is found that the spatial structures of velocity potential along with 200-hPa divergent wind, 
 <bold class="bold">Q</bold>, and the precipitation rate obtained from the ensemble mean of 21 CMIP5 preindustrial runs are not much different from those in the control run (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>). This similarity suggests that climate system is not meaningfully perturbed by the additional CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> in the control run (i.e., the first 20-year period); therefore, the difference between the two periods (1–20 years vs. 121–140 years) is considered representative of the atmospheric response to QCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>.
