<p id="Par8" class="p">The well-known Walker circulation is clearly depicted across the tropical Pacific basin. Water vapor convergence and upper-level divergence over the western tropical Pacific indicate the ascending region, connecting to the eastern tropical Pacific descending region where water vapor divergence is clearly shown. It is of importance to note that the 200-hPa level velocity potential shows a dominant wave number 1 pattern. In addition, it is also evident that the local north–south Hadley circulation is prevalent over the Indo-western tropical Pacific region. The geographical distribution of the ensemble model mean precipitation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1c</xref>) agrees reasonably well with the expected precipitation from the water vapor convergence/divergence pattern (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b</xref>). Heavy precipitation areas over the Indo-western Pacific region, Inter-tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), and South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ) coincide with the water vapor convergence areas. The prevailing dry regions over the equatorial eastern Pacific and subtropical oceans coincide with water vapor divergence areas. A similar result is obtained from the ERA-Interim reanalysis dataset

 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" class="xref">2a</xref>). In addition, water vapor convergence and upper-level divergence are prominent over the Indo-western tropical Pacific along with Walker circulation and the local north–south Hadley circulation. It is also evident that much of the precipitation over the Indo-western Pacific region, ITCZ, and SPCZ are closely associated with the water vapor convergence (Supplementary Figs.
