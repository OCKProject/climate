<p id="Par6" class="p">In order to understand the precipitation change over the tropics in a warmer climate, we focus on the mass overturning circulation. We first examine the total water vapor transport (hereafter,

 <bold class="bold">Q</bold>, we also use the divergent wind field at 200-hPa level to describe the upper branch of the circulations linked to the lower-level circulation branch. However, considering that water vapor flux is also a function of water vapor change itself, the effective boundary-layer wind (hereafter,
