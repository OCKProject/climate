<p id="Par14" class="p">It is noteworthy that there is a study pointing out the eastward shift of Walker circulation represented by the zonal stream function in response to global warming, which is mainly associated with a shift toward more El Niño-like mean state due to a long-term trend in ENSO variability pattern

 </sup>. While such an El Niño-like mean state change is also seen in the period of QCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a</xref>), the spatial structure of the mass overturning circulation associated with El Niño events has both similarities and differences (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" class="xref">7a</xref>) compared with that due to QCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (i.e., Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4a</xref>). During El Niño events (see Methods section), the minimum anomalies of mass overturning circulation are located over the eastern part of the Indian Ocean and the Maritime continent, which is similar to the result in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4a</xref>. However, the elongated pattern of positive anomalies extending from the central to the eastern tropical Pacific along with the upper-level mass divergence over the tropical Atlantic Ocean and a far western Indian Ocean does not appear during El Niño events, which is in contrast to that due to QCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4a</xref>). Furthermore, it is also noteworthy that the mean state change of SST due to QCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a</xref>) is somewhat different from the spatial pattern of El Niño events simulated in CMIP5 climate models (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" class="xref">7b</xref>), in particular over the western Indian ocean and equatorial Atlantic.
