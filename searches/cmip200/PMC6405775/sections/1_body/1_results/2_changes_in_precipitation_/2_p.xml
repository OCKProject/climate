<p id="Par10" class="p">A pronounced increase in precipitation due to QCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> is found over the western equatorial Pacific with a maximum increase over the area between 150° E and 160° W. Most of this increased precipitation area nearly corresponds to the local minimum of climatological precipitation area from 150° E to 80° W in the equatorial Pacific, which appears to be in contrast to a wet-get-wetter pattern. On the other hand, the rainfall amount is reduced in the central-to-eastern subtropical Pacific where the climatological precipitation is a minimum, which is consistent with a dry-get-drier pattern in a warmer climate

 </sup>. Therefore, the precipitation change due to QCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> is not fully explained by a thermodynamic process. Furthermore, the details of precipitation changes have both been somewhat contrasting and consistent, when the warmer-get-wetter mechanism is employed. While both the SST warming and the SST increase relative to the tropical mean SST from the first to the last 20 years is a maximum in the eastern equatorial Pacific (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>), a maximum increase of precipitation is found over the western equatorial Pacific (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref>). On the other hand, both the western Indian Ocean and the tropical Atlantic Ocean, where the SST warming relative to the tropical mean SST is significant (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b</xref>), are characterized by a significant increase of precipitation amount due to QCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref>). This could be explained by a warmer-to-wetter mechanism. These results require a further understanding to explain the precipitation change in a warmer climate.
