<p id="Par9" class="p">In order to examine the QCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> influence on tropical precipitation, the precipitation differences between the two ensemble time means (1–20 years vs. 121–140 years) are displayed in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref>. Note that contour lines in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a–c</xref> indicate the ensemble mean precipitation in the control run, which is identical to Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1c</xref> and the precipitation response to QCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> is highly consistent among ensemble members (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref>), which are not due to one or two models driving the maximum in precipitation change. Furthermore, it is indicated that QCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> results are more consistent among climate models, compared with the other two experiments. It is also noteworthy that the precipitation differences between the ensemble mean of 21 CMIP5 preindustrial runs and the response to QCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (121–140 years) (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref>) are similar to that from the first to last 20 years in the quadrupling experiment of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref>).
