 <sub class="sub">E</sub> imply water vapor divergence and convergence, respectively, which explains the precipitation change to QCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>. The increase in the velocity potential roughly corresponds to the increased rainfall amount area between 150° E and 160° W as well as the coast of South America around 90° W (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref> and Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a</xref>). In addition, such an elongated pattern across the tropical Pacific Ocean indicates that the upper-level mass fluxes diverge from the equatorial area toward the subtropical oceans in both hemispheres. This reflects a narrowing of the ITCZ, the enhanced drying of the subtropics, and marginal convective zones of the tropics

 <bold class="bold">V</bold>
 <sub class="sub">E</sub> with precipitation anomalies suggest how precipitation anomalies are formed in response to QCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>: precipitation over the western tropical Pacific is caused by eastward water vapor transport from the Indian Ocean, while precipitation over the central-to-eastern tropical Pacific Ocean is largely due to the equatorward transport of water vapor from subtropical oceans (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" class="xref">9</xref>). This result indicates that the changes in precipitation to QCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> might be linked to regionally confined circulations, i.e., Walker and Hadley circulations. In other words, more regionally developed circulations over the tropical Pacific basin tend to break the trans-Pacific Walker circulation into rather smaller regional scales, leading to greater increases in precipitation in the western equatorial Pacific as compared with the eastern tropical Pacific.
