<p id="Par13" class="p">In this study, the details of atmospheric circulation change are examined based on the change in the mass overturning circulation to QCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> to interpret the change in the spatial pattern of rainfall (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). The dominant wave number 1 pattern in 200-hPa velocity potential in the control run (contour in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4a</xref>) tends to be shifted to the east, as noted in the difference field of 200-hPa divergent wind and velocity potential (shading in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4a</xref>). While the wave number 1 pattern in velocity potential at 200-hPa is still dominant in the period of QCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (i.e., 121–140 years) (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" class="xref">5</xref>), a wavenumber 1.5–2 perturbation field of velocity potential is established (see also Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" class="xref">6</xref>). The oval-type minimum anomalies centered over Malaysia indicate an upper-level mass convergence over the area covering the eastern part of the Indian Ocean and the Maritime continent (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4a</xref>), which is connected with an upper-level mass divergence over the tropical Atlantic Ocean and a far western part of the Indian Ocean where the SST warming relative to the tropical mean SST is significant with an increase of precipitation amount, in response to QCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b</xref>). The strongest decrease in the velocity potential roughly corresponds to the area showing the decreased precipitation over the western part of the Maritime continent and the eastern Indian Ocean (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref>). We argue that the enhanced precipitation in the far western Indian Ocean and the tropical Atlantic Ocean (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref>), which could be explained by the warmer-get-wetter mechanism, acts to shift the convergence/divergence structure of Walker circulation to the east in a warmer climate. On the other hand, the much elongated pattern of positive anomalies extends from the central tropical Pacific to the eastern tropical Pacific over 10° N–10° S and appears to be dynamically connected to the negative anomalies located in the west (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4a</xref>). This dipole-like distribution may suggest a link between the two regions, establishing the upper branch of the Pacific Walker circulation. However, considering that perturbed velocity is mostly linked in the north–south direction over most of the central and eastern tropical Pacific, the equatorial area extending from the central tropical Pacific to the eastern tropical Pacific is subject to more of a north–south aligned outflow from the latitudinal belt along the equator.
