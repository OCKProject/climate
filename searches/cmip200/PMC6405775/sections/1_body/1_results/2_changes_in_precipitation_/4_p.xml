<p id="Par12" class="p">The change in the precipitation rate over the tropical Pacific to QCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref>), i.e., greater increases in the western equatorial Pacific as compared with the central-to-eastern tropical Pacific, may be caused by an increased intensity of Walker circulation with a more zonally expanded pattern. This seems contradictory to the expected weakening of the Walker circulation under the global warming conditions found in most coupled climate models

 </sup>. Using a typical index based on the sea-level pressure (SLP) difference between the ascending and descending regions

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">38</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">39</xref>
 </sup> (see Methods section), it is obvious that the intensity of the Walker circulation to QCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> gradually decreases (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" class="xref">4</xref>). This result raises a question, i.e., how can weakening of the Walker circulation explain the change in the precipitation rate of the tropical Pacific to QCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>? The answer might be that the pressure changes defining the Walker circulation are not only influenced by east–west-coupled Walker circulation but also by the north–south local Hadley circulation. Therefore, a weakening of the Walker circulation in a warmer climate, which is based on a typical index using the east–west difference of SLP, might be oversimplified and there may be changes in the structure of Walker circulation due to both thermodynamics and dynamical responses, affecting rainfall change.
