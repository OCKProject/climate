 </sup>, excluding other greenhouse gases (GHGs) and aerosols. To underpin the impact of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration increase on the tropical circulation, the 1% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> experiment outputs from the 21 climate models are averaged for the multi-model ensemble mean, representing the climate variability forced by CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> change. We consider the first 20-year (1–20 years) simulations as a control run. Since an annual 1% increase of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration results in approximately a quadrupling of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentrations in the last 20 years of the 140-year analysis period (i.e., 121–140 years), the difference between the two periods (1–20 years vs. 121–140 years) is considered to be the precipitation response to quadrupling of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration. We also analyze outputs from doubling and tripling CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration experiments from 21 CMIP5 model simulations (see the Methods section) and 21 CMIP5 preindustrial simulations (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>) to ensure that the results based on the quadrupling experiment of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration are representative. Note that the responses due to doubling and tripling of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration were similar to those from the quadrupling except with stronger signals in the quadrupling of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. Thus, in this study, we mainly provide results from a quadrupling of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration (hereafter referred to as QCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>).
