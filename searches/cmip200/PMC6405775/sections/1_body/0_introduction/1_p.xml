<p id="Par3" class="p">The atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>), which is well known as a strong greenhouse gas, has been gradually increasing since the mid-19th century and will continue to increase in the near future

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>
 </sup>. In addition to a rising of global mean surface temperature, an increase of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration leads to changes in a number of atmospheric and oceanic variables in terms of their spatial pattern and intensity, as well as frequency

 </sup>. Among them, the tropical Pacific precipitation changes due to the increase of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration have received much attention because precipitation is one of the most important parameters of the hydrological cycle, as well as the ecological environment

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>
