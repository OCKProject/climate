<p id="Par4" class="p">Most previous studies examining the precipitation change in the tropical Pacific under the warmer climate are based upon the analysis of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Projection Phase 5 (CMIP5) climate model results. Precipitation change in a warmer climate is often characterized as a wet-get-wetter/dry-get-drier pattern

 </sup>. While the wet-get-wetter/dry-get-drier pattern thermodynamically interprets an increasing atmospheric water vapor content and transport following the Clausius–Clapeyron relation, the warmer-get-wetter mechanism dynamically interprets the cause of precipitation pattern change in the tropics. Specifically, the warmer-get-wetter mechanism indicates that the precipitation changes in the tropics are positively correlated with the spatial deviations of SST warming relative to the tropical mean SST, because the moist instability is determined by the relative SST changes. Although these two mechanisms reasonably well explain precipitation changes in a warmer climate, future projection of rainfall patterns is still a challenging issue

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> quadrupling experiment results, we shed a new insight on interpreting precipitation change in the tropical Pacific based on two main atmospheric circulations, i.e., Walker and Hadley circulations. Previous studies have emphasized the SST regulations determining the precipitation pattern. Furthermore, recent studies are paying more attention to the respective roles of Walker and Hadley circulation, determining the structure of divergence/convergence driving the pattern of precipitation changes over the tropical Pacific in a warmer climate
