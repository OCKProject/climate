<p id="Par24" class="p">We counted the El Niño event as the year when the Niño 3.4 index during boreal winter (December–January–February, DJF) is above 0.4 °C during the first 20 years in each of the 21 CMIP5 climate models. In order to identify the characteristics of atmospheric states when El Niño occurs, the climatological DJF mean during the entire first 20-year period was subtracted from the years when El Niño occurs.</p>
