<p id="Par23" class="p">We use outputs from 21 CMIP5 model simulations based on a 70-year and 111-year experiment with a prescribed 1% per year increase in CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration, respectively, in the doubling and tripling experiment of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration. Similar to the quadrupling experiment, we consider the first 20-year (1–20 years) simulations as a control run in both the doubling and tripling experiment. Since an annual 1% increase of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration results in approximately a doubling (tripling) of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentrations in the last 20 years of the 70-year (111-year) analysis period, i.e., 51–70 years (i.e., 92–111 years), the difference between the two periods, i.e., 1–20 years vs. 51–70 years (1–20 years vs. 92–111 years) is considered to be the precipitation response to doubling (tripling) of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration.
