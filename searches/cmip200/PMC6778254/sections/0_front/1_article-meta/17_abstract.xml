 <p class="p">Climate observations comprise one sequence of natural internal variability and the response to external forcings. Large initial condition ensembles (LEs) performed with a single climate model provide many different sequences of internal variability and forced response. LEs allow analysts to quantify random uncertainty in the time required to detect forced “fingerprint” patterns. For tropospheric temperature, the consistency between fingerprint detection times in satellite data and in 2 different LEs depends primarily on the size of the simulated warming in response to greenhouse gas increases and the simulated cooling caused by anthropogenic aerosols. Consistency is closest for a model with high sensitivity and large aerosol-driven cooling. Assessing whether this result is physically reasonable will require reducing currently large aerosol forcing uncertainties.</p>
