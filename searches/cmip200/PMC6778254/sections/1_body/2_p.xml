<p class="p">Few previous fingerprint studies have exploited LEs (
 <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>). Our study uses LEs to quantify stochastic uncertainty in the detection time of global and hemispheric fingerprint patterns and assesses whether this stochastic uncertainty encompasses the actual fingerprint detection times in observations. We employ LEs performed with 2 different climate models for this purpose. We also compare information from local S/N analysis at individual grid points with results from the S/N analysis of large-scale patterns.
