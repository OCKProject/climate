<p class="p">For CanESM2, additional 50-member LEs were available with combined solar and volcanic effects only (SV) and with individual anthropogenic forcing by ozone (OZONE), aerosols (AERO), and well-mixed greenhouse gases (GHG). These ensembles allow us to quantify the contributions of different forcings to temperature changes in the CanESM2 ALL experiment. Comparable LEs were not available from CESM1 at the time this research was performed.</p>
