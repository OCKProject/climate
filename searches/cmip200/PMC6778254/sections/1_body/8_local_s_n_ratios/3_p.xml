<p class="p">The tropics also have advantages for identifying tropospheric warming. As a result of moist thermodynamic processes (
 <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>), TMT trends are largest in the tropics. Tropical noise levels are relatively small. This spatial congruence of high signal strength and low noise yields large S/N ratios for tropical TMT trends (

S/N ratios for TLT trends reach maximum values between 30°N and 30°S, where signal strength is more moderate but noise levels are small (
