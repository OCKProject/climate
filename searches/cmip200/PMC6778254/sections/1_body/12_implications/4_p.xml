<p class="p">How might we determine whether CanESM2 or CESM1 has a more realistic estimate of the true tropospheric temperature response to combined anthropogenic and natural external forcing? One way of addressing this question involves applying pattern-based regression methods (

 <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>
 <xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref"/>–
 <xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>) to quantify the strength of the model-predicted GHG and AERO fingerprints in observational data. Ideally, single-forcing GHG and AERO LEs would be available for this purpose. This would facilitate direct comparison of the regression coefficients (typically referred to as “scaling factors”) for the CanESM2 and CESM1 fingerprints. At the time this research was performed, single-forcing GHG and AERO LEs were available from CanESM2 but not CESM1. Comparison of scaling factors in the 2 models was not feasible.
