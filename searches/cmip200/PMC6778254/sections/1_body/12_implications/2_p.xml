<p class="p">Clearly, ECS is not the sole determinant of consistency between fingerprint detection times in observations and in a model LE. The applied forcing must also have significant impact. The cooling associated with (highly uncertain) negative indirect anthropogenic aerosol forcing is substantially greater in CESM1 than in CanESM2 (
