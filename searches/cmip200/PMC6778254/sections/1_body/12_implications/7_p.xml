<p class="p">In terms of reducing climate sensitivity uncertainties, there are now more mature strategies for evaluating the robustness and physical plausibility of a wide array of “emergent constraints” on ECS (

 <xref rid="r51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref"/>–
 <xref rid="r52" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>). Additionally, Bayesian inference strategies are being employed for combining information from the often divergent results obtained with different emergent constraints.
