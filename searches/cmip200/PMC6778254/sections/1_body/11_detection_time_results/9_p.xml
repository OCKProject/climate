<p class="p">Detection times for model TLS fingerprints are similar in the 3 satellite datasets (

  <italic class="italic">B</italic>
 </xref>). This is due to 2 factors: long-term lower stratospheric cooling trends that differ by less than 25% in RSS, STAR, and UAH and the “synchronization” of TLS changes for several years after the Pinatubo eruption. In contrast, detection times for model TMT and TLT fingerprints are (in all but 2 cases) later in UAH than in RSS or STAR. Delayed detection occurs because UAH shows reduced long-term tropospheric warming relative to RSS and STAR (
