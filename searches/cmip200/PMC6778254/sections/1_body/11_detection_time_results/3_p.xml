<p class="p">There are 2 striking features of the model-only results. First, the CanESM2 and CESM1 ALL fingerprints are always detected earlier in the stratosphere than in the troposphere. Across regions, noise estimates, and the 2 model ALL LEs,

 </inline-formula> varies from 1994 to 1996 for TLS and from 1997 to 2003 for both TMT and TLT. These differences in fingerprint detection time are primarily related to the effects of the Pinatubo eruption, which temporarily mask anthropogenic cooling of the lower stratosphere and anthropogenic warming of the troposphere. Because ocean thermal inertia has a smaller effect on stratospheric than on tropospheric temperature, this masking effect decays more rapidly in TLS than in TMT or TLT.
