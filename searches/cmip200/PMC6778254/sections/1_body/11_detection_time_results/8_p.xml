 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref> also provides information on the relative detectability of fingerprints in the 3 geographical domains. The most obvious differences are in the troposphere, where fingerprint detection occurs earlier in the NH than in the SH. This result reflects hemispheric differences in landâ€“ocean distribution, heat capacity, and sea ice and snow cover changes.
