<p class="p">Observed lower stratospheric cooling over 1979 to 2018 ranges from −0.30 °C to −0.23 °C per decade (for UAH and RSS, respectively). TLS trends are always smaller in CanESM2, which has an ensemble range of −0.18 °C to −0.14 °C per decade. This difference may be partly due to underestimated ozone loss in the observational dataset used to prescribe CanESM2 ozone changes (
