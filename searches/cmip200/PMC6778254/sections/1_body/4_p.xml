<p class="p">Our focus is on the temperature of the lower stratosphere (TLS), the temperature of the mid- to upper troposphere (TMT), and the temperature of the lower troposphere (TLT), which have not been analyzed in previous LE studies. Satellite-based microwave sounders have monitored the temperatures of these 3 layers since late 1978 (

 <xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>). In both LEs, the models were driven by estimated historical changes in all major anthropogenic and natural external forcings (henceforth “ALL”).
