<p content-type="flushleft" class="p">Large initial condition ensembles (LEs) are routinely performed by climate modeling groups (
 <xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>
 <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref"/>–
 <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>). Typical LE sizes range from 30 to 100. Individual LE members are generated with the same model and external forcings, but are initialized from different conditions of the climate system (
 <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>). Each LE member provides a unique realization of the “noise” of natural internal variability superimposed on the underlying climate “signal” (the response to the applied changes in forcing).
