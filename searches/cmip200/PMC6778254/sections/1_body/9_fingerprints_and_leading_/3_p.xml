<p class="p">It was not evident a priori that the multimodel ensemble of CMIP5 control runs and the single-model between-realization variability in CanESM2 would yield similar internal variability patterns. This suggests that the patterns in

  <italic class="italic">SI Appendix</italic>, Figs. S4 and S5
 </ext-link> are primarily dictated by large-scale modes of stratospheric and tropospheric temperature variability that are well captured in CanESM2 and the multimodel ensemble. It is also noteworthy that the magnitude and type of external forcing in the CanESM2 ALL and SV LEs do not appear to significantly modulate the large-scale spatial structure of the leading modes of atmospheric temperature variability. Forced modulation of certain modes of internal variability has been reported elsewhere (
