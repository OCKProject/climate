<p class="p">We used gridded, monthly mean satellite atmospheric temperature data from RSS (
 <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>), STAR (
 <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>), and UAH (
 <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>). RSS and UAH provide satellite measurements of TLS, TMT, and TLT. STAR produces TLS and TMT data only. Temperature data were available for January 1979 to December 2018 for versions 4.0 of RSS, 4.1 of STAR, and 6.0 of UAH.
