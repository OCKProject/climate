<p class="p">We analyzed simulation output from five 50-member LEs: ALL, SV, AERO, OZONE, and GHG. For the first 4 ensembles, CanESM2 was run over the 1950 to 2005 period with forcing by ALL, SV, AERO, and OZONE. After 2005 each of these 4 numerical experiments continued with the forcing appropriate for that ensemble from the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) scenario (
