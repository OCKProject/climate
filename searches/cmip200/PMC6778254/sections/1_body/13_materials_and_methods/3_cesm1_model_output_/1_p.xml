<p class="p">The 40-member CESM1-CAM5 ALL ensemble is described in detail elsewhere (
 <xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>). The initial 30-member ensemble was augmented with 10 additional realizations. All realizations have the same historical forcing from 1920 to 2005 and RCP8.5 forcing from 2006 to 2100. As for the CanESM2 LEs, only the atmospheric initial conditions were varied by imposing small random differences on the air temperature field of realization 1 (
