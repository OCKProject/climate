 <p class="p">We acknowledge the World Climate Research Programme’s Working Group on Coupled Modeling, which is responsible for CMIP, and we thank the climate modeling groups for producing and making available their model output. For CMIP, the US Department of Energy’s Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison provides coordinating support and led development of software infrastructure in partnership with the Global Organization for Earth System Science Portals. We also acknowledge the Environment and Climate Change Canada’s Canadian Center for Climate Modeling and Analysis for executing and making available the CanESM2 Large Ensemble simulations used in this study and the Canadian Sea Ice and Snow Evolution Network for proposing the simulations. Helpful comments were provided by Stephen Po-Chedley, Neil Swart, Mike MacCracken, and Ralph Young. Work at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) was performed under the auspices of the US Department of Energy under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344 through the Regional and Global Model Analysis Program (to B.D.S., J.F.P., M.D.Z., and G.P.) and the Early Career Research Program Award SCW1295 (to C.B.).
