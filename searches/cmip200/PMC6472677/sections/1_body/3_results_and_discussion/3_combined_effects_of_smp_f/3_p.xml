<p class="p">The combination of negative (hereafter, N) Ys and positive (hereafter, P) Yt occurs predominantly in the observations. While each observational estimate shows a similar fraction of land area, the regions where the combination appears vary across different observational data sets (Figure

 <xref rid="grl58562-supinf-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">supporting information</xref>). An important implication of this combination (NYs‐PYt) is that the majority of the afternoon rainfall events occur when the whole event domain is anomalously wet, since the location of maximum afternoon precipitation occurs over a grid cell with positive soil moisture anomaly in the morning (PYt), while the surrounding grid cells have even higher soil moisture anomaly (NYs). Therefore, the dominant positive heterogeneity metric across all observed estimations (Figure 
 <xref rid="grl58562-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>, lower left) indicates high heterogeneity among positive soil moisture anomalies, which should be distinguished from high heterogeneity due to mixture of dry and wet soil moisture anomalies. The other dominant combination in observations is NYs‐NYt. This combination still reflects significantly more frequent afternoon rainfall occurrence over regions drier than their surroundings but also less precipitation persistence due to NYt. In addition, this combination does not reveal the large‐scale soil moisture condition in the entire event domain, unlike the former, and thus, there is larger uncertainty in how the positive Yh is driven. It should be noted that in Figure 
 <xref rid="grl58562-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>, the combination of positive spatial and positive temporal metrics (PYs‐PYt) also seems to appear relatively often. However, looking at the maps of the metrics (Figure 
 <xref rid="grl58562-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S2</xref>) reveals that this cooccurrence in fact stems from various, randomly distributed grid cells and does not cluster into consistent regions. Therefore, this signal appears not robust and should be interpreted with caution.
