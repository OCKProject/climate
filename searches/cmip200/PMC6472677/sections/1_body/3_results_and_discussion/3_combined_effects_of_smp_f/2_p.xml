<p class="p">Figure 
 <xref rid="grl58562-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> shows the fraction of land areas that feature combinations of the spatial and temporal SMP feedback metrics (top row) and heterogeneity feedback metric (bottom row) in observations and models. Results of the same analysis using different significant levels are presented in the

 <xref rid="grl58562-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S5</xref>). Only 5° × 5° boxes of which more than a third are land areas were classified as land are considered, and the ratio of land area is calculated with area‐weighted composition. Analyzing Ys and Yt in a combined way allows for a more comprehensive comparison of the prerainfall morning soil moisture conditions between observations and models. Additionally, with the consideration of Yh, we discuss possible mechanisms behind the commonly found combinations of SMP feedback metrics in both observations and models and how they potentially contribute to the spatial and temporal structure of precipitation persistence.
