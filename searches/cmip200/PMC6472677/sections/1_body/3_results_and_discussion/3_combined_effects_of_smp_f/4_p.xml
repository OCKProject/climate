<p class="p">In models, the combination of positive Ys and Yt (PYs‐PYt) appears as the most common and is, unlike in observations, also confirmed by the maps in Figure 
 <xref rid="grl58562-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S3</xref>. This combination indicates localized (grid scale) dry or wet persistence as it means that afternoon rainfall occurs more frequently over the temporally and spatially wetter regions. This is opposed to the observational estimates. PYs‐NYt is the second most common combination in the models. PYs‐NYt indicates that afternoon rainfall is more likely under dry soil condition and occurs over wetter regions in a given area. Thus, under this combination of feedbacks increase in precipitation likelihood might be only possible when there are sufficient drying down periods between the precipitation events, indicating a system with low precipitation persistence or high evaporative demands. The fraction of areas with different signs of Yh varies substantially across different models, but for each given model, the fractions of NYh and PYh are comparable. CNRM‐CM5 appears as the only model where fraction of land areas with negative Ys and significant Yt is larger than 10%. IPSL‐CM5A‐MR simulates dominantly positive signals in all three metrics.
