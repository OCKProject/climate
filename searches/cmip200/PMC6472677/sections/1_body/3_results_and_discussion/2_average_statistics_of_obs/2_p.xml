Spatial SMP feedback (Ys) in the models is dominantly positive as opposed to generally nonsignificant or negative Ys in observations. The highest fraction of models simulating positive Ys is found in South America, South Africa, and northern Australia. C. M. Taylor, deÂ Jeu, et al. (
 <xref rid="grl58562-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>) also found dominantly positive Ys in model simulations of the Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project that are forced with prescribed sea surface temperature. Some models still capture negative Ys in the western part of Sahel, which appears as one of the regions with the strongest negative Ys in the observations. In North America and North Asia, most of the models simulate nonsignificant Ys.
