<p class="p">The temporal feedback (Yt) in the models shows better agreement with observations than the other two feedback metrics. Positive Yt in Australia, South Africa, North Asia, and India and negative Yt in western South America and western Sahel are reasonably well captured by the models. Yet in North America the models show very different behavior compared to observations, with strong negative Yt in the eastern part. Larger variability across the models is found in central North America, western and southern parts of Brazil, and central Africa (indicated by light purple). Note also that large‐scale factors such as the North Atlantic Oscillation, El Niño/Southern Oscillation, or sea surface temperature variability could substantially affect precipitation persistence, which in turn may lead to a spurious correlation between soil moisture and subsequent precipitation (Guillod et al.,

 <xref rid="grl58562-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>). For instance, precipitation persistence at the time scale of the order of weeks induced by oceanic or atmospheric processes could lead to a positive temporal metric even in the absence of SMP feedback mechanism (Orlowsky &amp; Seneviratne,

 <xref rid="grl58562-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). Although we cannot exclude such artifacts, the temporal feedback metric allows for a comparison between observations and models while providing an indication on the temporal feedback (Guillod et al., 
 <xref rid="grl58562-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). We note that the temporal metric also exhibits a negative sign in some regions, for example, parts of the Sahel and Southern Great Plains, indicating that the metric does not systematically identify positive coupling mechanisms.
