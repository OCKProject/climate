 <xref rid="grl58562-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref>). In addition, we note that observations and models also show substantially different spatial coverage of the feedback metrics, reflecting that a lower number of events are detected in several models (Figure 
 <xref rid="grl58562-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="grl58562-supinf-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">supporting information</xref>), since the same threshold for the minimum number of events is applied for both models and observation to ensure the statistical significance of estimated SMP feedback metrics. These differences in the number of analyzed precipitation events can be due to differences in spatial resolution (leading to more events in observations compared to models) and in the length of the time series (more events in models). In addition, a part of the difference may be due to the known drizzle issue, that is, an overestimated frequency of light intensity precipitation, in GCMs (Dai,

 <xref rid="grl58562-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Hence, masking out the days with morning precipitation could be more critical for SMP diagnostics in the models.
