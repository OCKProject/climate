<p class="p">While the heterogeneity feedback (Yh) is dominantly positive or nonsignificant in observations, around 50% of the models capture positive Yh correctly but show negative Yh in most of the regions where observations indicate nonsignificant Yh. In observations, Yt and Yh generally have a positive sign, if statistically significant. In the models, similarity between Yt and Yh is much stronger than in observations.</p>
