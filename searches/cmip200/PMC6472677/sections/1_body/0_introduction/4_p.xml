<p class="p">Previous studies mainly point to the spatial resolution of models and thereby parameterization of convection as the main issue that may prevent GCMs from correctly simulating SMP feedbacks. Nonetheless, there is a lack of understanding in how such feedbacks are represented in current GCMs, especially with respect to their spatial and temporal components. In this study, for the first time we evaluate both spatial and temporal SMP feedbacks in a large ensemble of fully coupled climate models using the diagnostics introduced by C. M. Taylor, deÂ Jeu, et al. (

 <xref rid="grl58562-sec-0002" ref-type="sec" class="xref">2</xref> describes the observational data and models used in the analysis. Section

 <xref rid="grl58562-sec-0010" ref-type="sec" class="xref">4.2</xref>, the possible collective effects of spatial and temporal SMP feedbacks in observations and models are discussed. Conclusions are drawn in section
