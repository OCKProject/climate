 <xref rid="grl58562-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>) have demonstrated that observations display a negative spatial SMP feedback, contrary to global climate models (GCMs), which display a positive feedback. This misrepresentation of SMP feedback in GCMs suggests issues in the dynamics of rainfall and soil moisture and could introduce systematic errors in the climate simulated by these models. Many studies have assessed the feedback in GCMs using different approaches, including modeling experiments. Koster et al. (
 <xref rid="grl58562-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>) investigated the relative strength of the SMP feedback across GCMs in terms of precipitation variability explained by soil moisture and highlighted regions with stronger coupling such as the Sahel and central North America. Several regional studies analyzed the development of convective rainfall in model simulations with different soil moisture perturbations, in, for example, South Africa (Cook et al.,

 <xref rid="grl58562-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1994</xref>), the Alpine region (Hohenegger et al., 
 <xref rid="grl58562-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>), and the Sahel (C. M. Taylor et al., 
 <xref rid="grl58562-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). These studies commonly concluded that simulations with parameterized convection, as applied in most of the GCMs, are not able to simulate negative feedbacks. In addition, although the previous studies have proven the substantial contribution of parameterized convection to SMP feedback in models, the role of the land surface schemes should not be overlooked as surface variability induced from land surface processes is likely to influence the development of convection and thus the SMP feedback itself.
