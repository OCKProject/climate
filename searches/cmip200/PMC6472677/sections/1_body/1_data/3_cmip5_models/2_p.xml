<p class="p">GCM output data from historical simulations, for the period 1976–2005, from the CMIP5 (K. E. Taylor, Stouffer, et al., 
 <xref rid="grl58562-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>) ensemble have been used. A longer time period (compared to observations) was necessary to ensure that enough afternoon rainfall events are captured in models, as their spatial resolutions are much coarser (see also section 
 <xref rid="grl58562-sec-0007" ref-type="sec" class="xref">3</xref>). Hence, we assume that SMP feedback characteristics have remained constant over the considered time period (1976–2011). Models with 3‐hourly precipitation and surface soil moisture output available at a spatial resolution finer than 2.5° × 2.5° were chosen, leading to the nine GCMs listed in Table 
 <xref rid="grl58562-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref> together with a few relevant properties. A longitude‐based time adjustment was also conducted to ensure that model outputs are arranged along local time. The surface soil moisture output of the models used in this study represents the uppermost 10 cm, except for CNRM‐CM5 of which represents the top 1 cm.
