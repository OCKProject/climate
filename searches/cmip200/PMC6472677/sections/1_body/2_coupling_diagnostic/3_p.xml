<p class="p">For each day, accumulated afternoon precipitation (12 p.m. to 12 a.m.) is analyzed. Locations of precipitation maxima (Lmax, more than 4 mm) are first identified. An event domain (Levt) is subsequently defined as 5 × 5 grid cells centered at the Lmax locations, and locations of minimum rainfall on that day within Levt are called Lmin. Grid cells with highly varying topography, water bodies or morning (6 a.m. to 12 p.m.) accumulated precipitation larger than 1 mm were masked out. The three metrics are then identified based on these locations as follows: The spatial metric Ys is defined as

The seasonal cycle of soil moisture was calculated by applying 31‐day moving average filter to a multiyear daily climatology. In the case of multiple Lmins due to zero precipitation,
