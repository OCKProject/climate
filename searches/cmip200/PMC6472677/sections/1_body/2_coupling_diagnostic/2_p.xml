A set of three metrics, which assess the sensitivity of afternoon rainfall occurrence to morning soil moisture spatially, temporally and in terms of heterogeneity, are calculated for each afternoon precipitation event. In this section, we first provide a description of the methodology as applied to the observational data, and we then describe the differences introduced for the analysis of models at the end of this section.
