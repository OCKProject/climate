<p class="p">The models and observations differ in terms of their spatial resolution. In addition, climate models consistently have an early initiation of afternoon rainfall compared to observations (Dai,

 <xref rid="grl58562-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>) and process observed and modeled data differently; time steps were used with a 3‐hr shift in models (9 a.m. to 9 p.m. for afternoon, 3 a.m. to 9 a.m. for morning precipitation, and 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. for morning soil moisture), and Levt consists of 3 × 3 grid cells around Lmax instead of 5 × 5.
