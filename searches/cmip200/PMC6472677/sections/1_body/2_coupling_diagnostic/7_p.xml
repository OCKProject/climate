<p class="p">As mentioned earlier, the comparatively coarse spatial resolution of climate models requires parameterization of convection and this might itself affect the SMP feedback. We note that in previous studies (C. M. Taylor, deÂ Jeu, et al., 
 <xref rid="grl58562-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>), the metrics chosen to assess the SMP feedback were additionally calculated at coarser resolutions from observations, which resulted in weaker but consistent sign of the metrics. We find similar results in the

 <xref rid="grl58562-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref>), suggesting that the spatial resolution of the data on which the metrics are computed does not qualitatively affect the results. Nonetheless, the coarser spatial resolution of models compared to observations may cause the former to capture only the largest or most widespread events, while the observations capture many more smaller events. It should be noted that the metrics do not explicitly account for atmospheric preconditions (apart from the filter for morning rainfall, which ensures that rainfall was not already present in the morning), which might determine the preferred soil moisture condition or in some cases inhibit moist convection (Findell &amp; Eltahir,
