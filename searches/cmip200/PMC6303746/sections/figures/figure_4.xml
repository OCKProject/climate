  <p class="p">Survival and 95% confidence intervals of adult female spectacled eiders as a function of (a) extreme sea ice conditions at the wintering area (number days per year with sea ice concentrations &gt;95%) and (b) minimal ice conditions (number of days per year with sea ice concentrations &lt;15%). The gray line and shading represents predicted survival under sea ice conditions lower than observed during our study period. Black circles indicate survival estimates from the model 
   <italic class="italic">p</italic>(year + age)
   <italic class="italic">φ</italic>(year, adults only) and black triangles denote survival estimates from the simpler model 
   <italic class="italic">p</italic>(age)
   <italic class="italic">φ</italic>(year, adults only). Both models were used because survival for certain years was not estimated in the fully time‐parameterized model
