 <p class="p">We would like to thank the many field technicians who worked tirelessly to band and resight birds on Kigigak Island and staff at the Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge who provided logistical support. We thank Melissa Gabrielson for compiling the mark recapture dataset, and the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service for allowing us to analyze the data. We thank James Lovvorn for valuable insights on eider foraging ecology and energetics, and Reto Knutti for advice and clarification on how to weight GCM outputs. We also thank Kate Martin and Bryan Daniels for their suggestions on earlier drafts of this paper. This analysis was supported by the NSF ArcSEES program (grant # 1262825). We acknowledge the World Climate Research Programme's Working Group on Coupled Modelling, which is responsible for CMIP, and we thank the climate modeling groups (listed in Supporting Information Table 
  <xref rid="ece34637-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S3</xref>) for producing and making available their model output. For CMIP, the U.S. Department of Energy's Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison provides coordinating support and led development of software infrastructure in partnership with the Global Organization for Earth System Science Portals. Eider data from 1992 to 2004 are available from:
