<p class="p">A maximum likelihood approach using Cormack‐Jolly‐Seber models was used to analyze the mark‐recapture data and estimate apparent survival (
 <italic class="italic">φ</italic>) and resighting probability (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>; Lebreton, Burnham, Clobert, &amp; Anderson, 
 <xref rid="ece34637-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1992</xref>) using Program MARK and a logit‐link function (White &amp; Burnham, 
 <xref rid="ece34637-bib-0067" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1999</xref>). We used an information theoretic approach to assess the relative explanatory ability of different models of 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">φ</italic>, and used an AIC corrected for small sample size and overdispersion (QAIC
 <sub class="sub">c</sub>). AIC scores were adjusted for overdispersion using an overdispersion parameter (ĉ), taken as the ratio of deviance between real and simulated data. We estimated ĉ using the median ĉ method in Program MARK (White &amp; Burnham, 
 <xref rid="ece34637-bib-0067" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1999</xref>), based on the model 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>(year + age)
 <italic class="italic">φ</italic>(year + age). We modeled 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> as a function of year, age, nest success, year + age, year*age, age + nest success, and as a constant (See Supporting Information Table 
 <xref rid="ece34637-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref> for full list of models). We considered three age classes: ducklings (age 30 days to 1 year), second‐year birds (1–2 years), and adults. Birds did not return to the breeding grounds until they were 2 years of age, and we assumed survival from 1 to 2 years of age was equal to adult survival. We were able to estimate 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> for second‐year birds and adults, and held 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> constant at 0 for first‐year birds. Mean annual nest success at Kigigak Island was included as a covariate because in years of low nest success, failed nesting females left the study area mid‐breeding season and hence were difficult to resight. We did not model 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> as a function of tag type (tarsal vs. nasal) because this was confounded with age and year, and individual birds often had both types of tags within their lifetime.
