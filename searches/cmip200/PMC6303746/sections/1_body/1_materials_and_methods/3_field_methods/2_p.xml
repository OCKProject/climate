<p class="p">For this study, we focused on female Spectacled Eiders, which show strong site fidelity to breeding areas. On Kigigak Island, distances between old and new nests were within 2.2 km (Moran, 
 <xref rid="ece34637-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>). Therefore, we made the assumption that there was no permanent emigration by females from the study area. The core nesting area for Spectacled Eiders on the Y‐K Delta was defined based on medium to high densities of nesting birds detected during aerial surveys from 1988 to 1994. Kigigak Island falls within this core nesting area, and approximately 70% of the island was searched for Spectacled Eider nests each year. Nesting habitat consisted primarily of high graminoid and intermediate sedge meadow (Grand et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34637-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1998</xref>). Incubating female Spectacled Eiders were located by searching variable numbers of 412 × 412 m plots each May and June from 1992 to 2015. A sample of adult females were captured using manually triggered bow‐nets or mist‐nets. All capture activities were conducted 1–4 days prior to expected hatch to minimize the chance of nest abandonment. Expected hatch date was examined using float angles of three eggs per nest (Westerkov, 
 <xref rid="ece34637-bib-0066" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1950</xref>). Upon capture, adult Spectacled Eider females were marked with U.S. Geological Survey metal tarsal bands and numbered yellow plastic tarsal bands or nasal discs (Lokemon &amp; Sharp, 
 <xref rid="ece34637-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1985</xref>). Nasal discs were introduced to facilitate resighting of marked birds, therefore, nasal‐tagged birds may have had higher resighting probabilities than those without. However, concerted efforts were made to view the legs of all birds encountered to maximize the probability of tag identification. Previously, banded females were identified visually using scopes and binoculars and were only recaptured if marks were unreadable. Field crews searched for broods over a 5‐day period in mid‐July. Ducklings were captured and banded with both metal and plastic bands at approximately 25–35 days of age.
