  <sub class="sub">D</sub>

 <italic class="italic">σ
  <sub class="sub">D</sub>
 </italic> increases, only models with projections that are extremely similar to observed values receive any weight. As 
 <italic class="italic">σ
  <sub class="sub">s</sub>
 </italic> increases, increasingly distant models are considered to be similar, and as 
 <italic class="italic">σ
  <sub class="sub">s</sub>
 </italic>→∞, the weighting scheme begins to have no effect. To balance over‐ and under‐weighting models, we calculated 
 <italic class="italic">σ
  <sub class="sub">D</sub>
 </italic> as the mean root‐square distance between models and observed data (passive microwave satellite imagery for the core wintering area), and 
 <italic class="italic">σ
