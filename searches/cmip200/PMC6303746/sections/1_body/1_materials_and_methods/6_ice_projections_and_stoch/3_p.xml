<p class="p">We projected future population size of female Spectacled Eiders on Kigigak Island using stochastic matrix population models (Caswell,

 <xref rid="ece34637-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>). We used a pre‐breeding census that included three age classes: juveniles, second‐year birds, and after second‐year birds. Breeding propensity, mean nest success, fecundity, and chick survival at Kigigak Island were obtained from Fischer, Williams, &amp; Stehn,

 <xref rid="ece34637-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>, and fertilities were calculated as the product of these vital rates and juvenile survival. Survival probabilities were estimated for each year between 2016 and 2100 using the ice threshold model described above and GCM sea ice projections. For each of 1,000 iterations, we drew a random number from a beta distribution of survival probabilities using the survival estimate and associated variance at each projected time step. Fertilities were drawn from a stretched beta distribution using the mean and variance based on historical observations at Kigigak Island. We used a starting population size of 127 female Spectacled Eiders (Flint et al.,
