<p class="p">Given the non‐linear effect of sea ice on survival, the issue becomes how to predict survival in both high and low sea ice years such that the estimated effect in a minimal ice year is not an artifact of extrapolation of an extreme ice effect. There is a clear negative correlation in the number of extreme and minimal ice days when viewed across years. To calculate survival of Spectacled Eiders based on projected future ice conditions, we first estimated the effects of observed extreme and minimal sea ice conditions on eider survival separately. We estimated the relationship between eider survival and the number of model simulated days per year with ice concentrations &gt;95% that had an effect on eider survival. To do this, we used QAICc to select among models with different thresholds of sea ice days from 20 to 100 extreme ice days per year (representing observed conditions). Years that met this threshold had a covariate value for number of extreme ice days, and years that did not meet this threshold had the covariate value set at 0. Similarly, for minimal sea ice conditions, we used QAICc to select the model with the appropriate threshold of minimal sea ice days from 40 to 110 days per year with sea ice concentrations &lt;15%. Years that met this threshold had a covariate value for number of days with low ice concentrations, and years that did not meet this threshold had the covariate value set at 0. Thus, extreme and minimal ice days became pseudo‐dummy variables in that no year would have a positive covariate value for both. Using this method, we were able to create a single model that estimated the relationship between survival and each end of the spectrum of ice concentrations. We then used parameter estimates from this model to estimate survival under projected future sea ice conditions.</p>
