<p class="p">From 1992 to 2015, we obtained encounter histories for 1,328 birds, of which 649 were initially captured as ducklings. We observed slight overdispersion in the data, and ĉ was estimated at 1.326. For detection probability, the model that received the most support allowed detection to vary by year and age, and the relative likelihood of this model compared to other models was 1.0 (Table
