<p class="p">Stochastic population projections demonstrated that under RCP 4.5, population size increased to 1,728 ± 428 (
 <italic class="italic">SD</italic>) females in 2069 coincident with moderate ice conditions early and mid‐century (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34637-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). However, as conditions on the Bering Sea became increasingly ice‐free toward the end of the century, the Kigigak population began to decline. It should be noted that there was a large amount of variation in stochastic projections for RCP 4.5 due to the combination of rapid population growth mid‐century and high uncertainty around parameter estimates for survival under future sea ice conditions. For RCP 8.5 projections, eider population size increased to a mean of 553 ± 74 females in 2041 and decreased to a mean of 2 ± 1 females in 2100 (Figure
