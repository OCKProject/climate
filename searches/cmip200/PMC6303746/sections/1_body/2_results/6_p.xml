<p class="p">The survival analysis in MARK indicated that survival declined when there were more than 80 extreme ice days per year or when there were more than 100 minimal ice days per year (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34637-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). The negative relationship was stronger for extreme ice days (

 <sub class="sub">minimal</sub> = −0.178, 95% CI = −0.364, 0.007). However, caution must be used in interpreting projected survival rates because 95% confidence intervals around the parameter estimate for minimal ice days slightly overlapped zero. Using this relationship to project survival rates, we found that survival under moderate sea ice conditions (when threshold for extreme ice and minimal ice days were not met) was relatively high at 0.88. These conditions were projected to occur early in the century, prior to 2049 for RCP 4.5, and prior to 2040 for RCP 8.5 (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34637-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). For the last half of the century, mean survival decreased to 0.84 for RCP 4.5 and 0.76 for RCP 8.5 in 2100.
