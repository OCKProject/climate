<p class="p">All eight GCMs projected steadily increasing numbers of ice‚Äêfree days toward the end of the 21st century, increasing more quickly for RCP 8.5 than RCP 4.5 (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34637-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). For RCP 8.5, the Spectacled Eider wintering area was projected to have over 100 minimal ice days by 2040 and be virtually ice free (175 out of 181 winter days without significant ice) by 2100 according to weighted estimates (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34637-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). For RCP 4.5, the eider wintering area was projected to have at least 100 minimal ice days by the end of the century. This compares with a mean of 56 minimal ice days per year during our study period in the core wintering area.
