<p class="p">To test whether the ice covariates explained a significant amount of variation in survival, we conducted an Analysis of Deviance (ANODEV). The quadratic term for extreme ice days explained 44% of total deviance based on ANODEV test results (

 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.005, Table

 <italic class="italic">F</italic> = 1.20, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.47). Parameter estimates from our model indicated that survival increased with number of extreme ice days until approximately 52 days, beyond which survival flattened out and then began to decrease at approximately 80 days (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34637-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>a). For comparison, we modeled survival as a function of minimal ice days (days with sea ice concentrations &lt;15%). Survival increased with minimal ice days until approximately 90 days, and then declined, although confidence intervals were wide, indicating considerable uncertainty (Figure
