<p class="p">The mechanisms for how eiders are affected by severe sea ice conditions are fairly well‐understood. Although Spectacled Eiders are adapted to harsh winter conditions, severe ice restricts access to benthic foraging grounds and can lead to high mortality rates and population declines (Flint et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34637-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>; Petersen &amp; Douglas, 
 <xref rid="ece34637-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>). It is possible that eiders moved out of the core wintering area in years of dense sea ice. However, eiders are thought to cease foraging and subsist on reserves rather than move to more distant areas, similar to other duck species (Lovvorn, 
 <xref rid="ece34637-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1994</xref>; Suter &amp; Van Eerden, 
 <xref rid="ece34637-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1992</xref>). This assumption is supported by observations of dense aggregations of Spectacled Eiders in the core wintering grounds in years when extremely high ice concentrations prevented them from accessing preferred foraging areas (Lovvorn et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34637-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). These dense flocks that occur in open leads are unlikely to deplete food resources due to the constant movement of the ice, which provides access to new food resources over the course of the winter (McDonald, Feder, &amp; Hoberg, 
 <xref rid="ece34637-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1981</xref>; Stoker, 
 <xref rid="ece34637-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1981</xref>). It is possible that eiders were able to forage in small leads in the ice during times when ice cover was greater than 95%. Unfortunately, our sea ice data were not high enough resolution to detect these fine‐scale openings and small leads in the ice. Despite this limitation, and the dynamic nature of sea ice, our models indicated a decline in survival in years with heavy sea ice, even when measured at the 25‐km scale.
