<p class="p">Climate change has the potential to impact Spectacled Eider winter ecology through changes in both sea ice concentrations and prey species composition. This paper examines the former, but changing prey densities in the Bering Sea may be equally, if not more important. It has been hypothesized that the concentration of wintering Spectacled Eiders in the St. Lawrence Island polynya is a result of abundant prey taxa (bivalves) and prey size (12–30 mm) relative to other locations in the Arctic (Grebmeier et al.,

 <xref rid="ece34637-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref> found that interannual variability in sea ice in the Bering Sea is correlated with changes in benthic ecosystem structure and invertebrate species composition. Multiple consecutive years of low sea ice in the Bering Sea could conceivably lead to a major ecosystem shift from marine communities dominated by high densities of benthic macro‐invertebrates toward communities dominated by demersal fish and predatory invertebrates (Grebmeier et al.,
