<p class="p">Our models showed a great deal of uncertainty associated with the relationship between survival and minimal sea ice conditions. Therefore, we recommend that additional years of survival data will be necessary to test our hypothesis that low sea ice conditions negatively impact survival. This uncertainty is in large part due to our time series of observations not containing many years of minimal sea ice; only one year fell above the 100‐day threshold for minimal ice conditions, whereas 7 years fell above the 80‐day threshold for extreme ice conditions. In recent history, Spectacled Eider populations were probably limited primarily by dense ice pack rather than low sea ice cover on the Bering Sea. Additional data on eider survival in low‐ice years will decrease uncertainty about this relationship. We also acknowledge the uncertainty associated with projecting survival in response to future sea ice conditions that are expected to be lower than previously observed. Projections of wildlife responses to future environmental conditions are challenging due to the complexity of natural systems and the omission of important drivers like biotic interactions (Allen, Stott, Mitchell, Schnur, &amp; Delworth,
