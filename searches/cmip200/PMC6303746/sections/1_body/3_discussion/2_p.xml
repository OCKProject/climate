<p class="p">This study showed that much of the variation observed in Spectacled Eider survival from 1993 to 2015 could be explained by sea ice conditions at the species’ wintering area in the Bering Sea. Survival was high in years with moderate sea ice, and decreased in winters with long periods of heavy sea ice and also in winters with very little sea ice. This tendency of vital rates to peak under moderate sea ice conditions has been observed in other sea ice‐associated birds such as Terre Adélie Emperor Penguins (
