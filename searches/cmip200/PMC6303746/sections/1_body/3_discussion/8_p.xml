<p class="p">Many species respond to climate change by shifting their ranges (Chen, Hill, Ohlemüller, Roy, &amp; Thomas,

 <xref rid="ece34637-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>). If a species must respond to changing climatic conditions but is unable to shift its distribution due to barriers to migration, the inability to move, or the absence of alternative habitat, then populations are likely to go extinct (Beever et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34637-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>; Durance &amp; Ormerod, 
 <xref rid="ece34637-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>; Sinervo et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34637-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). Spectacled Eiders shifted their core molting areas up to 90 km over two decades (Sexson et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34637-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>), and could conceivably shift their wintering area in a similar manner. The establishment of a new wintering area further north would require (a) the behavioral plasticity to make such a shift, and (b) suitable prey densities in a location with optimal ice conditions to support the population.
