<p class="p">Spectacled Eiders experienced sharp population declines in western Alaska from the 1950s to 1990s, prompting their listing as “threatened” under the Endangered Species Act in 1993 (USFWS, 
 <xref rid="ece34637-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1993</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ece34637-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). Suspected causes for declines include exposure to lead shot on the breeding grounds, high predation rates, hunting pressure, and inhospitable sea ice conditions in the wintering area (Flint, Grand, &amp; Petersen, 
 <xref rid="ece34637-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>; Flint, Grand, Morse, &amp; Fondell, 
 <xref rid="ece34637-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>; Grand, Flint, Petersen, &amp; Moran, 
 <xref rid="ece34637-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1998</xref>). Spectacled Eiders are closely associated with sea ice during winter (Petersen et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34637-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1999</xref>), which provides a platform for them to rest on between foraging bouts and dampens wave action, reducing the costs of thermoregulation (Lovvorn, Grebmeier, Cooper, Bump, &amp; Richman, 
 <xref rid="ece34637-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). Extremely high sea ice concentrations, however, restrict access to preferred benthic foraging grounds (Lovvorn et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34637-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) and years with long periods of extensive sea ice have been associated with low survival (Flint et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34637-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). During periods of nearly continuous sea ice, eiders do not appear to disperse to other areas, and have been observed in very dense flocks (up to 10,000 birds) concentrated in small patches of open water (Petersen et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34637-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1999</xref>).
