<p class="p">Climate change‐induced distributional shifts and extirpations have been documented for many animal taxonomic groups (Beever, Brussard, &amp; Berger, 
 <xref rid="ece34637-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>; Parmesan &amp; Yohe, 
 <xref rid="ece34637-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>; Pounds et al.,

 <xref rid="ece34637-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1999</xref>). The mechanisms causing these responses involve altered survival and reproduction as a result of changing environmental conditions (Croxall, Trathan, &amp; Murphy, 
 <xref rid="ece34637-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>; Post &amp; Forchhammer, 
 <xref rid="ece34637-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>; Saether et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34637-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>). Predicting the response of populations to climate change is difficult, not only because it is challenging to predict the actual degree of environmental change, but also because the relationships between vital rates and environmental factors are often not known. To complicate matters, different vital rates such as reproduction and survival can respond in opposite directions to climate change (van de Pol et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34637-bib-0064" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>), and species can have non‐linear responses to changing conditions (Ballerini, Tavecchia, Olmastroni, Pezzo, &amp; Focardi, 
 <xref rid="ece34637-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>; Stenseth &amp; Mysterud,
