<p class="p">The Spectacled Eider (
 <italic class="italic">Somateria fischeri</italic>) is a diving sea duck that forages on bivalve mollusks in the benthic zone in Arctic waters (Petersen, Piatt, &amp; Trust,

Geographically distinct breeding populations occur in eastern Siberia, northern Alaska, and western Alaska; however, all three populations converge in a small wintering area south of St. Lawrence Island in the Bering Sea (Petersen, Larned, &amp; Douglas,

 <xref rid="ece34637-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). The area southwest of St. Lawrence Island is known to be a benthic hotspot with high microfaunal benthic biomass, the most abundant taxa being bivalves and polychaetes (Grebmeier et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34637-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). The bivalve species sampled in this region are thought to be the preferred size for Spectacled Eiders (12–30 mm), causing the St. Lawrence Island Polynya to stand out among other benthic hotspots in the Arctic in providing optimal foraging conditions for Spectacled Eiders (Grebmeier et al.,
