<p class="p">In this study, we analyzed 23 years of mark‐recapture data from Spectacled Eiders banded on their breeding grounds in Western Alaska, and assessed whether variation in survival could be explained by sea ice and weather conditions in the Bering Sea wintering area. A negative relationship between Spectacled Eider survival and years with high sea ice concentrations was documented by Flint et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34637-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref> for the period 1992–2004. We were interested in repeating this analysis using a longer time series, and also testing for non‐linear relationships with sea ice, temperature, wind, and global atmospheric patterns. Subsequent to the survival analysis, we used an ensemble of Global Circulation Model (GCM) projections to estimate future sea ice conditions in the wintering area, and used those projections to model future Spectacled Eider population size under two different greenhouse gas emissions scenarios.
