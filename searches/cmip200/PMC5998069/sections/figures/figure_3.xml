  <p class="p">Correlation between the zonal component of vertically integrated moisture flux averaged over the region of 60E–120E and 70N–80N (the black longitude-latitude box in the previous figure) and −SIE09hp in observation (black line) and CESM-LE (bars and gray lines) for each month. The bars represent ensemble mean, while the vertical gray lines show the spread of one standard deviation from the ensemble members. Hatches denote ensemble-mean values significantly different from zero at 0.05 level by the two-sided Student’s t-test.</p>
