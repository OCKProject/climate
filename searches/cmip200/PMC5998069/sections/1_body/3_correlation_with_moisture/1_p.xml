<p id="Par10" class="p">Next, we calculate the correlation coefficient between the moisture transport in each individual month and −SIE09hp to test the hypothesis that anomalously high spring moisture transport into the Arctic will lead to a low Arctic sea ice extent in September. Here, we define the index of moisture transport as the zonal component of vertically integrated moisture flux averaged over the region of 60E–120E and 70N–80N (the black longitude-latitude box in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). The choice of this index as well as the regional box has multiple reasons. First, the zonal moisture transport is part of the cyclonic (spring) and anticyclonic (summer) patterns of moisture transport over the Arctic and thus more or less representative of the overall moisture transport. Second, it has opposite signs between spring and summer both in reanalysis and CESM-LE, which reflects the opposite patterns of moisture transport between the two seasons. Third, the index is highly correlated to the moisture transport through the Laptev Sea area, where the September sea ice concentration typically shows the strongest anomalies

 </sup>. The fact that this choice leads to more consistent behavior with respect to surface fluxes as will be seen later further strengthens this point to some degree.
