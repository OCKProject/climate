 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> shows the correlation between the index and −SIE09hp in reanalysis (black line) and CESM-LE (bars and gray lines) as a function of calendar month. The leading feature from the observations is the contrast between spring and summer: while the moisture transport index is positively correlated with −SIE09hp, the correlation coefficient becomes negative in summer. The same feature can also be seen in the CESM-LE ensemble mean with positive and negative correlation coefficients in spring and summer, respectively, although the peak value month is April in reanalysis and May in CESM-LE. While the ensemble mean values are consistent with observations in spring and summer, there is indeed a large spread from the 40 ensemble members as indicated by the gray vertical lines in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>. For example, while the ensemble mean value has the maximum value in May, results from individual ensemble members can also be negative in the same month. Also, in August, when the ensemble mean is most negative, individual ensemble members can still have positive values, implying that moisture transport appears to have a modulating rather than a controlling role.
