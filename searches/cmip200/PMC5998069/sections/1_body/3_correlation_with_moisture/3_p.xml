<p id="Par12" class="p">We also examined the index of the zonal mean of meridional moisture transport at 70N (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S8</xref>), which represents the moisture convergence into the Arctic, and has a similar correlation coefficient with −SIE09hp as the index used in our study, especially for CESM-LE. However, there are indeed some important differences: while the index used in the current study has the highest correlation coefficient with −SIE09hp in April (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>), the correlation peaks in March and May for the moisture convergence index in observation and is close to zero in April (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S8</xref>). Our physically motivated box index shows the largest correlations with −SIE09hp in April, at the same time when the regressed surface heat fluxes averaged over the Arctic north of 70N are at a local maximum (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>).
