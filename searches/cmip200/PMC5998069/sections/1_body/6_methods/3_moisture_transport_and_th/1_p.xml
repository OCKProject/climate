<p id="Par18" class="p">The term of moisture transport used in this study refers to the vertically integrated moisture flux and is a horizontal vector field. The moisture transport index used in the correlation analysis is defined as the zonal component of the moisture transport averaged over the region of 60E–120E and 70N–80N (the longitude-latitude box in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>), which is more correlated with surface heat fluxes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>) than the moisture convergence into the Arctic (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S8</xref>).
