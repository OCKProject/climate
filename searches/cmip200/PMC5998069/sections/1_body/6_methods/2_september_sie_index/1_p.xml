<p id="Par17" class="p">Sea ice extent (SIE) is defined as the total area covered by grid points that have the sea ice concentration (SIC) greater than 15%. In this study, our focus is on the September SIE over the Northern Hemisphere (north of 30N). In order to isolate the year-to-year variability of September SIE from the long-term trend, we apply a second-order forward-backward Butterworth high-pass filter with a cutoff period of 9 years. The resulting SIE time series, SIE09hp (“09” and “hp” denote September and high-pass, respectively), is then used in the linear regression analysis to reveal the relationship between the September SIE and other meteorological fields on the interannual time scale. In order to relate other fields directly with the September sea ice loss, the actual time series of September SIE used in the regression analysis is its negative, or −SIE09hp.</p>
