<p id="Par16" class="p">We use the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Interim (ERA-Interim) reanalysis
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>
 </sup> for monthly atmospheric circulation, vertically integrated moisture transport and surface heat fluxes. For the surface heat fluxes, we first calculate the daily means from the 12-hour forecasts and then calculate the monthly means. To compare the results with an earlier period, we also use the ERA-20C reanalysis
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>
 </sup>, which is ECMWF’s atmospheric reanalysis of the 20th century (1900–2010) that assimilates observations of surface pressure and surface marine winds only. For observed sea ice concentration, we use version 1 of Gridded Monthly Sea Ice Extent and Concentration
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">19</xref>
 </sup> as the primary data set, and version 2 of NOAA/NSIDC Climate Data Record of Passive Microwave Sea Ice Concentration

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">20</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">21</xref>
 </sup> for comparison. We also use the observational sea ice motion data set from version 3 of Polar Pathfinder Daily 25 km EASE-Grid Sea Ice Motion Vectors
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>
 </sup>. For model outputs, we analyze 40 ensemble members of the Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble (CESM-LE) Project
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>
 </sup>. Each ensemble member of CESM-LE is a fully-coupled simulation with slightly different atmospheric initial conditions that is integrated from 1920 to 2100. These simulations are forced by historical forcing during 1920–2005 and RCP8.5 radiative forcing (or a scenario of comparatively high greenhouse gas emissions) thereafter. Our analysis is mainly focused on the period 1979–2013 to compare with satellite observations of SIE. Therefore, the CESM-LE simulations analyzed in this study include historical simulations over the years 1979–2005 plus RCP8.5 projections over the year 2006–2013. For a comparison, we also analyze outputs from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5)
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">23</xref>
 </sup>, for which we use 30 different models and pick one single simulation for each model (Table
