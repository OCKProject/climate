 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref> shows the Northern Hemisphere September SIE anomalies from observations and 40 ensemble members of CESM-LE. A declining trend since the late 1970s is apparent in both observations and CESM-LE, with a decrease of 2–3 million square kilometers during the period of 1979–2013. In addition to the long-term trend we can see large year-to-year fluctuations, and the amplitude in observations is comparable to that in CESM-LE. To focus on this interannual variability, we apply a high-pass filter to all the raw time series of September SIE with a cutoff period of 9 years. The resulting time series, named SIE09hp henceforth (“09” and “hp” denote September and high-pass, respectively), is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b</xref>, in black for observations and in grey for the ensemble members. The CESM-LE time series also show a ~2 million square kilometer range of fluctuations, similar in magnitude to the multi-decade declining trend. Comparing results from observations to those from CESM-LE, it is clear that the observed SIE is in general within the range of internal variability as indicated by the spread of the 40 ensemble members from CESM-LE. Therefore, simulations from CESM-LE reproduce the key characteristics of the Northern Hemisphere SIE interannual variability.
