<p id="Par14" class="p">In the summer season, sea ice albedo feedback is a dominant mechanism, since the regressed downward shortwave radiation has negative values but the net shortwave radiation has large positive values. This can only be achieved by greatly reduced shortwave radiation reflected back upward at the surface, which is realized through the sea ice albedo feedback. This is consistent with the argument in previous studies

 </sup> that moisture transport initiates the sea ice melt in spring, and sea ice albedo feedback amplifies the melt in summer. The regressed latent plus sensible heat fluxes are generally weak in spring and summer, but become strong in September and peak in October. This is a result of the delayed response in the atmosphere to sea-ice loss as the surface and overlying lower atmosphere are close to thermodynamic equilibrium in summer, but that is not the case in fall and the effect is greater in October than in September
