 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> shows different components of the surface heat flux regressed onto the −SIE09hp for the Arctic region north of 70N (The spatial patterns in observations and CESM-LE are shown in Figs 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S9</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S10</xref>, respectively). The downward longwave radiation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4a</xref>) is in general positive both in observations and CESM-LE, including in the spring season. There is an opposite effect on the shortwave radiation

 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4b</xref>. It is consistent with the hypothesis that spring moisture transport into the Arctic can induce anomalous downward longwave radiation at the surface that initiates the sea ice melt.
