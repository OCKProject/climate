<p id="Par2" class="p">Arctic Amplification (AA) is one of the most dramatic climate trends taking place over recent decades, as the mean surface temperature (especially in winter) has warmed twice as fast as the rest of the Earth

 </sup>. At the same time, the Arctic area covered by sea ice, or the Arctic sea ice extent (SIE), has also declined rapidly

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>
 </sup>, especially in September when the SIE reaches its annual minimum (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Besides AA and the rapid Arctic SIE decline, there is also substantial year-to-year variability of SIE superimposed on the long-term trend

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>
 </sup>. Yet, this interannual variability has received substantially less attention than the long-term trend.
