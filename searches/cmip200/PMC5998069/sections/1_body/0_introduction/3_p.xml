<p id="Par4" class="p">It is still unclear if the relationship between moisture transport into the Arctic and SIC revealed in observations can be reproduced in Global Climate Model (GCM) simulations. The observations also do not allow for analysis of the uncertainty in the relationship between moisture transport and SIE due to internal variability since the observed climate is just one representation in a range of possible climate states. We will address these issues in the current study. Specifically, we examine the correlation between the Northern Hemisphere September SIE and moisture transport into the Arctic in the preceding spring and summer seasons by analyzing model output from 40 ensemble members of the Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble (CESM-LE) Project

 </sup>. We compare the results from CESM-LE to observations and also examine the uncertainty of the relationship by examining the spread of the results from the 40 ensemble members.
