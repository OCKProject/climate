<p id="Par8" class="p">The relationships between September Arctic SIE and the atmospheric circulation in spring and summer revealed in observations can be reproduced not only in the ensemble mean of different simulations from a single model (CESM-LE) but also in those of 30 different models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) (Figs 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>). For example, the spring low pressure pattern centered around the Barents-Kara Seas and the summer high pressure pattern over the Arctic are both reproduced well in the CMIP5 multi-model ensemble means (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>). Therefore, the general agreement between observations and model simulations regarding the relationship between spring and summer sea-level pressure and the September SIE is not restricted to one single model (CESM) but is robust for a large number of different climate models.
