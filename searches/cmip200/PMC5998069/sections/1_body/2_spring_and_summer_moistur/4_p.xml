<p id="Par9" class="p">The regressed patterns shown above are not sensitive to which observational data sets are used (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>), and even not sensitive to which period is used for regression for CESM-LE (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4c,d</xref>). However, in ERA-20C reanalysis, the regressed patterns are significantly different before and after 1980 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4a,b</xref>). This is primarily due to great uncertainty in the sea ice concentration estimates in the pre-satellite era. By looking at the regressed patterns in each individual month, we find that the spring SLP patterns are dominated by March and April both in reanalysis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S5</xref>) and CESM-LE (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S6</xref>) In summer, observed moisture transport is much stronger in August than June but the CESM-LE values have a similar magnitude in all the three months. Finally, regressed patterns from sea-ice fields are generally consistent with the circulation patterns shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S7</xref>).
