<p id="Par7" class="p">In summer, there is an anomalous high over the high Arctic both in reanalysis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b</xref>) and CESM-LE (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2d</xref>). Consequently, a clockwise moisture transport is seen around the anomalous high. As a result, the zonal direction of the moisture transport over the region of 60E–120E and 70N–80N (the black longitude-latitude box in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>) is opposite to that in the spring season.
