<p id="Par6" class="p">To reveal the spatial patterns of atmospheric fields associated with low September SIE on the interannual time scale, we conduct a linear regression analysis of these fields on the negative of the time series SIE09hp, or −SIE09hp. The regressed sea-level pressure and moisture transport are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>, showing the results both in spring (March–May, MAM) and summer (June–August, JJA), and both from ERA-Interim reanalysis (henceforth, reanalysis) and CESM-LE. In spring, a low pressure pattern is centered around the Barents-Kara Seas in observations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref>). Consistent with the low pressure pattern, moisture is transported into the Arctic through the Kara-Laptev Sea pathway and returned southward through the Greenland Sea longitudes. The low pressure pattern is also seen in CESM-LE (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2c</xref>), but it is located to the west of the observed one, between the Greenland and Barents Seas. Due to the westward shift of the low pressure center in CESM-LE, the moisture transport into the Arctic is now through the Barents and Kara Seas. A weak moisture transport back southward along the the Greenland Sea is also seen in CESM-LE, although the magnitude is smaller than in observations.
