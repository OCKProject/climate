<p id="Par15" class="p">It has been hypothesized that spring moisture transport into the Arctic can initiate sea ice melt and lead to below-normal SIE in September, when the Arctic SIE reaches its minimum of the year. The moisture transport could therefore be an important driver that can help explain the year-to-year fluctuations of the Arctic SIE minimum. Here we test this hypothesis using CESM-LE consisting of 40 identically forced simulations during the period 1979â€“2013. We find that low September SIE is linked to enhanced spring moisture transport into the Arctic and an anomalous downward thermal radiation at the surface in both observations and CESM-LE, which is consistent with the proposed hypothesis. Furthermore, we also see an anomalous moisture transport out of the Arctic in summer, which is associated with the anticyclonic atmospheric flow pattern centered around the North Pole. In contrast to our findings for spring, the ice albedo feedback is likely the dominant process that reduces sea ice in summer. The correlation between moisture transport and September SIE has opposite signs in spring and summer both in observations and the CESM-LE ensemble mean, due to different moisture transport directions in the two seasons. However, the correlation shows large internal variability as revealed by the spread of the results for individual ensemble members of CESM-LE, implying that moisture transport plays a modulating rather than a controlling role and other processes like sea ice export variability also have to be considered.</p>
