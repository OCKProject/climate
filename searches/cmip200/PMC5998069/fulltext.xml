Yet large year-to-year fluctuations are also present in the September SIE and the mechanisms for this variability are still not clear. Here we address this issue by examining the preconditions in meteorological fields in the previous spring and summer from observations and a large ensemble of historical climate model simulations. The focus of this study is on the impact of anomalous moisture transport into the Arctic and the associated surface energy fluxes on the September SIE. We find that the below-normal September SIE is associated with enhanced moisture transport into the Arctic in spring, which induces downward thermal radiation at the surface. However, in summer, the anomalous moisture transport over the Arctic is divergent due to an anticyclonic atmospheric flow pattern and the ice albedo feedback plays a leading role in sea ice loss.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Arctic Amplification (AA) is one of the most dramatic climate trends taking place over recent decades, as the mean surface temperature (especially in winter) has warmed twice as fast as the rest of the Earth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.

Therefore, it has been hypothesized that anomalously high moisture transport into the Arctic in spring, which is usually accompanied by both intense surface winds and a burst of high moisture content and warming within the Arctic atmospheric column, will lead to a decreased Arctic SIE in September<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Indeed, recent observational studies show that in years when there is low sea ice concentration (SIC) in summer and autumn, there is increased moisture transport into the Arctic in the preceding spring<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">It is still unclear if the relationship between moisture transport into the Arctic and SIC revealed in observations can be reproduced in Global Climate Model (GCM) simulations. The observations also do not allow for analysis of the uncertainty in the relationship between moisture transport and SIE due to internal variability since the observed climate is just one representation in a range of possible climate states. We will address these issues in the current study. Specifically, we examine the correlation between the Northern Hemisphere September SIE and moisture transport into the Arctic in the preceding spring and summer seasons by analyzing model output from 40 ensemble members of the Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble (CESM-LE) Project<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. We compare the results from CESM-LE to observations and also examine the uncertainty of the relationship by examining the spread of the results from the 40 ensemble members.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Northern Hemisphere September SIE</title><p id="Par5">Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref> shows the Northern Hemisphere September SIE anomalies from observations and 40 ensemble members of CESM-LE. A declining trend since the late 1970s is apparent in both observations and CESM-LE, with a decrease of 2&#x02013;3 million square kilometers during the period of 1979&#x02013;2013. In addition to the long-term trend we can see large year-to-year fluctuations, and the amplitude in observations is comparable to that in CESM-LE. To focus on this interannual variability, we apply a high-pass filter to all the raw time series of September SIE with a cutoff period of 9 years. The resulting time series, named SIE09hp henceforth (&#x0201c;09&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;hp&#x0201d; denote September and high-pass, respectively), is shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>, in black for observations and in grey for the ensemble members. The CESM-LE time series also show a ~2 million square kilometer range of fluctuations, similar in magnitude to the multi-decade declining trend. Comparing results from observations to those from CESM-LE, it is clear that the observed SIE is in general within the range of internal variability as indicated by the spread of the 40 ensemble members from CESM-LE. Therefore, simulations from CESM-LE reproduce the key characteristics of the Northern Hemisphere SIE interannual variability.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Spring and Summer Moisture Transport and Circulation</title><p id="Par6">To reveal the spatial patterns of atmospheric fields associated with low September SIE on the interannual time scale, we conduct a linear regression analysis of these fields on the negative of the time series SIE09hp, or &#x02212;SIE09hp. The regressed sea-level pressure and moisture transport are shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, showing the results both in spring (March&#x02013;May, MAM) and summer (June&#x02013;August, JJA), and both from ERA-Interim reanalysis (henceforth, reanalysis) and CESM-LE. In spring, a low pressure pattern is centered around the Barents-Kara Seas in observations (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). Consistent with the low pressure pattern, moisture is transported into the Arctic through the Kara-Laptev Sea pathway and returned southward through the Greenland Sea longitudes. The low pressure pattern is also seen in CESM-LE (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>), but it is located to the west of the observed one, between the Greenland and Barents Seas. Due to the westward shift of the low pressure center in CESM-LE, the moisture transport into the Arctic is now through the Barents and Kara Seas. A weak moisture transport back southward along the the Greenland Sea is also seen in CESM-LE, although the magnitude is smaller than in observations.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Seasonal-mean sea-level pressure (shadings) and moisture transport (vertically integrated moisture flux, vectors) associated with negative anomalies of high-pass-filtered Northern Hemisphere sea-ice extent in September (SIE09hp) as estimated from linear regression.

Consequently, a clockwise moisture transport is seen around the anomalous high. As a result, the zonal direction of the moisture transport over the region of 60E&#x02013;120E and 70N&#x02013;80N (the black longitude-latitude box in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) is opposite to that in the spring season.</p><p id="Par8">The relationships between September Arctic SIE and the atmospheric circulation in spring and summer revealed in observations can be reproduced not only in the ensemble mean of different simulations from a single model (CESM-LE) but also in those of 30 different models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) (Figs&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>).

Therefore, the general agreement between observations and model simulations regarding the relationship between spring and summer sea-level pressure and the September SIE is not restricted to one single model (CESM) but is robust for a large number of different climate models.</p><p id="Par9">The regressed patterns shown above are not sensitive to which observational data sets are used (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>), and even not sensitive to which period is used for regression for CESM-LE (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4c,d</xref>). However, in ERA-20C reanalysis, the regressed patterns are significantly different before and after 1980 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4a,b</xref>). This is primarily due to great uncertainty in the sea ice concentration estimates in the pre-satellite era. By looking at the regressed patterns in each individual month, we find that the spring SLP patterns are dominated by March and April both in reanalysis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref>) and CESM-LE (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6</xref>) In summer, observed moisture transport is much stronger in August than June but the CESM-LE values have a similar magnitude in all the three months. Finally, regressed patterns from sea-ice fields are generally consistent with the circulation patterns shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S7</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Correlation with Moisture Transport</title><p id="Par10">Next, we calculate the correlation coefficient between the moisture transport in each individual month and &#x02212;SIE09hp to test the hypothesis that anomalously high spring moisture transport into the Arctic will lead to a low Arctic sea ice extent in September. Here, we define the index of moisture transport as the zonal component of vertically integrated moisture flux averaged over the region of 60E&#x02013;120E and 70N&#x02013;80N (the black longitude-latitude box in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The choice of this index as well as the regional box has multiple reasons. First, the zonal moisture transport is part of the cyclonic (spring) and anticyclonic (summer) patterns of moisture transport over the Arctic and thus more or less representative of the overall moisture transport. Second, it has opposite signs between spring and summer both in reanalysis and CESM-LE, which reflects the opposite patterns of moisture transport between the two seasons. Third, the index is highly correlated to the moisture transport through the Laptev Sea area, where the September sea ice concentration typically shows the strongest anomalies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. The fact that this choice leads to more consistent behavior with respect to surface fluxes as will be seen later further strengthens this point to some degree.</p><p id="Par11">Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> shows the correlation between the index and &#x02212;SIE09hp in reanalysis (black line) and CESM-LE (bars and gray lines) as a function of calendar month. The leading feature from the observations is the contrast between spring and summer: while the moisture transport index is positively correlated with &#x02212;SIE09hp, the correlation coefficient becomes negative in summer. The same feature can also be seen in the CESM-LE ensemble mean with positive and negative correlation coefficients in spring and summer, respectively, although the peak value month is April in reanalysis and May in CESM-LE. While the ensemble mean values are consistent with observations in spring and summer, there is indeed a large spread from the 40 ensemble members as indicated by the gray vertical lines in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. For example, while the ensemble mean value has the maximum value in May, results from individual ensemble members can also be negative in the same month. Also, in August, when the ensemble mean is most negative, individual ensemble members can still have positive values, implying that moisture transport appears to have a modulating rather than a controlling role.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Correlation between the zonal component of vertically integrated moisture flux averaged over the region of 60E&#x02013;120E and 70N&#x02013;80N (the black longitude-latitude box in the previous figure) and &#x02212;SIE09hp in observation (black line) and CESM-LE (bars and gray lines) for each month.

Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> shows different components of the surface heat flux regressed onto the &#x02212;SIE09hp for the Arctic region north of 70N (The spatial patterns in observations and CESM-LE are shown in Figs&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S9</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S10</xref>, respectively). The downward longwave radiation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>) is in general positive both in observations and CESM-LE, including in the spring season.

This is consistent with the argument in previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> that moisture transport initiates the sea ice melt in spring, and sea ice albedo feedback amplifies the melt in summer. The regressed latent plus sensible heat fluxes are generally weak in spring and summer, but become strong in September and peak in October. This is a result of the delayed response in the atmosphere to sea-ice loss as the surface and overlying lower atmosphere are close to thermodynamic equilibrium in summer, but that is not the case in fall and the effect is greater in October than in September<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par15">It has been hypothesized that spring moisture transport into the Arctic can initiate sea ice melt and lead to below-normal SIE in September, when the Arctic SIE reaches its minimum of the year. The moisture transport could therefore be an important driver that can help explain the year-to-year fluctuations of the Arctic SIE minimum. Here we test this hypothesis using CESM-LE consisting of 40 identically forced simulations during the period 1979&#x02013;2013. We find that low September SIE is linked to enhanced spring moisture transport into the Arctic and an anomalous downward thermal radiation at the surface in both observations and CESM-LE, which is consistent with the proposed hypothesis. Furthermore, we also see an anomalous moisture transport out of the Arctic in summer, which is associated with the anticyclonic atmospheric flow pattern centered around the North Pole. In contrast to our findings for spring, the ice albedo feedback is likely the dominant process that reduces sea ice in summer. The correlation between moisture transport and September SIE has opposite signs in spring and summer both in observations and the CESM-LE ensemble mean, due to different moisture transport directions in the two seasons. However, the correlation shows large internal variability as revealed by the spread of the results for individual ensemble members of CESM-LE, implying that moisture transport plays a modulating rather than a controlling role and other processes like sea ice export variability also have to be considered.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Data</title><p id="Par16">We use the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Interim (ERA-Interim) reanalysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> for monthly atmospheric circulation, vertically integrated moisture transport and surface heat fluxes.
