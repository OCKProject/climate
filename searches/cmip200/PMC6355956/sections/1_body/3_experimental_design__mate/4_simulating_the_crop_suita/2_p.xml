<p id="p0055" class="p">The suitability rasters for the major crops were globally modelled on a per pixel basis using the EcoCrop model for the current baseline and future climatic scenarios (separately for the three GCMs under RCP8.5 emission scenario) based on the combination of temperature and precipitation parameters choosing minimum of scores as the aggregation procedure. The EcoCrop model as programmed in Terrset software is used to model the suitability of the selected crops. EcoCrop uses the set environmental ranges specific for each crop as an input. These factors are the minimum and maximum temperatures, optimum minimum and maximum temperatures, kill temperatures, minimum precipitation, optimum minimum and maximum precipitation, and crop growing season length (days). In addition, the model uses monthly precipitation and monthly minimum and mean temperatures for the period of interest as inputs to determine the central niche of the studied crop. The model then generates a suitability index for each crop as an output. A detailed description of EcoCrop is found in 
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[5]</xref>. The EcoCrop is a mechanistic model. When the precipitation and temperature values exceeds their absolute threshold, the model will give a suitability score of zero. On the contrary, if these values are within the optimum and absolute thresholds, the model will give a suitability score ranging from 0 to 1. Using FAO crop ecological database, two sets of crop suitability maps for the basins were generated, one for current conditions and another set for the future conditions. Each set of maps is composed of nineteen maps (one map for each crop). To automate the process of clipping to the study area, a GIS model was formulated to automate the clipping process of all the suitability rasters to the boundary of the study area (

 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref> shows a sample wheat suitability map for current and future conditions for four basins of the study area. Data shows that in the croplands of the Levant, suitability of crops such as wheat, grapes, apples, apricots, and many vegetable crops will decrease by 10â€“50%, with variability among basins and countries. While only subtle changes in the suitability of crops in the Nile Basin were noticed (on a spatial average), suitability will change spatially. Crop suitability will increase in the middle of the Nile and decreasing in the upper parts of the basin. Wheat, barley and vegetables are the most crops susceptible to changes in crop suitability in the Nile.
