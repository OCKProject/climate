<p id="p0045" class="p">The global meteorological data provided by WorldClim were downloaded and used as inputs for the crop suitability analysis for the current (baseline, representative of 1970–2000) and future (2050, representative of 2041–2060) climatic conditions. For the future climate (average of 2041–2060) data sets, we used the average climate data from three general circulation models (GCMs): CCSM4, GFDL-CM3, and HadGEM2-ES, where they are based on the Representative Concentration Pathway RCP8.5, the highest emission scenario, from the CMIP5
