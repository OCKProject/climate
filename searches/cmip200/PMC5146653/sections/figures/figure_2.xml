  <title class="title">Rate of change of volume accumulated in salinity coordinates.</title>
  <p class="p">Rate of change of volume accumulated in salinity coordinates from low salinity to high salinity (Sv), equivalent to a transformation rate. Salinity anomaly is defined with respect to global mean salinity. Positive values represent an accumulation of less saline water (transformation from saline to fresh water) and negative values represent an accumulation of more saline water (transformation from fresh to saline water). Shown are the three observational datasets (over 1950–2010) and the ten CMIP5 historical simulations (over 1950–2005) (Colours: as in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>). Positive transformation rates mainly occur in the fresh regions and negative transformation rates mainly occur in the saline regions.
