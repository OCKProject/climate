   <bold class="bold">a</bold>) Calculated water cycle change versus inferred water cycle change using 
   <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eq3" class="xref">equation (1)</xref> based on changes in the mean salinity deviation. Horizontal dashed lines show the water cycle change inferred from the three observational estimates. Grey shaded area depicts one standard deviation limits for En4. Also shown is the line of best fit (black line; slope 90%; r = 0.92; p &lt; 0.01). (
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>) Change in water cycle as a percentage of historical mean versus change in global mean surface temperature. Also shown are lines of best fit (black; slope 4.2%/°C; r = 0.87; p &lt; 0.01) and of CC rate (red; 7%/°C). Squares show historical, circles show RCP4.5, and diamonds show RCP8.5 simulations (colours correspond to models as in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>). Black square with uncertainty range depicts the mean from the three observational estimates.
