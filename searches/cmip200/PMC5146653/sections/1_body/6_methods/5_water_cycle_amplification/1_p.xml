<p class="p">Water cycle amplification rate (%) is defined as the water cycle amplitude change (inferred from 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eq3" class="xref">equation (1)</xref> for the observational estimates) divided by the climatological mean water cycle amplitude (i.e. from long-term mean distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">P−E+R</italic> in observations and historical CMIP5 simulations). We also express water cycle change as a water cycle sensitivity to global surface warming (%/°C; amplification (%) per degree of global mean surface temperature rise (/°C)) to compare our results with the CC relationship.
