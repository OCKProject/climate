<p class="p">If the global annual mean fresh water budget is balanced, the accumulated integral of 
 <italic class="italic">P+R−E</italic> in salinity space should sum to 0 at the end of integration. For the OAGP-Dai dataset a value of 0.45 ± 0.51 Sv is obtained indicative of a significant net freshening (

 <italic class="italic">P</italic> + 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>) while for CORE2-Dai a value of 0.05 ± 0.15 Sv is obtained showing again a net freshening but with a global fresh water budget closer to balanced. CMIP5 models considered here are very close to balanced at their pre-industrial state (not shown) whilst most of them show a small global net freshening over the historical period with the ensemble mean value being 0.11 ± 0.21 Sv.
