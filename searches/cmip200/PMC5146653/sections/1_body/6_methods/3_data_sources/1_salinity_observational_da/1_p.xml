<p class="p">The global salinity change over 1950–2010 is assessed using three observational datasets a) the UK Met Office Hadley Centre Enhanced Ocean Data Assimilation and Climate prediction (ENACT) archive version4 (En4, subversion En4.1.1, 1° x 1° grid) dataset (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" class="xref">21</xref>, b) the Ishii (Ishii, subversion v6.13, 1°x1° grid) dataset (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20" class="xref">20</xref>, and c) the CSIRO dataset (1° x 2° grid) (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11" class="xref">11</xref>. All three datasets consist of quality-controlled temperature and salinity (PSS-78) profiles spanning the period 1950–2010 with most of original data sources being common including the World Ocean Database (2005), the Global Temperature-Salinity Profile Programme (from 1990) and profiling float data from the Argo Global Data Assembly Center (from 1999). The datasets have significant differences in their trend analysis methodology. Unlike the En4 and Ishii datasets for which analysis is based on objectively-analyzed monthly fields, the CSIRO dataset uses a variable search radius, dependent on spatial and temporal sampling, which leads to highly-variable “spatial footprints” of mapped trends in the pre-Argo era so that broad-scale trends are appropriately emphasized. While in the En4 dataset trends are linearly fitted to the interpolated annual mean data provided by the objectively-analysed monthly fields
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" class="xref">12</xref>, in CSIRO dataset the salinity trends are fitted concurrently with the mean climatology and the ENSO signal through a multiple linear regression
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11" class="xref">11</xref>. Another difference between the datasets concerns their depth/area coverage. While the trend analysis in the En4 dataset involves the global ocean, in the Ishii (CSIRO) dataset only the upper 0–3000 m (0–2000 m) layer is considered. Moreover in the CSIRO dataset all marginal seas and regions north (south) of 70°N (°S) are excluded from the trend analysis. When we consider the same smaller area/depth coverage for En4 as for CSIRO dataset, we obtain slightly lower values for both the water cycle increase (~10%) and the global net freshening (~20%). On the other hand, all datasets have almost identical climatological mean volumetric distribution in salinity space when considering the common smaller area/depth coverage. Assuming changes in the deep ocean not too different in the three datasets, we are using the En4 deep ocean data to extrapolate the Ishii and CSIRO-derived values for the water cycle increase for the global ocean area/depth coverage.
