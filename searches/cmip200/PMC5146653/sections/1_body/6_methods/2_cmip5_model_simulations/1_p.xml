<p class="p">We analysed the output of the pre-industrial, historical, Representative Concentration Pathways 4.5 (RCP4.5) and 8.5 (RCP8.5) simulations from ten Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5)
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" class="xref">22</xref> models including ACCESS1.3, CMCC-CM, CNRM-CM5, GFDL-ESM2M, HadGEM2-ES, IPSL-CM5A-LR, MPI-ESM-MR, MRI-CGCM3, EC-EARTH, NorESM1-M. The model selection is based on the output availability of three variables: 3-D salinity, net surface fresh water flux (precipitation + river runoff + ice melting - evaporation - ice formation), and surface air temperature. From the NCAS British Atmospheric Data Centre
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27" class="xref">27</xref> we retrieved monthly 3-D salinity (so), monthly net surface fresh water flux (wfo), as well as monthly surface air temperature (tas) fields. The periods analysed include a 150-year period from the pre-industrial simulations, 1950–2005 from the historical simulations, and 2006–2100 from the RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 simulations. All models are tested in their pre-industrial control runs and they do not show any statistical significant trend in the width of their salinity volumetric distribution or in their water cycle.
