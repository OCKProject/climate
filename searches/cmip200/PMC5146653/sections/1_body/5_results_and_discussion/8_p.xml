<p class="p">Variations of the water cycle amplitude (

 </sub>) in CMIP5 show large inter-annual variability but also large, statistically significant (at the 95% confidence interval) positive linear trends over the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century in all RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 model runs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3a</xref>). In most models the water cycle increases close to linearly from the late 1970 s to the end of 21st century. Considering the CMIP5 ensemble means, the water cycle amplification rate (with respect to the pre-industrial mean) is estimated to be 2.4 ± 1.7% (4.0 ± 3.0%/°C) in the historical, 7.2 ± 2.4% (4.4 ± 1.5%/°C) in the RCP4.5, and 18.2 ± 4.5% (4.6 ± 1.3%/°C) in the RCP8.5 runs, respectively.
