<p class="p">All observational products show an amplification of the mean 3-dimensional salinity field over 1950–2010 (See 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). In general isohaline layers become thicker in both low-salinity and high-salinity regions, while thinning at salinities around the global mean, with the fresh Southern Ocean showing the larger isohaline volume increases. High and low salinity water is formed at the expense of salinity classes closer to the mean (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>). As the water cycle amplifies high-salinity waters are transformed into more saline waters in dry (evaporation-dominated) regions, and low-salinity waters are transformed into less saline waters in fresh (precipitation-dominated) regions. Fresh regions become fresher and saline regions become more saline consistent with the “wet gets wetter, dry gets drier” paradigm
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" class="xref">23</xref>. This suggests a freshwater displacement in salinity space, i.e. from high-salinity to low-salinity regions. There are substantial differences in the resulting change of the salinity volumetric distribution between CMIP5 models as well as between models and observations (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>). However, most models, in accordance with observations, show a significant stretching of the salinity distribution as the water cycle amplifies, with mostly positive freshwater transformation rates representing an accumulation of less saline water in the fresh regions (
