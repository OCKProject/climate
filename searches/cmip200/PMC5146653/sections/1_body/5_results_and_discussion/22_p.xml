<p class="p">Data sparsity certainly limits the applicability of this method over the earlier decades of the observational record. However this method is expected to become progressively more applicable as salinity sampling increases. The continuous acquisition of 3-D salinity data by the ARGO network since the early 2000â€‰s, achieving an unprecedented near-global ocean observation, will help us to progressively enhance the present knowledge of changing salinity and the water cycle.</p>
