<p class="p">An actual input of extra fresh water is plausible especially at high-latitudes due to glacial and sea-ice melt. An equivalent fresh water input due to the observed 2 mm/yr (3.2 mm/yr) global sea level rise over 1971–2010 (1993–2010; satellite data only) mainly attributed to glacier melt and thermal expansion amounts to 0.024 Sv (0.038 Sv)
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" class="xref">25</xref>. If we remove the estimated thermal expansion contribution to sea level rise for this period of 40% (34% for satellite only period)
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26" class="xref">26</xref> we obtain a value of ~0.015 Sv (0.023 Sv), which is of the same order of magnitude to that inferred from the net freshening of the EN4 and Ishii datasets.
