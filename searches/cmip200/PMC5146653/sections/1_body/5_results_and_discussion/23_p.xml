<p class="p">Despite the sources of uncertainty stated above, the water cycle amplification we estimate from salinity observations (3.0 ± 1.6% °C
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) is well within the spread of climate model projections (4.3 ± 2.0% °C
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>). This adds confidence to projections of global water cycle amplification substantially below the CC rate under anthropogenic greenhouse gas emission scenarios.
