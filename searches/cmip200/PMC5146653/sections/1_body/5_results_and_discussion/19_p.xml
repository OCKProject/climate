<p class="p">CMIP5 outputs have been used here to test (not calibrate) the mixing parameterization of our method, and, in particular, to confirm that in physically consistent representations of the global ocean, mixing effects which control the mean salinity distribution also control its response to forcing changes. There may be an asymmetry between the mixing effects which set the mean state and those which arise in response to transient climate change that is not captured in either our theory or any of the climate models considered, which is an important caveat of this work. There are large uncertainties due to different representations of processes, and different mixing parameterizations in particular, in the various CMIP5 models. This results in a quite large multimodel standard deviation for the inferred water cycle change from 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eq3" class="xref">equation (1)</xref> (~50% of the mean). However, although climate model simulations for the same period display a diverse range of solutions in terms of where salinity changes occur, they agree with observations, within the large uncertainties of each, in terms of their water cycle response to global warming.
