<p class="p">This stretching of the salinity distribution results in an increase in the mean deviation (
 <italic class="italic">W’;</italic> change in 
 <italic class="italic">W</italic> over time) of 0.0035 pss (En4), 0.0020 pss (Ishii), 0.0045 pss (CSIRO), and 0.0034 ± 0.0020 pss (CMIP5) over the historical period. The changes in 
 <italic class="italic">W</italic> observed are larger than the standard deviation of 
 <italic class="italic">W</italic> in En4 but are small (e.g. of the order of the precision of typical salinometers) since they combine order 0.5 pss changes in salinity near the surface with vanishingly small signals in the deep ocean (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). Estimates of 
 <italic class="italic">W ′</italic> are substantially larger when only the upper ocean is considered (e.g. 
 <italic class="italic">W</italic>′ = 0.015pss above 1000 m from En4 data and by which depth 80% of the signal in water cycle change signal is detected;
