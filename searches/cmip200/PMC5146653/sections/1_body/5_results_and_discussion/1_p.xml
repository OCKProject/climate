 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Figure 1a</xref> shows the historical mean volumetric distribution in salinity coordinates for the En4 observational dataset and the ten CMIP5 models considered here. Most CMIP5 models show a broader mean volumetric distribution than observations. The CMIP5 ensemble mean 
 <italic class="italic">W</italic> over the historical period (1950–2005) is 0.214 ± 0.032 pss (multimodel mean ± standard deviation, see Methods) as compared to 0.192 for En4. In contrast with the large multimodel spread in 
 <italic class="italic">W</italic> (~15% of the mean) 
 <italic class="italic">W</italic> mean uncertainty in CMIP5 (i.e. average of individual model standard deviations of the detrended yearly timeseries) is quite small (~0.0012) and comparable to the observational uncertainty (En4; ~0.0011). The global full-depth ocean salinity distribution changes very slowly since salinity variations in the deep ocean i.e. below 1000 m, representing the major part of the total ocean volume, are very small.
