 </sub> of 0.059 ± 0.022 Sv for En4, 0.032 ± 0.012 Sv for Ishii, and 0.068 ± 0.025 Sv for CSIRO between 1950 and 2010. Considering the climatological mean water cycle obtained from the re-analysis/observational data, these changes imply an amplification of the water cycle (i.e. defined as the water cycle change inferred from 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eq3" class="xref">equation (1)</xref> divided by the climatological mean water cycle amplitude) of 1.19 ± 0.46% for Ishii, 2.21 ± 0.85% for En4 and 2.54 ± 0.96% for CSIRO over 1950–2010.
