<p class="p">Using salinity observations we infer a water cycle amplification of 3.0 ± 1.6%/°C, which is approximately half the CC rate. A lower increase in the water cycle than the CC rate has been attributed to a weakening of the atmospheric circulation due to warming, leading to a partial compensation for the water cycle increase (e.g., Held and Soden

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4" class="xref">4</xref> (~8 ± 5%/°C). Our approach differs from Durack 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>.
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4" class="xref">4</xref> in that it is based on a salt conservation law, linking water cycle change to ocean salinity rather than an empirical relationship. In addition, our method exploits the full 3-D salinity observations. Differences between observed and modelled surface salinity changes as highlighted by Durack 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>.
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4" class="xref">4</xref> may, for example, reflect biases in the way models simulate the ventilation of surface signals into the ocean interior
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" class="xref">25</xref>. Another important difference is that our analysis distinguishes between water cycle change (i.e. associated with the increase in the salinity contrast between water masses) and global net fresh water input (

However the ensemble mean of net freshening (0.11 ± 0.21 Sv) is small and not statistically significant. When the net freshening is not accounted for in (1;
