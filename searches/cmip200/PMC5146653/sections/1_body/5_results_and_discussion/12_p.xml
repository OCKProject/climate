 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4a</xref>). This shows a robust linear relationship between the calculated and inferred water cycle change (R = 0.92, statistically significant at the 99% confidence interval). The slope of the one-to-one line is indistinguishable from the line of best fit in terms of correlation suggesting there is no consistent bias in the method. Standard deviation of inferred values with respect to the one-to-one line is ~22% of the mean change. This provides an estimate of the uncertainty of our method (i.e. using parameterized
