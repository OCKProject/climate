As the water cycle amplifies, the width of the salinity distribution increases and the salinity contrast between water masses becomes larger, resulting in an increasing diffusive salt flux that damps the growth in width of the salinity distribution. Considering the CMIP5 ensemble mean for the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 runs (1950â€“2100), the progressive increase in salt mixing over that period reduces the net stretching of the salinity distribution (i.e. driven by the water cycle increase) by approximately 60% at the end of 21
