 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Figure 4b</xref> shows the change in water cycle amplitude versus the global-mean surface air temperature change for the ten CMIP5 models in their historical (1950–2005), RCP4.5 (2006–2100), and RCP8.5 (2006–2100) runs. Results indicate a robust relationship between increasing water cycle amplitude and surface warming. The linear trend (R~0.87, statistically significant at the 99% confidence interval) gives a water cycle amplitude sensitivity to warming of 4.3 ± 2.0%/°C for CMIP5, which is much less than that predicted by the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship (~7%
