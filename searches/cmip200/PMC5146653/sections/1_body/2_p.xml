<p class="p">A number of previous studies have inferred long-term increases in the water cycle from observed changes in the 3-D salinity field

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" class="xref">12</xref>. However, uncertainty in estimating global water cycle change was quite large in all these studies as calculations were based on rather strong assumptions such as zero salt fluxes between the mixed layer and the deeper ocean
