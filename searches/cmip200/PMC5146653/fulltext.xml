As air warms, its capacity to hold water increases at the Clausius-Clapeyron rate (CC, approximately 7%&#x02009;&#x000b0;C<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>). Surface ocean salinity observations have suggested the water cycle has amplified at close to CC following recent global warming, a result that was found to be at odds with state-of the art climate models. Here we employ a method based on water mass transformation theory for inferring changes in the water cycle from changes in three-dimensional salinity. Using full depth salinity observations we infer a water cycle amplification of 3.0&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.6%&#x02009;&#x000b0;C<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> over 1950&#x02013;2010.

In general isohaline layers become thicker in both low-salinity and high-salinity regions, while thinning at salinities around the global mean, with the fresh Southern Ocean showing the larger isohaline volume increases. High and low salinity water is formed at the expense of salinity classes closer to the mean (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). As the water cycle amplifies high-salinity waters are transformed into more saline waters in dry (evaporation-dominated) regions, and low-salinity waters are transformed into less saline waters in fresh (precipitation-dominated) regions. Fresh regions become fresher and saline regions become more saline consistent with the &#x0201c;wet gets wetter, dry gets drier&#x0201d; paradigm<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. This suggests a freshwater displacement in salinity space, i.e. from high-salinity to low-salinity regions. There are substantial differences in the resulting change of the salinity volumetric distribution between CMIP5 models as well as between models and observations (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). However, most models, in accordance with observations, show a significant stretching of the salinity distribution as the water cycle amplifies, with mostly positive freshwater transformation rates representing an accumulation of less saline water in the fresh regions (<inline-formula id="d32e419"><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="d32e420" xlink:href="srep38752-m7.jpg"/></inline-formula>) and mostly negative transformation rates representing an accumulation of more saline water in the saline regions (<inline-formula id="d32e423"><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="d32e424" xlink:href="srep38752-m8.jpg"/></inline-formula>).</p><p>This stretching of the salinity distribution results in an increase in the mean deviation (<italic>W&#x02019;;</italic> change in <italic>W</italic> over time) of 0.0035 pss (En4), 0.0020 pss (Ishii), 0.0045 pss (CSIRO), and 0.0034&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.0020 pss (CMIP5) over the historical period.

It is interesting to note that in climate models total <italic>P</italic> is increasing at a significantly lower rates (~3.4%/&#x000b0;C, Allen and Ingram<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>; ~2%/&#x000b0;C, Held and Soden<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>; 3.1%/&#x000b0;C, Durack <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> - than the global E-P pattern (~4.5%/&#x000b0;C, Durack <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). Although precipitation extremes are shown to follow CC scaling, the total global average precipitation, commonly referred to as the strength of the water cycle in climate sciences, is constrained by the atmospheric radiative energy balance (e.g. Allen and Ingram<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, Held and Soden<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). A change in the water cycle well below the CC rate was exhibited by the majority of coupled climate models (Allen and Ingram<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>; Held and Soden<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>; Durack <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>).</p><p>Using salinity observations we infer a water cycle amplification of 3.0&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.6%/&#x000b0;C, which is approximately half the CC rate. A lower increase in the water cycle than the CC rate has been attributed to a weakening of the atmospheric circulation due to warming, leading to a partial compensation for the water cycle increase (e.g., Held and Soden<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). Our observational salinity-based estimate of water cycle change is substantially smaller than that reported by Durack <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> (~8&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5%/&#x000b0;C). Our approach differs from Durack <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> in that it is based on a salt conservation law, linking water cycle change to ocean salinity rather than an empirical relationship. In addition, our method exploits the full 3-D salinity observations. Differences between observed and modelled surface salinity changes as highlighted by Durack <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> may, for example, reflect biases in the way models simulate the ventilation of surface signals into the ocean interior<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. Another important difference is that our analysis distinguishes between water cycle change (i.e. associated with the increase in the salinity contrast between water masses) and global net fresh water input (<italic>F</italic><sub><italic>melt</italic></sub>). All datasets show a large global net freshening amounting to ~0.044&#x02009;Sv for CSIRO, ~0.025&#x02009;Sv for Ishii and ~0.029&#x02009;Sv for En4 that is of the same order of magnitude with the water cycle increase (i.e. ~50&#x02013;80% of <italic>F</italic><sub><italic>cycle</italic></sub>&#x02019;). If the <italic>F</italic><sub><italic>melt</italic></sub> term is not included in the calculation we infer much larger water cycle changes of 0.048&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.019&#x02009;Sv for Ishii, 0.073&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.028&#x02009;Sv for En4, and 0.097&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.037&#x02009;Sv for CSIRO. This effect alone would bring the CSIRO estimate of water cycle change up to ~5.5&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.3%&#x02009;&#x000b0;C<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. Although CMIP5 models do not have interactive ice sheets some models do show net freshening due to small unbalances in their freshwater budget. However the ensemble mean of net freshening (0.11&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.21&#x02009;Sv) is small and not statistically significant. When the net freshening is not accounted for in (1; <italic>F</italic><sub><italic>melt</italic></sub> &#x02009;=&#x02009;0) the correlation and slope between the calculated water cycle change and that inferred using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eq3">equation (1)</xref> reduces to 0.86 (from 0.92) and 83% (from 90%), respectively. The attribution by Durack <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> of all surface salinity contrast change to the water cycle, rather than in part to a net addition of freshwater, may help explain the large water cycle change they infer.</p><p>The global net freshening estimated by the three observational products could be due to a real physical change or a general bias in the observational analysis. A source of bias could be the ill-conditioning of salinity trends due to the lack of observations over earlier decades and in the Southern Hemisphere and deep layers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>.</p><p>An actual input of extra fresh water is plausible especially at high-latitudes due to glacial and sea-ice melt. An equivalent fresh water input due to the observed 2&#x02009;mm/yr (3.2&#x02009;mm/yr) global sea level rise over 1971&#x02013;2010 (1993&#x02013;2010; satellite data only) mainly attributed to glacier melt and thermal expansion amounts to 0.024&#x02009;Sv (0.038&#x02009;Sv)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. If we remove the estimated thermal expansion contribution to sea level rise for this period of 40% (34% for satellite only period)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> we obtain a value of ~0.015&#x02009;Sv (0.023&#x02009;Sv), which is of the same order of magnitude to that inferred from the net freshening of the EN4 and Ishii datasets.</p><p>CMIP5 outputs have been used here to test (not calibrate) the mixing parameterization of our method, and, in particular, to confirm that in physically consistent representations of the global ocean, mixing effects which control the mean salinity distribution also control its response to forcing changes. There may be an asymmetry between the mixing effects which set the mean state and those which arise in response to transient climate change that is not captured in either our theory or any of the climate models considered, which is an important caveat of this work. There are large uncertainties due to different representations of processes, and different mixing parameterizations in particular, in the various CMIP5 models. This results in a quite large multimodel standard deviation for the inferred water cycle change from <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eq3">equation (1)</xref> (~50% of the mean). However, although climate model simulations for the same period display a diverse range of solutions in terms of where salinity changes occur, they agree with observations, within the large uncertainties of each, in terms of their water cycle response to global warming.</p><p>Another large source of uncertainty in our analysis is the spread in the water cycle amplification inferred from the three observational salinity datasets. Although these datasets are based on common <italic>in situ</italic> observations, they use different trend analysis methods and space/time interpolation techniques to deal with the large data gaps. Uncertainties of our observationally-based estimates are quite large (~40% of the mean) but generally lower than those of previously reported estimates of global water cycle change inferred from observed salinity change using different methods - i.e. Durack <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> infer 8&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5%/&#x000b0;C over 1950&#x02013;2000, while Skliris <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> infer 4.7&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.5%/&#x000b0;C over 1950&#x02013;2010.</p><p>Our estimates of the magnitude of water cycle change do not rely on the accuracy of CMIP5. However we do rely on CMIP5, in part, for our uncertainty estimates. If the relationship between the range of possible water cycle changes and the range of salinity distribution changes in CMIP5 were to be an underestimate (over-estimate) this would lead us to underestimate (overestimate) our water cycle change uncertainty. Our uncertainty estimate also relies on the range of salinity distribution change estimates from observations being representative of the range of possible actual changes. If the range of changes were under-estimated (over-estimated) by the observational network and the mapping techniques used to produce the three data sets, this would also lead to an underestimate (over-estimate) of the uncertainty. Although we cannot quantify how these factors contribute to the uncertainty it is our opinion that they are more likely to lead to larger than smaller uncertainties.</p><p>Data sparsity certainly limits the applicability of this method over the earlier decades of the observational record. However this method is expected to become progressively more applicable as salinity sampling increases. The continuous acquisition of 3-D salinity data by the ARGO network since the early 2000&#x02009;s, achieving an unprecedented near-global ocean observation, will help us to progressively enhance the present knowledge of changing salinity and the water cycle.</p><p>Despite the sources of uncertainty stated above, the water cycle amplification we estimate from salinity observations (3.0&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.6%&#x02009;&#x000b0;C<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) is well within the spread of climate model projections (4.3&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.0%&#x02009;&#x000b0;C<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>).

The datasets have significant differences in their trend analysis methodology. Unlike the En4 and Ishii datasets for which analysis is based on objectively-analyzed monthly fields, the CSIRO dataset uses a variable search radius, dependent on spatial and temporal sampling, which leads to highly-variable &#x0201c;spatial footprints&#x0201d; of mapped trends in the pre-Argo era so that broad-scale trends are appropriately emphasized. While in the En4 dataset trends are linearly fitted to the interpolated annual mean data provided by the objectively-analysed monthly fields<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, in CSIRO dataset the salinity trends are fitted concurrently with the mean climatology and the ENSO signal through a multiple linear regression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Another difference between the datasets concerns their depth/area coverage. While the trend analysis in the En4 dataset involves the global ocean, in the Ishii (CSIRO) dataset only the upper 0&#x02013;3000&#x02009;m (0&#x02013;2000&#x02009;m) layer is considered.

On the other hand, all datasets have almost identical climatological mean volumetric distribution in salinity space when considering the common smaller area/depth coverage.
