<p class="p">Climate model projections are the only available tools that can be used to quantitatively assess potential long-term changes in sea-ice biogeochemical dynamics in a warmer Arctic. Here, we use a near-mechanistic modeling approach that combines sea-ice drivers obtained from an ensemble of 18 CMIP5 [Climate Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (

This is motivated by the inherent constraints of climate projections and by the sparse availability of recurring studies on seasonal sea-ice biogeochemistry. We seek to elucidate the first-order impacts of large-scale, climate-driven ice changes on sea-ice algal production rather than considering the more local and subregional components, e.g., as done in (
