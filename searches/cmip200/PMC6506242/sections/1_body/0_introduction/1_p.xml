Before the onset of the seasonal phytoplankton bloom, sea ice provides critical habitat for marine algae and the upper trophic levels for whom sea-ice algae are their sole food-source during this period. Together with sub-ice phytoplankton, sea-ice algae represent the foundation of ecological interactions in the sea-ice biome (

  <italic class="italic">2</italic>
 </xref>). Algal growth in sea ice is limited by the strong seasonality of light, nutrients, and brine connectivity and, in first-year ice, by the relatively narrow time window during which sea ice exists. At high latitudes, light conditions in the sea-ice habitat are subject to extreme seasonal changes. Light availability is largely regulated by the photoperiod, which depends on latitude and time of the year, and by the albedo and light attenuation of different sea-ice surfaces (e.g., snow-covered ice, bare ice, and ponded ice). Nutrients in sea ice are replenished through brine connectivity with the underlying water column and through local regeneration processes. Brine connectivity depends on brine permeability, a function of both sea-ice temperature and salinity. The warmer and less salty the ice, the greater its permeability and thus its habitable space.
