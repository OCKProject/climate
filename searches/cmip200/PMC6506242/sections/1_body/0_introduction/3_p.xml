 <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">20</italic>
 </xref>). The strongest trend since 1979 has occurred in the Barents Sea and East Greenland Sea (25 and 30 days, respectively), while less rapid trend is observed in the Baffin Bay, Kara Sea, and Hudson Bay (22, 15, and 10 days, respectively), and the weakest trend is found in the Central Arctic Sea (5 days). There is increasing consensus that these advances in melt onset, together with thinner sea ice and increased stratification, have led to conditions generally more favorable for sub-ice pelagic blooms in the last 30 years (
 <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">21</italic>
 </xref>), suggesting that the advancement of the phytoplankton bloom peak has made the annual season of primary productivity overall longer as well (
