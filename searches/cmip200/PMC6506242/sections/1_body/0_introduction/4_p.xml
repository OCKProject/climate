<p class="p">However, less is known of the conditions that lead to sea-ice algal blooms, which are also dependent on other factors such as brine connectivity. Changes in sea-ice nutrient concentrations are expected to affect the overall amplitude (

These phenological cascades are expected to be stronger in the Arctic Ocean where there is tight coupling between abiotic conditions and the timing of primary production and where the food chains are short (
