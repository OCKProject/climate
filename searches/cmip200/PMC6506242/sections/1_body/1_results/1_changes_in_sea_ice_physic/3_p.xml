<p class="p">At all latitudes (
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>), the projected physical drivers of sea ice trend toward thinner sea ice (approximately from 0.3 m thinner in the low latitudes to 1.3 m thinner at high latitudes), warmer near-surface minimum atmospheric temperature (up to 15°C warmer above 70°N), later freeze-ups (average, 1.5 months), earlier breakups (average, 1 month), thinner snow depth (0.05 to 0.15 m), and generally shorter ice seasons. The variation of the freeze-up medians is larger in the future scenario, highlighting the intermodel variance in simulated summer sea-ice losses over the 21st century (
