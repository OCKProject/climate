<p class="p">We used the ensemble means in 
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref> to construct representative pan-Arctic sea-ice seasons at 2Â° latitudinal resolution for both time slices in the form of continuous forcing functions (see Materials and Methods for details). The physical forcings were then used to drive the sea-ice biogeochemical model, simulating the permeability and biogeochemistry of the dynamic bottom permeable sea-ice layer and the development of environmental factors for sea-ice algal growth (

  <italic class="italic">24</italic>
 </xref>). The biogeochemical model simulated the sympagic system, focusing on one class of sea-ice algae resembling Arctic pennate diatoms, which are the dominant community in bottom sea ice (
 <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">39</italic>
 </xref>) and are characterized by efficient light acclimation while limited by nutrients found in the bottom permeable layer (see Materials and Methods for details). While the initial composition of the sympagic community can be highly heterogeneous [e.g., (
 <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">40</italic>
 </xref>)], mirroring that of the ocean underneath, the blooming phase is usually dominated by pennate diatom species after natural selection of the most adapted taxa to survive and grow when suitable environmental conditions return [e.g., (
