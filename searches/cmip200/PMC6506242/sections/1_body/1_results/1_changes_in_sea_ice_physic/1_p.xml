<p class="p">Daily and monthly simulations of physical properties of sea ice were used to derive empirical probability density functions of sea-ice drivers in latitudinal bands of 2°, based on 18 CMIP5 climate models (table S1) for recent historical (1961–2005) and business-as-usual representative concentration pathways [RCP8.5, 2061–2100 (

 </xref>)] scenarios (see Materials and Methods for details). This method is superior to the use of zonal averages when dealing with variable events such as the day of freeze-up and breakup of sea ice, and it has been successfully used in climate model analyses (

 </xref>). It also allows us to derive statistical descriptors of the extremes of the distribution, without any assumption on the shape of the distribution itself. Models were selected according to the availability of high-frequency daily data at the time of analysis. Sea-ice drivers considered were date of freeze-up, date of breakup, maximum sea-ice thickness, first-year ice extent, first month of snow cover, last month of snow cover, maximum snow depth, and minimum near-surface atmospheric temperature, as well as the dates at which the maxima and minima occurred. The climate data were obtained from the same CMIP5 dataset used in earlier works on future Arctic changes under the RCP8.5 scenario [e.g., (

 </xref>)]. However, here, we considered minimum air temperature rather than mean air temperature, focused on first-year ice only rather than on all Arctic sea ice, and explored daily data of sea-ice drivers rather than monthly averages, providing an original contribution to the analysis of CMIP5 model outputs.
