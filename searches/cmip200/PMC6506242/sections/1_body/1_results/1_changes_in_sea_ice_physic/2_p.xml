<p class="p">We initially verified the ensemble means of first-year ice freeze-up and breakup days and the area extent for the period 1979–2005 from the 18 single distributions against remote sensing data (

 </xref>). The sea-ice drivers of phenology (freeze-ups and breakups) from the climate model ensemble distributions compare well with the distributions computed from the satellite data (
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>). In particular, the simulated medians of the days of freeze-up and breakup match the observations at all latitudes [root mean square differences (RMSDs) are 4 and 11 days, respectively]. The spread of the modeled distribution with respect to observations is similar for the freeze-up (
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 1A</xref>) but narrower for the modeled breakup, indicating less variability in CMIP5 models (
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 1B</xref>). Less agreement is found when comparing the medians of observed and modeled sea-ice extent (RMSD = 0.2 × 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>; 
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 1C</xref>), likely because of the known biases of CMIP5 models to simulate this sea-ice driver (

  <italic class="italic">33</italic>
 </xref>, 
 <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">34</italic>
 </xref>). The difference is particularly large in the latitudinal band between 70°N and 78°N. Our statistical approach demonstrates acceptable performances of the climate models, especially in terms of making the sea-ice drivers of phenology usable for the analysis of changes in seasonal sea-ice and their impact on ice algal phenology. The larger spread in sea-ice extent will instead be taken into consideration and discussed when integrating our latitudinal-based results on a pan-Arctic scale.
