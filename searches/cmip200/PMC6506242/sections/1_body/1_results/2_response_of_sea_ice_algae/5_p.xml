<p class="p">The first cluster (
 <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>, 61Â°N) is typical of regions such as the Bering Sea, the Sea of Okhotsk, the Hudson Bay, or the land-fast ice conditions found in Greenland fjords (

 <xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">42</italic>
 </xref>). According to our modeling results, below the Arctic Circle, sea ice is projected to become much thinner and entirely permeable. The thinner snow depth, expected to be less than 0.1 m, leads to a long productive season, with a large and sharp asymmetrical bloom that is characteristic of little light limitation (see also fig. S1C).
