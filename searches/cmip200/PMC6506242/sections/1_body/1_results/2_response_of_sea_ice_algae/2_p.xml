<p class="p">Despite similar latitudinal advances in projected breakup dates, the changes in timing of sea-ice algal blooms are different and grouped into two main clusters. Below 66°N, where the breakup date is projected to occur about 25 days earlier in the future climate (
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 2B</xref>), the bloom peak develops between 45 and 70 days earlier than in the historical climate (
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 3A</xref>). Above 66°N, the advance of the algal bloom is more in line with the advancing of the breakup dates (
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 2B</xref>), i.e., between 15 and 40 days earlier in the future projections (
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 3A</xref>). The number of clusters increases to three when we factor in the relative changes in GPP. For these clusters, low-latitude seasonal sea ice is expected to be up to 150% more productive (i.e., increasing from 0.48 to 1.20 g C m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> y
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> at 65°N). Smaller and negative variations are expected between 68°N and 74°N (i.e., between −25 and 11% relative change), while the largest increase is expected above 74°N, with up to more than 550% increase in GPP at 77°N (i.e., from 0.05 to 0.33 g C m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> y
