 </xref>), the Chukchi Sea, the Baffin Bay, and the Kara Sea, where sea-ice production under current climate conditions is limited by thick ice and snow despite the favorable photoperiod. The latitudes of up to 74°N are currently characterized by one of the largest extents of first-year ice (
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>), and these areas are projected to double by the end of the century (
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 2D</xref>). In the RCP8.5 scenario simulation at 71°N, both sea ice and snow are expected to thin largely, although not enough to allow sufficient growth within the narrower biological time window due to earlier breakups. The resulting magnitude of sea-ice production is expected to mimic current climate conditions, but the phenology is nonetheless altered toward earlier blooms (
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref> and fig. S1B).
