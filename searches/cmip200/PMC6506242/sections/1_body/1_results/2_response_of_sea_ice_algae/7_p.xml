<p class="p">The Barents Sea deserves specific mention because it is mostly located within this cluster’s range of latitudes, but it is characterized by sea-ice conditions more similar to that of the first cluster (
 <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>, 61°N). In the Barents Sea, we expect an increase in GPP similar to that seen at the lowest latitudes (
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 3A</xref>) because of significant sea ice and snow thinning (
 <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>, 61°N). However, we expect this to be modulated by the sharper photoperiod typical of these latitudes. This might reduce the length of the ice algal growing season in a way that is similar to the second cluster (
 <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>, 71°N).
