<p class="p">We searched for mechanisms linking the changes in physical drivers to the phenological differences illustrated in 
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>. We specifically investigated alterations in the timing of the peak bloom, driven by latitudinal variation in light availability. The available light in turn is a function of sea-ice and snow thicknesses, length of the biological time window, and photoperiod. We present here one latitude example for each cluster: 58°N to 66°N (lower panels), 66°N to 74°N (mid panels), and 74°N to 84°N (upper panels), representing respectively low-, mid-, and high-latitude pan-Arctic sea-ice ecosystems for historical (left) and RCP8.5 (right) scenario simulations (
