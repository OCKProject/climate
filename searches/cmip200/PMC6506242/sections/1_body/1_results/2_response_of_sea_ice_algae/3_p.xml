<p class="p">With inclusion of the projected latitudinal changes in ice extent (
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 2D</xref>), the relative increase in GPP per unit area predicted below 74°N diminishes because of the large loss of seasonal sea ice, while above 74°N, it becomes more important because of first-year ice largely expanding at the expense of multiyear ice (
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 3B</xref> and table S2). The combination of area-specific production increase and first-year ice expansion is expected to give rise to a sea-ice habitat that is more than 2500% more productive than in the recent climate for algae located northward of 80°N (i.e., from 7.48 to 199.48 Gg C y
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> at 83°N). Thus, the anticipated increase in first-year ice algal production would make this region productively equivalent to what is currently simulated 10° more to the south (table S2), which is a non-negligible change. In light of the CMIP5 model bias in sea-ice extent (particularly large between 70°N and 78°N; 
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 1C</xref>), we anticipate the relative increase in GPP found at these latitudes (
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 3B</xref>) to be even underestimated.
