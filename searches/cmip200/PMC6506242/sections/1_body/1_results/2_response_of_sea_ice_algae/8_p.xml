<p class="p">The third cluster (
 <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>, 81°N) is typical of first-year ice found in the high Arctic. An example of this cluster is the offshore Lincoln Sea north of Greenland. The area is currently characterized by first-year ice that is generally less productive than other shelf regions, with algal biomass comparable to multiyear ice conditions (

 </xref>). At these high latitudes, sea-ice blooms are limited by low brine permeability and thick ice and snow. The climate model projections indicate a marked thinning of the sea ice to levels similar to the current-day 71°N cluster (
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 2C</xref>). At these highest latitudes, the key factor responsible for the largest relative increase in GPP in first-year ice (
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>) is the advance of the sea-ice season toward a more favorable photoperiod, which would give rise to blooms that are expected to be larger than in the adjacent southern cluster (see also fig. S1A).
