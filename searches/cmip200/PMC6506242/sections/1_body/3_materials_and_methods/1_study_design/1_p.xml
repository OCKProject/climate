 </xref>) simulation were used as an example of a warming business-as-usual scenario. The models (listed in table S1) were selected according to the availability of daily data of sea-ice thickness and sea-ice concentration at the time of the analysis. We also did not exclude models based on performances because our method works on empirical probability density functions and not on zonal or monthly averages; therefore, we sought to preserve any possible interannual or regional variability that each model can elicit. In assessing the projections for an ice-free Arctic, Liu

 <xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">54</italic>
 </xref>) retained the models with the simulated September sea-ice extent falling within 20% of the observations. Twenty of the 30 models they examined satisfied that requirement, and 16 of the 18 models we considered are among these 20 [the additional two models we used were not available at the time of writing of Liu 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> (
 <xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">54</italic>
 </xref>)]. All original observations and model data grids were preserved, and stored daily data were used when available without any further spatial or temporal averaging. The observations of sea-ice concentration for current climate conditions (1979–2005) were obtained from Nimbus-7 SMMR and DMSP SSM/I-SSMIS passive microwave remote sensing data (
