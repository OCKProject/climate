<p class="p">The ensemble mean of the median values of the empirical probability density functions was used to construct an analytically idealized ice season (i.e., snow and sea-ice dynamics) for the historical and future climate at every band of latitudes as proposed by Tedesco and Vichi (

 </xref>). Sea-ice thickness was prescribed to grow with a cubic function from the first freezing event (i.e., below freezing temperature and the sea-ice thickness &gt;0.1 m) until the day when sea-ice thickness reached its seasonal maximum. This method takes into account the reduced growth due to sea-ice thickening and aging. After the seasonal maximum, sea ice was modeled to start melting with a cubic function. Snow was prescribed to accumulate linearly on sea ice from the first snow event (freezing temperature and snow depth of &gt;0 m) until its maximum and then to melt linearly until the last day of snow cover (snow depth of &gt;0 m). The surface temperature was modeled to decrease linearly from the freezing temperature to its minimum (dependent on latitude) and then to increase linearly until it reached the freezing point, which was then kept until all sea ice and snow were melted completely.
