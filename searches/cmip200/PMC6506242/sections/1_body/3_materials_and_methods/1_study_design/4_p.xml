<p class="p">The ensemble means of the 10th and 90th percentiles of the single model distributions were used to analyze the impact of extreme case scenarios (
 <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 6</xref>). It is physically inconsistent to combine the extreme drivers to create a scenario case where, for instance, the freeze-up occurs very early in the year, the snow depth is minimal, and the minimum air temperature is the lowest. The adopted solution consisted of selecting one model realization that represented the combination of the driver values in the tails of the distributions in a physically consistent manner. We selected the model with the shortest duration of the sea-ice season because all the other drivers were then generally located around or beyond the ensemble mean of the percentiles (
