 </xref>). Because of the lack of information from CMIP5 models on sea-ice halodynamics, we limited our investigation to the biological production of the bottom sea-ice habitable space, operationally defined as the sea-ice biologically active layer (BAL) (

 </xref>). This layer comprises the permeable part of sea ice that extends from the bottom-most sea ice upward until the brines volume reaches the 5% limit. The BAL fraction can be calculated given its boundaries. At the lower sea-ice interface with the ocean, seawater is assumed to be at freezing point, and brine volume is considered to be at 100%, i.e., all medium is liquid. At the upper interface, the BAL is delimited by the brines volume being 5% at the maximum. Given the computation of sea-ice bulk salinity after (

 </xref>), brine salinity and brine/sea-ice temperature were calculated from thermal equilibrium. Given the BAL sea-ice temperature, the dynamics of the BAL thickness were reconstructed with a cubic function, as done for sea-ice thickness. The computed physical variables needed by the ocean component of the biogeochemical model were seawater temperature, seawater salinity, wind speed, and PAR. The computed physical variables needed by the sea-ice component of the biogeochemical model were BAL thickness, temperature, bulk salinity, brine salinity, brine volume, and PAR.
