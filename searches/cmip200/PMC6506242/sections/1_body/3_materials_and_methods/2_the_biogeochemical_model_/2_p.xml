<p class="p">The biogeochemical prognostic variables presented are sea-ice algal Chl-a and GPP in the brine pockets and their vertical integral over the BAL, both temporally integrated over the duration of the sea-ice season. An indicator of phenology, the anomaly index of chlorophyll concentration in the brine volume has been developed (
