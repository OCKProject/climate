<p class="p">Sea ice is inhabited also by other algal groups besides the dominant pennate diatoms (

 </xref>). We thus may expect the potential development of new acclimation and/or adaptation patterns or the shift in dominance of other competitive algal groups in a warmer Arctic. The modeling of these ecological dynamics would require an increase in model complexity beyond that of the present study, which was constrained by the current limited knowledge on the ecological and physiological traits of other algal groups (

  <italic class="italic">39</italic>
 </xref>). To resolve the local features driving algal changes, we urgently need organized multidisciplinary studies of sea-ice physics, biogeochemistry, and associated biota on multiple temporal and spatial scales to achieve the proper level of details that models would need to make reliable future projections of algal phenological and trophic changes at those scales.
