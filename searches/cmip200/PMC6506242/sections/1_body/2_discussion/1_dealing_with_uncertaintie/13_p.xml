<p class="p">Since the Arctic marine food web is short, poorly diverse, and seasonally driven by limited pulses of energy, the projected latitudinal changes in ice algal phenology have the potential of trophic cascades and phenological shifts at higher trophic levels. The phenological synchrony across trophic levels is expected to be driven by the pace of advancing sea-ice breakups (

 </xref>) and consequent shift in algal bloom timing (this study). Thus, as supported by our results in 
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>, we might expect the strongest phenological cascades (i.e., shifts in timing) at the lowest latitudes where algal blooms are projected to occur significantly earlier, while the largest trophic cascades (i.e., changes in abundance at adjacent trophic levels) at the highest latitudes where the largest relative increase in biomass is projected.
