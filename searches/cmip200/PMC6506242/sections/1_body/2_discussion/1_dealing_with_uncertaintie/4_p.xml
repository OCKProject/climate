<p class="p">How can we incorporate the observational and climate model uncertainties in a more comprehensive overview of the potential impacts on the Arctic marine food web? The hybrid numerical model can also provide insights on the spread of algal response to a range of uncertain factors. We focused on the role of the unconstrained changes in future nutrient distributions (
