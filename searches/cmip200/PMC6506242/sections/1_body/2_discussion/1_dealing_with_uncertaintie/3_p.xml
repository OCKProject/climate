<p class="p">The anticipated phenological changes in GPP in a warmer Arctic indicate an overall early shift at all latitudes but large heterogeneity in the combination of bloom timing and intensity (
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>). These findings stress the nonlinearity of the response of the biological community to quasi-linear latitudinal changes in physical drivers, highlighting the complexity of the sympagic system. Important trade-offs are at play below 74Â°N; the expected increases in production are limited by the diminished seasonal areas, while blooms in areas with expanding first-year ice are limited by narrow growth windows. These are also the latitudes currently characterized by most of the coastal Arctic sea ice and where the terrestrial inputs of nutrients are most relevant.
