<p class="p">The use of 2Â° latitudinal bands, driven by the coarseness of climate model data, limits our ability to resolve the exact geographic boundaries of the sea-ice algal response. Our statistical methodology to include daily variability as a way to increase climate model skills in reproducing the seasonal patterns of sea-ice drivers cannot overcome the reduced regional variability, as indicated by the narrower spread of the model ensemble percentiles in 
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>. This can only be achieved with models at higher spatial resolution and more detailed sea-ice physical processes. We acknowledge the potential compromises that this approach presents with regard to ignoring variability in the local climatic conditions for the different sea-ice regions.
