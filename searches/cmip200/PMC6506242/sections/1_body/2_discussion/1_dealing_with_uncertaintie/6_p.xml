<p class="p">The presence of local upwelling and nutrient pulses generated by coastal features are likely to further enhance the productivity of the sea ice. South of the Arctic Circle, these events will be nevertheless confined to the strongly reduced areas of seasonal sea ice (

Given the wide spread of the tested nutrient concentrations, opposite speculations can be made, considering the projected enhancement in stratification that would result in lower or suppressed levels of nutrients (
