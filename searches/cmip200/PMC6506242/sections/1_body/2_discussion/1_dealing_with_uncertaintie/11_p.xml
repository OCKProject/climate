<p class="p">While the seasonal timing of the sea-ice algal bloom is critical to the successful reproduction of copepod grazers, the timing of the phytoplankton bloom is critical to the survival of copepod offspring (

 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figs. 2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6E</xref>) has already created mismatches for the timing of zooplankton production, which has consequences for higher trophic levels (

 </xref>). These copepods are highly adapted to feed on ice algae, and their overwintering survival is phenologically synchronized with the availability of this food source. We have shown here that earlier breakups, associated with altered photoperiods and thinner sea ice and snow, can shorten the length of the biological time window at mid-latitudes, thus setting an upper limit for ice algal production, which is not the case at low and high latitudes (
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figs. 3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). This might affect timing and amplitude of zooplankton production, which in turn might affect their main predator, Arctic cod, up to the top predators at the highest trophic levels. Because of the diverse latitudinal response of sea-ice algae (
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>) to changes in climatic drivers (
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>), we confirm the possibility of phenological uncoupling with secondary and tertiary consumers as described by Post (
