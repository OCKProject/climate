<p class="p">This response is sensitive to the snow depth simulated by climate models, as indicated in the scenario experiment where the snow-covered surface is forced with prescribed bare ice; the bloom would advance by at least 50 days at all latitudes (
 <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 6E</xref>, squares and fig. S3). We notice that the GPP of the high latitude clusters identified in 
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref> would be considerably larger (fig. S3). The smallest differences would be expected at the lowest latitudes, since there is a comparable decrease of maximum snow depth (&lt;0.1 m) in the RCP8.5 snow-covered scenario (
 <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>, 61°N, right panel). At the mid-latitudes, the little increase seen for the snow-covered RCP8.5 scenario (
 <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>, 71°N, right panel) would be replaced by a more intense increase because of the snow removal.
