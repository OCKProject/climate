<p class="p">It is known that the final algal biomass is also determined by winter nutrient availability in the ocean (

 <xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">44</italic>
 </xref>). The effects of this latitudinal variation of nutrients on sea-ice production have been tested with a sensitivity analysis to the 10th and 90th percentiles and comparison with the median value (
 <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref> and table S3), which was used in the presented standard simulations of 
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>. Overall, the different ranges of nutrients give values of sea-ice GPP and Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) falling within the reported ranges in the Arctic Ocean (tables S2 and S3) (
 <xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">45</italic>
 </xref>), although within their lower limits. This is due to the fact that our results are representative of wide latitudinal bands, thus flattening the influence of possible hot spots of biological production that can be found in the literature. Little nutrient variability is currently observed below 66°N, and this has a negligible effect on current and projected sea-ice GPP (
 <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>, 61°N; nutrient values are given in the legend). The largest observed nutrient heterogeneity is found between 66°N and 74°N (
 <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>, 71°N), which is an indication of the diversity of oceanic and coastal conditions at this latitudinal band. The simulated algal biomass is directly proportional to nutrient availability (
 <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">14</italic>
 </xref>, 
 <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">24</italic>
 </xref>), which is an expected response given that the vernal development of sea-ice algae occurs when all nutrient replenishing mechanisms are at their optimal conditions. Above 74°N, the observed spread in nutrient distribution is between the one found in two other cases and has an expected intermediate effect on the resulted GPP (
 <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>, 81°N).
