<p class="p">More extreme scenarios can be assessed by considering the ensemble means of the single model 10th and 90th percentiles, which are shown in 
 <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 6, A to D</xref> for a selected set of sea-ice drivers (see table S3 for a complete overview). Two extreme cases have been selected: a model realization characterized by the shortest sea-ice seasons along all latitudes (warm extreme; see Materials and Methods for details) and a drastic reduction to bare ice conditions (
 <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 6C</xref>). The latter case aims to analyze the impact that uncertainties associated with the modeled snow depth data (

 </xref>) may have on algal phenology and production. The results give a quantitative overview of the anticipated shifts in the algal bloom features as the projected sea-ice season shortens with the scenarios. While the bloom peak under current sea-ice conditions is evenly distributed across latitudes (
 <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 6E</xref>, circles), in the warm extreme case, it shows a rather linear response to shorter ice seasons (
 <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 6E</xref>, diamonds), as envisaged in conceptual models (

 </xref>, 
 <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">18</italic>
 </xref>). The higher latitudes will have more pronounced, earlier blooms as the ice season becomes dramatically shorter and algal production in an extremely warm climate is ultimately constrained by the duration of the ice season at all latitudes. In the scenario driven by ensemble medians (
 <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 6E</xref>, stars), ice algal phenology shows nonlinear interactions between sea-ice conditions and algal growth (
