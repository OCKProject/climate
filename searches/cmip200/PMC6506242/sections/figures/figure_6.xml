  <p class="p">Spread of the sea-ice driver projections and extreme cases for (
   <bold class="bold">A</bold>) ice season duration, (
   <bold class="bold">B</bold>) maximum sea-ice thickness, (
   <bold class="bold">C</bold>) maximum snow depth, (
   <bold class="bold">D</bold>) minimum near-surface air temperature. The lines are the ensemble means of empirical density distribution medians (50th percentile as in 
   <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>) for the RCP8.5 scenario (2061â€“2100) simulations. The shaded areas indicate the interval between the ensemble means of the 10th and 90th percentiles from the same distributions. The purple lines show the sea-ice drivers derived from the extreme warm scenario. The bare ice scenario is identical to the ensemble mean except for the snow depth set to zero [gray line in (C)]. (
   <bold class="bold">E</bold>) The resulting ice algae phenology, expressed as the day of bloom peak (
   <italic class="italic">y</italic> axis) under different scenarios (historical, ensemble RCP8.5, ensemble RCP8.5 for bare ice experiment, and RCP8.5 of the warmest extreme among models) and as a function of sea-ice season duration (
   <italic class="italic">x</italic> axis) for all the simulations and latitudinal bands.
