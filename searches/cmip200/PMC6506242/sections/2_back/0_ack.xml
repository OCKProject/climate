Field for proofreading an earlier version of this work and to two anonymous reviewers for valuable comments. L.T. thanks colleagues from the BEPSII (Biogeochemical Exchange Processes at the Sea-Ice Interfaces) WG for valuable discussion on sea-ice matters during the past years and BEPSII funding agencies (CliC/IASC/SOLAS/SCAR) for making this network possible. M.V. acknowledges the availability of the

  <bold class="bold">Funding:</bold> M.V. acknowledges funding from DST/NRF through the South African National Antarctic Programme. 
  <bold class="bold">Author contributions:</bold> L.T. developed the original idea that led to this paper. M.V. and E.S. collected and analyzed the climate model simulations. L.T. prepared the combined physical forcings and performed and analyzed the biogeochemical model simulations. L.T. and M.V. wrote the main paper, with input from E.S. All authors discussed the results and implications and participated in the manuscript improvement at all stages. 
  <bold class="bold">Competing interests:</bold> The authors declare that they have no competing interests. 
  <bold class="bold">Data and materials availability:</bold> All climate model output data from the CMIP5 are publicly available at

Given that some data used in this study are currently not found on ESGF servers, they are made available from the corresponding author upon request, as well as the scripts to process them. The National Snow and Ice Data Center sea-ice concentration data and the ERA-Interim reanalysis data are publicly available through the respective web portals. The sea-ice biogeochemistry model is available on the BFM website
