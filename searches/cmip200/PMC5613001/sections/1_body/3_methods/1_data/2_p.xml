<p id="Par30" class="p">In order to investigate the influence of internal variability on the relationship between global warming and heatwaves, we employ a 21-member ensemble of a global climate model (Community Earth System Model; CESM). Specifically, version 1.0.4 was employed, which includes the Community Atmosphere Model version 4 at 1.875° × 2.5° global resolution

 </sup>. All ensemble members are driven by identical external forcings. From 1950–2005 all members are forced with historical anthropogenic greenhouse gas and aerosol concentrations, and natural forcings. From 2006–2100 prescribed RCP8.5 forcings are employed. Each member only differs in their initial conditions, where on the 1

 </sup>. Despite this minute alteration, a substantial amount of variability is induced across the ensemble providing an ideal platform for this study. We exclude the first 5 years of each historical simulation for spin-up. Since CESM’s historical simulation commences in 1950, we employ the 982-year control run as a proxy for the earlier historical period, as discussed below.
