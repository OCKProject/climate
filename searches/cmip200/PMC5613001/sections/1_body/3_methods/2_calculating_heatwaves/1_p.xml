 </sup>. In summary, daily T
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> must exceed the calendar-day 90
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> percentile for at least three consecutive days for a heatwave to be declared. The 90
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> percentile is calculated from a smoothed 15-day moving average, such that it is relative to the time of year as well as the location. We consider heatwaves occurring during an extended summer, spanning November-March in the Southern Hemisphere and May-September in the Northern Hemisphere. All heatwaves are calculated at the grid box level. To determine how heatwaves have changed relative to a climate under little anthropogenic influence, percentile periods span 1861â€“1890 in the CMIP5 models, and a random 30-year period selected from the control run for CESM. Note there no detectable differences in percentiles from 500 30-year periods in the CESM control
