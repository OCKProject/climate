 </sup>, since the hottest event is first calculated by the largest average of each discrete event, and the hottest heatwave day (i.e. the peak intensity) is then extracted from this event. It is plausible for the hottest annual day to either fall within an overall cooler heatwave event, or as part of hot weather lasting less than 3 days. This results in an annual value per characteristic for both experiments at each land-based grid box. Regional averages for each characteristic are computed for all “Giorgi” regions

Regional analysis also considers the change in return period for a 1-in-30-year peak intensity event relative to a pre-industrial climate; and changes in regional temperature, relative to global temperature (see below). Global maps for CMIP5 models (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>) were compiled after re-gridding heatwave characteristics of each model to 1° × 1°, while CESM global analysis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>) remained at the models’ native resolution.
