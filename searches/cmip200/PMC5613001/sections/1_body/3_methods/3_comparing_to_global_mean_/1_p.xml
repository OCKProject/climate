<p id="Par38" class="p">Using monthly data, annual area-weighted mean global temperature was calculated. Similar to heatwaves, anomalies in mean global temperature are calculated relative to 1861–1890 for the CMIP5 models and a random 30-year control period for CESM. This allows for an analysis on how global temperature has increased relative to the preindustrial world

 </sup>. Anomalies of 0.5 °C increments up to 5 °C were obtained, where a specific threshold is ‘reached’ when it occurs for at least 5 consecutive years. To investigate changes relative to each global warming threshold, each heatwave characteristic is extracted for the same 5-year period and averaged.
