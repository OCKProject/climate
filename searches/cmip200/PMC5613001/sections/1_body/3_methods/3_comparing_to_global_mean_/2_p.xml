<p id="Par39" class="p">Ordinary least squares regression coefficients, quantifying the relationship between global temperature increase and heatwaves, were calculated at the grid box level between the sustained 0.5 °C warming increments and each heatwave characteristic. We present the coefficients relative to 1 °C increases in global average temperature. The main exception is to the number of events, specifically over tropical regions, as discussed in section 2.1. Regression Coefficients were individually calculated per simulation, from which the ensemble median and spread were calculated. The CMIP5 ensemble median is presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>. Ensemble spread, defined as the difference between the 99

 <sup class="sup">st</sup> percentile, are presented for both CMIP5 and CESM in Fig.
