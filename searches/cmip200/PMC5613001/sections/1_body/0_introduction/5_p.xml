<p id="Par6" class="p">For the first time, the present study investigates how different characteristics of regional heatwaves change relative to mean global warming. While there has understandably been substantial focus on universal thresholds of 1.5 °C and 2 °C, this study also considers heatwave changes at warmer thresholds, giving insight on the future landscape of heatwaves if Paris Agreement targets are not upheld. Two global climate model ensembles are employed, the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5)

 </sup>. The former estimates projections across a suite of models of varying climate sensitivities, physical parameterizations and resolution, while the latter solely assesses the influence of internal variability (see Methods). Four heatwave characteristics are examined across a 5-month summer season, including the sum of heatwave days, the total number of discrete events, the length of the longest event and peak heatwave intensity

This combination of global mean temperature thresholds, climate models, and regional heatwave characteristics was purposely designed such that the findings of this study are immediately applicable to real-world heatwave adaptation and mitigation strategies that are centered on the agreed future global warming targets
