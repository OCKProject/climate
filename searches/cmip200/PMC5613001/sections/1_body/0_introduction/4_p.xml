<p id="Par5" class="p">While reported increases in regional extremes relative to global warming are concerning, it cannot be assumed that they are directly indicative of changes in heatwaves, since such studies have used simplified extreme temperature measures

 </sup>. Heatwaves are a distinctive type of extreme temperature event, where anomalous conditions must occur over consecutive days. Thus, they can be considered via a number of characteristics (e.g. intensity, frequency, duration), as opposed to a single daily value that underpins annual maxima and minima events. According to many definitions, heatwaves are persistent exceedances of a given percentile, allowing for events to be relative to the regional climate

 <sup class="sup">.</sup> Moreover, the peak intensity of a heatwave is not necessarily the hottest day of a given year. Lastly, it is the sustained nature of heatwaves that impose more devastating impacts than extreme temperatures on a single day. Excessive human morbidity and mortality rates are clearly associated with sustained extreme temperatures

 </sup>. Since simplified measures of extreme temperature cannot deliver key information on heatwaves, an explicit investigation on how regional heatwave characteristics will change relative to global warming is warranted, however is currently lacking in the climate science literature. We anticipate that changes in heatwave frequency, intensity and duration relative to global warming will be highly regionally variable and will differ from prior work on more general measures of temperature extremes
