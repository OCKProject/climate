<p id="Par26" class="p">It is important to note that some degree of uncertainty remains in terms of the global climate response to increased anthropogenic influence, and in terms of how regional heatwaves will change. The transient climate response of the CMIP5 models (i.e. the response of global temperature to a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide at 1% increase per year over 70 years) varies between 1.2 °C and 2.4 °C

 </sup>. Moreover, the resolution of global climate models is likely too coarse to fully simulate such processes (e.g. synoptic systems and land surface interactions) and their intricate connections, rendering projections of heatwaves general approximations. All these factors and more undoubtedly contribute to the spread in the pace of regional heatwave changes and their relationships to global temperature increases among the CMIP5 ensemble, which we have shown here. Thus, it is advisable that a single, or small group of models is 
 <italic class="italic">not</italic> employed to comprehensively explore the implications of global temperature change on regional heatwaves for impacts purposes, as it cannot be guaranteed that key, underpinning physical processes and physical responses will be adequately represented by such a sample. While a bigger model ensemble introduces a larger range of responses (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>), it is imperative this is accounted for when examining the influence specific global warming thresholds - it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to know what the true response of the climate system to such targets will be.
