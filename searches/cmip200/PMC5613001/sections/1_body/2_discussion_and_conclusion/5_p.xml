 </sup> should not be deemed incorrect if the true change is within the regional range of internal variability. It is worth highlighting the important difference between the influences of variability per universal threshold, and on the overall trajectory of heatwaves discussed above. The latter assumes a particular course variability will take, as sampled by the 21 ensemble CESM members, where little influence on the rate of heatwave changes is measured across the sample. However, we do not know what the future course of climate variability will be, and a similar overall trend can result in different absolute changes at specific universal temperatures. Moreover, due to computational limitations, the analysis of internal variability in this study is limited to one physical model (CESM). It is plausible that other climate models, should they provide an appropriate ensemble, will differ in their estimated influence of internal variability on heatwave changes relative to global warming

 </sup>. However, the use of the CESM ensemble against CMIP5 clearly demonstrates that the structural and physical differences across climate models, and not internal variability, largely accounts for the variation in the scaling of heatwaves against global warming. While we believe a qualitatively similar result would be gained from a using a different climate model with a multi-member ensemble, future work could endeavor to test this hypothesis.
