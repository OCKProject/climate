 </sup>. A novel aspect of this study involves separately investigating changes in multiple heatwave characteristics (intensity, frequency and duration) relative to global warming – until now, we have not known how regional heatwaves will change when particular global warming thresholds are reached. This is an essential addition to the literature because the vast array of adverse impacts caused by heatwaves

 </sup> are due to their distinctive characteristics. As such, it cannot be assumed that changes in more simplistic measures of extreme temperature directly correlate to changes in heatwaves. While the discussed relationships between increasing global temperature and heatwave intensity and duration are respectively comparable to increases in annual maximum temperature

 </sup>, they are not identical. Moreover, for the first time, this study has established the alarmingly fast rate of increase in heatwave days over many regions relative to global warming, as well as the transition to a constant heatwave state over tropical regions within the bounds of the Paris Agreement. Our results highlight the clear advantages of limiting global warming to 1.5 °C

Additionally, we have provided new insight into how heatwaves will change relative to warming thresholds beyond 2 °C, which has not been previously established in the scientific literature. These are essential to consider so that we are prepared for such conditions if the 1.5° and 2 °C benchmarks are exceeded. Indeed, knowing such increases beyond 2 °C strengthens the importance of ensuring the success of the Paris Agreement. Future work could involve investigating the role of the land surface in amplifying regional heatwaves, in addition to links with global temperature rise
