<p id="Par22" class="p">While median projections from the CMIP5 ensemble are useful in approximating heatwave changes per global warming threshold, utilizing the multi-member CESM ensemble has shed light on the influence internal climate variability. Our results suggest that the overall rate at which all heatwave characteristics change per °C warming is largely independent from internal variability (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b,d,f and h</xref>). This means that despite what sequence of internal variability actually occurs, the overall speed of heatwave changes relative to global warming will be extremely similar. As such, it is the overall physical representation of the climate system, as governed by the choice of model, that will largely dictate the rate of change in heatwaves per °C of global warming (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a,c,e and f</xref>; Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). This is amplified over tropical regions for heatwave frequency and duration, where overall projected changes in heatwaves are also the greatest

 </sup> (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Even over higher latitudes, the rate of change per °C global warming in heatwave days, number, duration and peak intensity may vary by as much as 24 days; 2–2.5 discrete events; 10 days; and 1.5–3 °C respectively, dependent on the choice of climate model/s used.
