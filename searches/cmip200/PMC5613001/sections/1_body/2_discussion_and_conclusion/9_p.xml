<p id="Par28" class="p">In summary, for the first time, the present study has demonstrated the varying and concerning rates regional heatwave intensity, frequency and duration are projected to change, relative to global warming. While universal targets, such as those outlined in the Paris Agreement, are essential for global action on climate change, they present very different trajectories at the regional scale. It is imperative that such trajectories are well understood, inclusive of uncertainties due to internal climate variability and the overall response of the climate system to increased anthropogenic forcing, so that effective, long-term adaptation and mitigation heatwave policies are well-informed. Moreover, to avoid considerable changes to the nature of regional heatwaves it is absolutely crucial that global warming is minimized within the bounds of the Paris agreement. This study is the first to explicitly analyse how different characteristics of regional heatwaves will change relative to global warming beyond 2 °C, which will likely infer devastating impacts if anthropogenic climate change is not constrained as soon as possible.</p>
