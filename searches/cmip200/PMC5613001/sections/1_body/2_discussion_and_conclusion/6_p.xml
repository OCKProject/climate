<p id="Par25" class="p">It is also critical to highlight the substantial differences in heatwave changes, dependent on the overall amount of global warming reached, and what this may infer for impacts. For example, anywhere between 3 to 20 extra heatwave days will be expected on average between global warming thresholds of 1.5 °C and 2 °C, where peak heatwave intensity will warm by approximately 0.5 °C, depending on the region (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). While changes in most regional heatwave characteristics are predominantly linear relative to global warming, this does not infer that changes in the 
 <italic class="italic">impacts</italic> of heatwaves will also be linear

 </sup>. For example, Australian fruit bats perish at specific temperature thresholds

 </sup>. Increases in peak heatwave intensity beyond these thresholds may see this species (and others) wiped out entirely, particularly when combined with perpetual heatwave conditions. Similarly, public infrastructure may be far more prone to failure as perpetual heatwaves become the new normal

 </sup>, having knock-on effects to public health resources. Adding additional complexity, the timeframe of these potentially catastrophic impacts will be highly regional, dependent on local heatwave changes relative to the total amount of global warming reached, as well as the underlying vulnerability of the local population
