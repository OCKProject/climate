<p id="Par23" class="p">However, there is considerable influence from internal variability when projecting changes in heatwaves per individual global warming threshold, as opposed to the overall relationship (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>; Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). Over some regions and for some heatwave characteristics, internal variability accounts for at least 50% of the range of expected heatwave changes per ½ °C global warming, though in most cases explains between 20–30% of the range (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). This is an important point, since even if our understanding of the response of the climate system to anthropogenic forcing was perfected (i.e., we created a “flawless” physical climate model), a range of changes per global warming threshold should still be anticipated due to the influence of internal climate variability which remains unpredictable. Therefore, at the very least, fluctuations of the order of those presented in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref> should be employed in the construction of adaptation and mitigation policies regarding heatwave changes relative to specific global warming thresholds.
