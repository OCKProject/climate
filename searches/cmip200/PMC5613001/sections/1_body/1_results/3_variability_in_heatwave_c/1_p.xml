<p id="Par17" class="p">The results above are based on CMIP5 medians. However, variability exists among ensemble members, suggesting that the relationship between regional heatwave characteristics and global warming is model dependent to some extent (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Note that with the exception of peak intensity (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3f</xref>, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>) tropical regions display the greatest differences between models, which are also regions most sensitive to global temperature increases (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). The overall spread in changes of heatwave days per °C among the CMIP5 models may be as large as 40 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a</xref>), while the overall number of events and the duration of the longest event may differ by up to 4 events (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3c</xref>) and 30 days (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3e</xref>), respectively. This means that for a given threshold of global warming, the difference in projections between two climate models may be up to 40 heatwave days per season and 4 discrete events, respectively. Note that the spread is markedly reduced outside tropical regions, where heatwave days, event number and longest duration vary by 8–20 days, 1–2.5 events, and 4–12 days, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). This indicates higher model agreement on how sensitive heatwave changes are to global temperature increases over these areas. Ensemble spread in peak heatwave intensity shows no regional association, generally being between 1.5–2.5 °C (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3g</xref>; Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>).
