<p id="Par19" class="p">However, internal variability plays a larger role on the overall changes in regional heatwaves at a given global warming threshold. Over many regions, this role does not diminish as anthropogenic influence on the global climate increases (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>. and Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). In terms of regional increases in the number of heatwave days, internal climate variability may account for ~25–50% of the projected spread when each ½ °C threshold is reached (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). For the number of events, the duration of the longest event and peak intensity, internal climate variability may respectively account for 21–70%, 12%–35%, and 28%–67% of the projected variation, depending on the region. In general, this influence is larger over higher latitude regions (e.g. ALA, CAN, NEU) than those in the tropics (e.g. AMZ, SEA, WAF). Moreover, influence of internal variability is consistent through time over most regions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>), with the exception of the tropics (AMZ), where the influence of internal variability diminishes as global temperature increases. Thus, while the average rate of change in heatwaves relative to global warming is largely dependent on the physical representation of the climate system, internal climate variability should also be taken into account when determining the overall regional change projected per specific global warming threshold.
