 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b,d,f and h</xref> suggest that the influence from internal climate variability is relatively low. For all heatwave characteristics, the coefficient per °C varies little regionally, and is fractional compared to the respective spread of the CMIP5 ensemble. A spread of no more than 4 days (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b</xref>), 0.5 events (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3d</xref>), 3 days (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3f</xref>), and 0.5 °C (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3h</xref>) can be expected per °C of global warming for the number of heatwave days, total number of events, the length of the longest event and peak intensity, respectively, due to the internal variability of the climate system. Thus, any variation in the rate of heatwave changes is largely dependent on physical differences between climate models (e.g. processes resolved, parameterization schemes, resolution, overall climate sensitivity).
