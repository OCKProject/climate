<p id="Par12" class="p">Regional changes in heatwave days (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref>) are mostly linear, with a large spread. Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref> also supports Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref>, where more rapid increases in heatwave days relative to global temperature occur over tropical regions compared to those at higher latitudes. By 5 °C global warming, the number of heatwave days per season could increase by between 60 days (SSA) to 120 days (EAF, AMZ, WAF), suggesting that heatwave conditions will become the new normal if 5 °C global warming is reached. From 1 °C warming, a regional divergence is evident, where lower latitude regions start to display faster increases in heatwave days. Note that regions with larger overall increases display slower rates of change above 2.5–3 °C, as the maximum number of seasonal heatwave days (~150) is approached. These results indicate that the threshold of global warming reached manifests differently in terms of regional changes in heatwave days.
