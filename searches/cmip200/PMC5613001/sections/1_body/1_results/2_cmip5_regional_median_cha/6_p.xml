<p id="Par16" class="p">Regional median return intervals of intense heatwaves projected by CMIP5 also diminish at a non-linear rate per global warming threshold (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). By 4 °C global warming or earlier, almost all regions experience an intense heatwave yearly that occurred only once every 30 years between 1861–1890. Across all regions, there is a large difference in return intervals between 1.5 °C and 2.5 °C global warming. In some cases, an intense heatwave occurs twice as often at 2.5 °C (e.g. GRL, WNA, AUS), and over other regions this increase in frequency between 1.5 °C and 2.5 °C is nearer to 3-fold (e.g. TIB, ENA). Lower thresholds of global warming will therefore mean that the occurrences of extremely intense events are kept to a minimum.
