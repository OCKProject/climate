 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2d</xref> displays a highly linear increase in regional median peak heatwave intensity relative to global warming. Consistent with previous studies

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>
 </sup> the largest increase occurs over the Mediterranean (MED), where heatwave intensity could be 9 °C hotter in a 5 °C world, relative to a pre-industrial climate. In a 2.5 °C world, heatwaves could be an extra 2.5 °C (AUS, SSA) to 5 °C (MED, CAS) warmer. This is a notable increase compared to a world at 1.5 °C, where heatwaves are approximately 2 °C (EAS, SSA) to 3 °C (MED, CAS) warmer.
