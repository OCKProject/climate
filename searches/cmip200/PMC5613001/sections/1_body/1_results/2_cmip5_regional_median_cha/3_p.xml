<p id="Par13" class="p">It is clear that regional changes in the number of seasonal heatwaves and global temperature increase are not linearly associated (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b</xref>). Indeed, there is a decrease in events for some lower latitude regions at 1.5–2 °C (EAF, AMZ) and 3 °C warming (WAF, SAH), resulting in a negative median coefficient for some regions (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). For most other regions, the rate of increase in heatwave events slows at around 3 °C global warming, with some regions demonstrating a decline from 4.5 °C (SEA, SAS, MED). When considered in conjunction with Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref>, it is likely that large increases in heatwave days are resulting in long, continuous events without any reprieve. At 1.5 °C warming, the number of events can increase by 2 (NAS, NEU) to over 6 extra events per season (WAF, AMZ, EAF). Such results indicate the high sensitivity of heatwave frequency to the total amount of global warming reached.
