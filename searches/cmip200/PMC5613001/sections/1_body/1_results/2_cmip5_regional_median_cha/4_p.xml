<p id="Par14" class="p">The duration of the longest event (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2c</xref>) is most rapid over tropical regions (SAH, AMZ, CAM, EAF), similar to Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b</xref>. Note that if 5 °C of global warming is reached, heatwaves in these regions could last for over 80 days. However, if warming were limited to 2 or 3 °C, they would be substantially shorter at 20, and 40–50 days, respectively. Most other regions see a sharper increase from 3.5 °C, suggesting that the length of heatwaves are more sensitive to higher increases in global temperature in these regions. Over these regions, a global warming limit of 2.5 °C could result in heatwaves that are an extra 5–20 days in length, relative to pre-industrial times.
