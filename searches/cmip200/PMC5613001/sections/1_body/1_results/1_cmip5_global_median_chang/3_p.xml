<p id="Par9" class="p">The median change in the longest heatwave duration per season (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1c</xref>) is mostly between 1–3 days, with smaller increases at higher latitudes. Slightly larger increases of 4–6 days are projected per degree of global warming over India, southeast Asia, the United States and southern America. However, the longest event of the season is projected to increase by 10–12 days per degree of global warming across Central America, parts of Africa and the Middle East.
