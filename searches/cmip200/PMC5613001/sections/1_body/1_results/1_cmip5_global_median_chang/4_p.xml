<p id="Par10" class="p">Over some regions, changes in heatwave amplitude (hottest heatwave day per season, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1d</xref>) are reasonably similar to increases in in global temperature. Over Australia and southeast Asia, heatwave amplitude is projected to increase approximately 1:1 with global temperature. For large parts of the world, the increase in heatwave amplitude is between 1.2–1.5 °C per degree of global warming, with values of up to 1.8 °C over the United States, parts of Africa and South America, and 2 °C over Europe.
