 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> displays the CMIP5 ensemble median change in each heatwave characteristic per degree warming throughout the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> Century. Heatwave days (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref>) show the most striking changes in the tropics, with over 30 extra heatwave days per season over large parts of Africa, Central and South America and South East Asia, per °C of global temperature rise. This change is less severe in the mid to high latitudes, where 10–15 extra days are expected over Northern America, Europe and Russia. Over southern Australia and South America, a median of 4–8 extra heatwave days is expected for each degree of global warming.
