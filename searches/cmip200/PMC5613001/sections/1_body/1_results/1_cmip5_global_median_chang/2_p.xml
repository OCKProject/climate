<p id="Par8" class="p">Over most regions, the number of heatwaves per season (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b</xref>) is projected to increase by approximately 1.5–2 events per degree of global warming. The exception is over central and southern Africa and central Asia, where a median increase of 2.5 events per season is projected. However, caution is recommended in interpreting changes in heatwave events per °C over some regions, as discussed further in Section 3.2.
