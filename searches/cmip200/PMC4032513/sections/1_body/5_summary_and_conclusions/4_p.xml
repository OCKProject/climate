<p class="p">The major water masses are generally poorly represented, with a broad warm bias throughout the water column, and SAMW/AAIW also tends to be too fresh. The mode water bias arises partially due to the mixed layer where they are formed being biased too shallow, too far equatorward and too warm. Overstrong freshwater airâ€“sea fluxes appear to drive the shallow MLD bias via overstratification, although this is hard to verify as buoyancy flux observations are so sparse. Under future forcing, these biases are enhanced and the water column warms, mode waters freshen and the MLD shoals in almost all models, as in CMIP3. Also consistent with CMIP3 is the reduction in AABW formation and its increase in salinity. The large variability in water mass temperature may account in part for the dramatic inter-model variability in SIE, seasonal change and regional variability, although many other factors are also at play. SIE tends to be biased low in the HIST scenario, and the observed increase in recent decades is not replicated. There is no significant improvement of SIE in CMIP5 from CMIP3 and, as in CMIP3, future forcing almost universally reduces SIE.</p>
