<p class="p">The various eddy transport schemes used in CMIP5 are also likely to strongly control the ACC transport, MOC and influence meridional heat and freshwater transport. Unfortunately, despite the recommendations of earlier CMIP3 studies [

 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>], neither eddy property transports nor 
 <italic class="italic">κ</italic> values were made widely available in CMIP5 models, and so presently it is very difficult to examine the known sensitivity of the ACC circulation against varying 
 <italic class="italic">κ</italic> using this dataset. This problem also extends to the analysis of the MOC, where eddies play a vital role in setting the residual circulation. Eddy metrics will become increasingly important in future iterations of CMIP models as they steadily increase in resolution and more models approach eddy-permitting (approx. 1/4 degree) resolutions. At this point, comprehensive eddy and 
 <italic class="italic">κ</italic> statistics will be needed to determine the relative impact of resolution and parametrization schemes, as well as understanding the ACC and MOC responses to changes in climate forcing. It is therefore vital that future iterations of CMIP make both eddy statistics and the spatial pattern of parametrization schemes widely available. Bottom pressure torque has also been identified as a potentially important factor for assessing the ACC transport and gyre circulation and so should also be included in future model output [
