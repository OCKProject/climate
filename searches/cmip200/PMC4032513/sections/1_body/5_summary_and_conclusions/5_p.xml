<p class="p">This review highlights a number of areas where significant disagreements exist between models in both the HIST state and the modelled responses to future climate forcing. These notably include the ACC transport, surface buoyancy flux-driven water mass formation of SAMW, AAIW and AABW, SIE and subpolar gyre dynamics. These problems have many contributing and inter-related factors, but two principal problems stand out: first, the variability of both HIST and future surface heat and particularly freshwater fluxes over the Southern Ocean; and second, the difficulty of accurately representing numerous processes occurring in the subpolar zone.</p>
