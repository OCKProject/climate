<p class="p">By integrating a number of studies of the CMIP5 ensemble in the Southern Ocean together, a picture emerges of it as a ‘better CMIP3’ [

Despite the larger ensemble of models, with typically better ocean resolutions, parametrization schemes, bathymetry and a much larger proportion of full ESMs, by and large the same initial biases and coherent changes under climate forcing occur as in CMIP3. Inter-model variability in both historical and future states does tend to be smaller than in CMIP3 for many metrics, and in the face of greater model complexity, this is definitely a positive step forward. There is still significant inter-model variability in the HIST state for many important metrics (e.g. ACC transport and SIE), but the multi-model mean does tend to be approaching the observed values, emphasizing the utility of larger model ensembles. However, most of the major problems in representing the historical state and disagreements in future change seen in CMIP3 also remain.
