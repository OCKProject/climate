<p class="p">The consistent changes in wind in both CMIP3 and CMIP5 but varied ACC, subpolar gyre and, to a lesser extent, MOC responses make it clear that changes in the meridional density structure are dominant over changes in the zonal wind stress in setting the ACC transport over centennial time scales. This is at least true for the relatively smaller changes in wind stress seen in the CMIP models. The fact that these models do not resolve eddies, and so the expected eddy saturation mechanism opposing wind-driven acceleration is largely absent, makes this lack of response to increased wind stress even more significant. Surface buoyancy fluxes also impact the properties of SAMW, AAIW, AABW and particularly SIE both directly in their formation regions and indirectly through setting the background stratification and impacting the mixed layer properties. This is not an easy problem to address, largely owing to the poorly observed nature of surface buoyancy fluxes in general and particularly in the Southern Ocean. Better observational and reanalysis estimates of these fluxes are essential to tuning model fluxes and hopefully providing a more consistent water mass structure in these coupled climate models, particularly in the Southern Ocean, where sloping isopycnals result in much of the water column intersecting with the ventilated layer.</p>
