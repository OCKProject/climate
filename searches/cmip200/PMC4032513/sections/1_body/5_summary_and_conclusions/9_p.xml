<p class="p">Ultimately, all of the above factors are intricately linked in the Southern Ocean and a concerted effort, particularly south of the ACC, is required to disentangle the complex processes and feedbacks that control this system, which ultimately impacts SIE, the ACC and MOC and, through these, the wider climate. As models increase in complexity and resolution into the future, the addition of eddy-permitting models, dynamic ice sheets and ice shelves and more complex biogeochemistry to this picture will complicate things further. These additions increase the potential for inter-model variability in the Southern Ocean to impact climate and sea levels in highly nonlinear ways on centennial time scales, increasing overall uncertainty in global climate response to anthropogenic forcing. This highlights the need for wider and more uniformly formatted metadata availability, as well as model set-up parameters (e.g. eddy bolus diffusion coefficients) to be output as well as physical variables in order to facilitate meta-analysis of model set-up choices and their impact on the representation of the climate system.</p>
