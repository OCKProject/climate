<p class="p">The subpolar regime is the product of many different coupled processes and factors including: sea-ice formation, extent and seasonality, surface buoyancy fluxes, meridional eddy transport, surface wind stress, background stratification, mixed layer depth and seasonality, as well as topographic steering and blocking. The relative importance of each of these processes varies regionally and is not always well established observationally, and presently it is difficult to know how efforts at improving model fidelity in one aspect will influence the wider region. That said, the presence of unphysical deep open-ocean convection in many models is a worrying sign that regional dynamics needs considerable attention. Unfortunately, those models with deep convection often also achieve the most accurate AABW representation, although this probably comes at the cost of inaccurate SIE and subpolar gyre dynamics. A parametrized approach to AABW formation, or perhaps higher regional resolutions in formation areas, may be a solution to this problem. This may also go some way to improving the variability of vertical stratification south of the ACC, which presently contributes to dramatically different rates of deep warming and consequent modification of meridional density gradients, ACC transport and presumably the MOC. This impact on the Southern Ocean density gradients and MOC is also likely to have a significant impact on the subduction/outgassing of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and other biogeochemical tracers. The potential for climate feedbacks due to changes in the MOC in ESMs is likely to be the subject of much attention in CMIP5.
