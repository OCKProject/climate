<p class="p">This physically unrealistic deep convection in the Weddell and Ross Gyres may be one possible cause of the poor relationships between wind stress curl and subpolar gyre strength reported in both CMIP3 [
 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>] and CMIP5 [
 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. It may also influence the broader structure of the gyres, and the dramatic differences in size and strength of open-ocean convection between models may go some way to explaining the large variance in strength and structure of the subpolar gyres between models. For example, in some models, a ‘supergyre’ forms, consisting of the Weddell and Australian–Antarctic Gyres, or, in extreme cases, all three gyres. The variability between models of the HIST gyre states is reduced in CMIP5 relative to CMIP3, but the inter-model standard deviations are still over 50% of the multi-model mean [
 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. As noted in §3
 <italic class="italic">a</italic>, there is a strong relationship between the change in overall size of the subpolar gyres and the change in ACC transport under climate forcing, but it is unclear which variable is driving the other, or if both are responding to an outside force. Certainly, the presence of deep open-ocean convection in some models will also result in changes to the isopycnal structure- and eddy-induced transport, as well as enhancing the vertical transport of surface properties through reduced stratification. Although the role of eddies, model viscosity, bottom form stress and the presence of free circumpolar wind forced modes have all been suggested as possible contributors, there is no firm consensus on what is driving the inter-model variability of subpolar hydrography [
