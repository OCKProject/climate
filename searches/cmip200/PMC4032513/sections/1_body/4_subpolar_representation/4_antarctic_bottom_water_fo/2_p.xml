 <italic class="italic">a</italic>, the HIST AABW representation over the whole Southern Ocean varies significantly between models in terms of volume, temperature and salinity. This variance is due to the difficulty in accurately representing the complex chain of interactions between water masses, sea ice, winds, bathymetry and ice shelves/sheets that combine to drive AABW formation. Simplistically, AABW formation takes place over the continental shelves during Austral winter in relatively small regions of intense sea-ice formation known as polynya. Dense shelf water formed in this way either spreads over the shelves, as in the Ross and Weddell Seas, or fills bathymetric depressions, as in East Antarctica, before cascading over the shelf break and reaching abyssal depths. Ten of 15 CMIP5 models successfully form dense shelf water in Austral winter but none of these models produced AABW from shelf sources [
 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. This is probably due to spurious horizontal mixing as dense water moves down the slope, resulting in the shelf water mixing with intermediate-depth water masses. Interestingly, however, the four isopycnal coordinate models tested did not perform significantly better at forming AABW than 
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>-level models, implying that the problem is likely to be a result of more than one model deficiency. Around half the models examined still have relatively realistic AABW properties, but these were produced through physically unrealistic open-ocean deep convection north of the shelf break, often to full depth. This occurs largely in the Weddell and Ross Gyres, and is a process that is very rarely observed in the Southern Ocean. The formation of these deep convection cells appears to linked to over-vigorous sea-ice seasonal cycles where summer SIE is too low, resulting in stronger than observed winter ice growth, brine rejection and hence overturning [
