 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C65" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>]. An assessment of the SIE in 19 CMIP5 models in the HIST scenario over 1860–2005, with a focus on the period 1979–2005, finds that the majority of models do a poor job in re-creating both the seasonal cycle and the maximum extent of observations [
 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C66" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>]. The multi-model mean SIE between 1979 and 2005 is biased below that of the observations by around 0.3×10

 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C67" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>], hides a great deal of variability between models, with some having zero SIE during the February minimum and others having three times the observed value of around 3×10

 <sup class="sup">2</sup> between the smallest and largest SIE. In the multi-model mean, there is a pronounced negative trend in SIE beginning after the first 50 years, which is continued into the 1979–2005 period.

 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C66" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>]. Examination of the spatial biases in SIE in the CMIP5 models is still preliminary, but early results reveal varied patterns of spatial variability across models, and a general failure to reproduce the largest spatial mode of change: reduction in the Amundsen–Bellingshausen Sea and expansion near the Ross Gyre [
 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C66" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>]. This is due at least partially to the failure of CMIP5 models to consistently re-create the Amundsen–Bellingshausen Sea low-pressure system and its response to changes in the SAM. Hosking 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>] find that this bias (which varies between models and within models across seasons) also leads to correspondingly poor re-creation of surface air temperatures and errors in Antarctic climate, particularly in West Antarctica and the Antarctic Peninsula. They note, however, that the errors in the low-pressure system are at a minimum when SIE errors are at a maximum in February and warn against attributing too much of the SIE errors to winds. The trend towards SIE reduction continues into the future warming scenarios, and all but one model (in an ensemble of seven) have decreasing sea-ice volume over the twenty-first century in the RCP4.5 scenario [
