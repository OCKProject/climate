<p class="p">Attributing these SIE biases and trends is difficult owing to the large number of processes that influence them. Examination of long-term unforced CMIP5 control runs shows that significant drifts do occur in these models, but that these do not have significant impact on the forced trends. Instead, the bias in absolute SIE at the start of forced integrations has a much larger impact on total SIE, and this appears to be established very quickly after the start of control runs. What causes this initial offset is unknown, although there is a correlation of around 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>=0.4 between the temperature of the deep CDW well removed from the sea-ice zone (below 2000 dbar and north of 50Â°S) and the mean HIST SIE, with warmer models having less sea ice. Other studies also observe this link between ocean temperatures and SIE [

 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C68" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>]. Ocean temperatures, and particularly the positive biases present in CDW, are therefore likely to have a significant impact on SIE representation, but the relatively weak correlation indicates that other factors are at work. These are not presently well understood, although progress is being made on the relative influence of dynamic versus thermodynamic effects [
