<p class="p">It is possible that the observed positive SIE trend may be due to intrinsic natural variability that masks a decrease due to climate forcing. Simply based on the number of CMIP5 ensembles that increase in SIE rather than decrease in the HIST run, there is only around a one in 10 chance that the observed trend is a result of intrinsic variability aliasing the climatic trend. However, given the inaccuracy with which the models reproduce most aspects of the SIE, it seems unlikely that the CMIP5 ensemble intrinsic variability is representative of the real world and so may not be an effective way of establishing the nature of the observed trend [

 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C70" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>] and many of the individual model biases of CMIP3 are repeated in CMIP5 [

This is despite the improvements in ozone forcing and atmospheric chemistry in CMIP5, implying that other factors are at play in driving the observed gain of sea ice. The absence of dynamic ice-sheet melt in the HIST run does not appear to be a significant factor in the poor HIST SIE representation [
