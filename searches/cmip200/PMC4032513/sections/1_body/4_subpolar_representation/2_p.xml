<p class="p">South of the ACC the subpolar regime consists of the Antarctic shelf seas, as well as the Ross, Weddell and Australianâ€“Antarctic Gyres. The huge seasonal cycle of sea-ice cover in these regions has a dramatic impact on the thermal and hydrological cycles of the Southern Ocean and on the formation and export of AABW. The fine balance and small scale of interactions between atmosphere, ocean, sea ice, ice shelves and ice sheets (not included explicitly in CMIP3 or CMIP5) means that this region is extremely challenging to model accurately.</p>
