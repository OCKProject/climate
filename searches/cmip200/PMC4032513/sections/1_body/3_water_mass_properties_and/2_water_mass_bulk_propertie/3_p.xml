<p class="p">In common with CMIP3 [
 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C55" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>], the sub-Antarctic mode water (SAMW) and AAIW are generally poorly represented. The potential vorticity minimum is found to be too light and in different locations to observations. The winter-time mixed layer is generally biased too far north and too deep, particularly in the western Indian and Pacific basins. This results in subtropical mode waters rather than SAMW, which subsequently penetrates less deeply and at lighter water mass classes, as also occurred in CMIP3 [
 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C56" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. This light bias is itself a result of large inputs of heat and freshwater (multi-model mean salinity of 34.5 Sp and temperature of 11.4°C relative to observations of 34.6 Sp and 9.2°C, respectively) in the SAMW formation regions [
 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. AAIW forms as the densest class of SAMW in a relatively small region to the west of and in the Drake Passage, and the characteristics of AAIW in CMIP5 models are closely linked to the depth and properties of the mixed layers of this region [
 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. The AAIW freshwater and low-potential-vorticity tongue is generally well represented and closer to observations than the SAMW, although still tending to be biased too light by 0.2

 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>] is significantly reduced in CMIP5, possibly reflecting the more accurate representation of outcrop area [
 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>] and winter-time mixed layer depths in the south-east Pacific where AAIW is primarily formed [
