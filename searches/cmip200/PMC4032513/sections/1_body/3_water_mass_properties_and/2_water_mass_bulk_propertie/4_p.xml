<p class="p">The circumpolar deep water (CDW) has smaller biases relative to observations, although it still tends to be too warm (1.9°C relative to observational estimates of 1.3°C) and light. This probably reflects the distant formation of the CDW and the relatively weaker influence of biases in air–sea fluxes when compared with the SAMW/AAIW above and AABW below. The AABW exhibits the most dramatic variability across models of all the water masses. Its volume ranges from 3×10
 <sup class="sup">16</sup> to 14×10
 <sup class="sup">16</sup> m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>, with the multi-model mean being approximately 20% larger than the observational estimate. The water mass characteristics are similarly poorly simulated, with fresh or saline biases of over 0.9 Sp from the observed value in some models, but overall there tends to be a warm bias of 0.4°C and a salty bias of 0.6 Sp [
