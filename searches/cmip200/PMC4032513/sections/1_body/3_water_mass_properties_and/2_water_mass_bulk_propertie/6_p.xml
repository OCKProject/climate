<p class="p">These water mass changes, which are of relatively consistent sign across CMIP5 models, are in general agreement with the changes observed in CMIP3 [

 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. The only exception appears to be the CDW, which exhibits a weak salinification in CMIP3, whereas, in CMIP5, there is a weak (around 0.01 Sp in most models) freshening. This may be due to the water mass definitions used [
 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>], which may conflate some CDW with AABW where there is a clear salinification trend. The persistent warming of the water column in CMIP5 comes in all models despite a varied ACC positional response. This puts a stronger emphasis on surface warming driving the deep trend than in CMIP3, where it was argued that the more coherent poleward shift of water masses could account for much of the warming [
 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. The heat uptake by the Southern Ocean under climate forcing represents up to 40% of the total global value in CMIP5 [
 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C59" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>], with global heat uptake peaking above 700 m in the SAMW/AAIW formation regions, and on the southern flank of the ACC below 2000 m. There are no dramatic differences between CMIP3 and CMIP5 in terms of heat uptake efficiency, but there is a clear link between those models with weaker stratification and enhanced heat uptake. This in turn may be linked to the eddy diffusivity coefficient, whereby weaker
