<p class="p">Under RCP4.5, there is a very consistent warming of the water column by the end of the century of between 1 and 1.3°C, concentrated largely in the subtropical, mode and intermediate waters, with RCP8.5 warming being around 30–60% stronger [
 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]. Salinity changes are less vertically coherent, with consistently strong freshening of the SAMW and AAIW by 0.03 and 0.06 Sp respectively (double this for RCP8.5), driven by increases in freshwater fluxes into their formation regions [
 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. CDW changes by the end of the twenty-first century tend to be less dramatic, probably due to the relatively long lag in propagating changes from the North Atlantic to the Southern Ocean. By contrast, the AABW experiences a significant increase in salinity of around 0.02 Sp and warms by over 0.3°C. Although the warming tends to agree with observations [
 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>], the freshening is in opposition to the observed trend [
 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C58" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>] and may be a result of the lack of ice-shelf interaction in CMIP5 models or possibly enhanced sea-ice formation in winter owing to reduced summer SIEs driving enhanced brine rejection [
