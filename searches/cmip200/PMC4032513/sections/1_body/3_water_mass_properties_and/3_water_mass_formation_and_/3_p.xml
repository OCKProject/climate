<p class="p">Under climate forcing, almost all CMIP5 models simulate a freshening and warming of the maximum MLD that is stronger under RCP8.5 than RCP4.5 [
 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. This leads to a shoaling of the MLD maximum by up to 30 m (mean 20 m) and 100 m (mean 40 m) for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively. This appears to be driven by a reduction in the winter-time buoyancy loss, particularly in the SAMW/AAIW formation regions (

 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C55" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]. Interestingly, the response of the MLD to surface warming and freshening exhibits a strong state dependence, with those models with the shallowest MLD also displaying the smallest shoaling, whereas deeper initial conditions result in larger reductions. This is particularly the case in the eastern Pacific, where the correlation between initial state and the magnitude of change is

 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. This state bias may mean that future shoaling is underestimated owing to the shallow bias in HIST MLD.
