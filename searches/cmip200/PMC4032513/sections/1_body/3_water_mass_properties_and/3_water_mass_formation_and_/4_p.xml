<p class="p">So why is the MLD biased shallow in the Southern Ocean, and what are the implications for the ventilation of the ocean interior? Unlike observations where air–sea buoyancy fluxes along with Ekman contributions are found to be critical in setting the mixed layer properties [
 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C60" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>], there is only a weak anticorrelation between surface buoyancy fluxes and MLD in CMIP5, and none at all when Ekman fluxes are included [
 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. Instead, in regions of deep winter MLD where SAMW and AAIW form, the stratification at the base of the winter mixed layer is more than twice that of observations. In the models with the most biased MLD, this stratification tends to arise due to a positive (fresh and stable) bias in the haline component. The strength of the haline bias explains much of the inter-model MLD variance (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>=0.5), whereas the thermal stratification plays a negligible role. Despite their weak relationship with the MLD itself, the combined air–sea heat and freshwater fluxes are strongly (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>=0.9) related to the stratification at the base of the mixed layer. In general, the freshwater buoyancy component (44 W m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>) dominates the thermal component (−31 W m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>) in the SAMW/AAIW formation regions. The poorly known observational value of surface heat and freshwater fluxes means that it is presently difficult to assess the relative accuracy of these model values. Strong increases in both surface heat and freshwater fluxes at high latitudes are predicted under future climate forcing [
 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C61" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>], but, despite the strong relationship between surface buoyancy fluxes and stratification at the base of the mixed layer in the HIST scenario, there does not appear to be a coherent or large change in stratification at the base of the mixed layer under future climate forcing, resulting in the dominance of surface buoyancy fluxes in controlling MLD properties under future climate forcing. Another possible cause of the shallow bias may be due to underestimating the high-frequency wind variability [
 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C62" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>], although this has not yet been investigated in depth in CMIP5.
