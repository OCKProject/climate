<p class="p">The volumetric exchange between water masses in the HIST scenario of CMIP5 was investigated by applying a Walin [

 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]. Upwelled CDW/AAIW is transformed to SAMW and around 7 Sv of CDW to AABW through surface buoyancy fluxes. Interestingly, no net AAIW is formed directly on the surface due to buoyancy fluxes, and instead an upwelling of around 6 Sv occurs in this class and around 13 Sv is converted to modified CDW densities, where a total of around 11 Sv is subsequently subducted and exported northwards. Interior mixing tends to transform this subducted SAMW back into AAIW classes. The net formation of AAIW from SAMW via ocean interior processes is consistent with CMIP3 [
