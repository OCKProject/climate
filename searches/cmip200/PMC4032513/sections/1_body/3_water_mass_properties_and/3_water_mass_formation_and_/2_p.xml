<p class="p">The water mass properties described above are controlled by surface buoyancy fluxes and mixing in the ocean interior and seasonal surface mixed layer. The mixed layer, in particular, is fundamental to the formation and SAMW and AAIW and subsequent entrainment of surface properties into the deep ocean. In CMIP5, the Austral summer mixed layer depth (MLD) tends to be around 50 m, except in the band between 50 and 60°S where depths reach 60–90 m [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTA20130296F3" class="xref">figure 3</xref>). In Austral winter, the deeper central band narrows and shifts equatorwards onto the northern edge of the ACC, deepening to as much as 400–700 m. The regions of deep convection extend much further into the subtropics than do observations and contribute to the over-warm SAMW and AAIW and the subduction of subtropical mode water identified in the previous section. Despite the wider extent of deep mixed layers, the multi-model mean in winter is still 100–200 m shallower, on average, than observations. Although qualitatively there appears to be an improvement in MLD spatial distribution relative to CMIP3 [
 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>], there remains significant spatial variability of MLD between models, particularly of the winter maxima. The spatial accuracy of the band of MLD maxima associated with SAMW and AAIW formation varies considerably between models, with a range of spatial correlations with observations ranging from 0.2 to 0.8 [
 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. Errors are notable in the Indian Ocean sector where the MLD maximum is biased too far equatorward in many models, and similarly in the Pacific where deep mixed layers do not extend far enough westward. In some models, these northward biases appear to be correlated with the equatorward bias of the wind stress maxima, but, in others, large MLD position biases exist where the wind stress maximum is better represented.
