<p class="p">There is very large inter-model variability in the numbers associated with both formation and destruction of water masses on the surface and interior processes, with the variability often significantly larger than the multi-model mean (

The largest uncertainties tend to be associated with surface freshwater fluxes, but if extreme model outliers are removed, then there is firm agreement in the dominant contribution of freshwater fluxes to the upwelling of CDW and subduction of SAMW across models. Under the RCP4.5/8.5 scenarios, the upwelling of CDW increases, largely driven by enhanced (7±9 
 <italic class="italic">Sv</italic>) interior transformation of AAIW to CDW. This extra AAIW is formed through enhanced surface fluxes of CDW to AAIW classes driving greater AAIW subduction. The enhanced subduction balances the acceleration of the upper cell of the MOC determined from the residual circulation by Downes

This implies that the enhanced circulation is confined to the Southern Ocean through enhanced interior mixing, though where and by what process are still unclear. The formation of AABW due to surface buoyancy fluxes and its export across 30°S is reduced under both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, principally due to enhanced surface warming.
