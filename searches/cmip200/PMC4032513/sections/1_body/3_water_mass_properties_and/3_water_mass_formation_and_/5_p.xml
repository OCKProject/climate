<p class="p">The properties of the SAMW and AAIW are tightly coupled with the characteristics of the mixed layers in which they form. In the regions of SAMW formation, the MLD is correlated with the total volume of subducted water masses, and the predicted shoaling of MLD in response to future climate forcing drives a corresponding (

 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C52" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]. The change in MLD and reduction in water mass volume is also linked to the total outcropping area of water masses [
 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]. The outcropping regions of SAMW and AAIW are reduced by around 10%, with these losses being replaced by increased outcropping regions of subtropical water and CDW. The poleward shift of the subtropical gyres and water outcrop region is consistent with this change [
