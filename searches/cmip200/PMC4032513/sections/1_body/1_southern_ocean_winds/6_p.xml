<p class="p">Some inter-model variability may partially be explained by the difference in stratospheric resolution between models, with some having ‘high tops’ and others ‘low tops’ that do not fully resolve the stratosphere (
 <xref rid="RSTA20130296TB1" ref-type="table" class="xref">table 1</xref>). Some correlation does exist between stronger jet position responses to climate forcing and those models that resolve the stratosphere, possibly linked to upper-troposphere tropical warming, but this correlation does not extend to jet strength [
