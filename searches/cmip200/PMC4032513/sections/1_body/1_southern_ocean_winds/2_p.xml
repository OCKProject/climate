<p class="p">The Southern Ocean circulation is directly influenced by the momentum transfer of the strong westerly winds that exist over the ACC and by the easterly winds closer to the Antarctic continent. Both the ACC isopycnal gradient, and therefore its zonal circulation, and MOC have strong wind-forced components, although the exact coupling between wind and buoyancy effects is difficult to disentangle. Winds also directly influence mixed layer depths, vertical Ekman pumping and sea surface temperature, and therefore impact on oceanic carbon and oxygen uptake and storage. It is therefore critical that these winds are modelled accurately in order to assess the response of the Southern Ocean to predicted climate forcing.</p>
