<p class="p">Under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, there is a clear trend in westerly winds towards stronger and more poleward jets, with a directly associated positive trend in the SAM [
 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. This proceeds in three broad phases: an increase in strength and poleward shift in the late twentieth century, a weaker change over the first half of the twenty-first century and then a clear poleward shift and strengthening winds in the latter half of the twenty-first century. The plateau at the start of the twenty-first century is probably due to the recovery of the Austral summer ozone hole counteracting carbon forcing during this period [
 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. This shows that the inclusion of ozone forcing has had a measurable impact on wind stress [
 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>], although, in terms of position and jet strength, this effect is most pronounced in weaker RCP scenarios; and under RCP8.5, the effect of ozone recovery on jet position is almost negligible relative to GHG forcing [
 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. The annular component of the SAM is relatively well re-created in CMIP5, with spatial correlation coefficients between observations and an ensemble of 12 CMIP5 models generally being larger than 0.85, which also represents an improvement over CMIP3 [
 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. While the zonal mean structure of the SAM is in agreement with observations, the non-annular components are less well represented. This is particularly the case for the cyclonic circulation north of West Antarctica, where the core longitude varies between models by up to 90Â° and causes considerable variability to climate over the Antarctic Peninsula [
