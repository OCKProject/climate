<p class="p">Under the HIST scenario between 1985 and 2004, for the multi-model mean of 29 CMIP5 models, the peak strength of the westerly wind jet is biased 3.3±1.9° equatorward relative to reanalysis products, with no ensemble members peaking south of the observed position (

 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. This bias is most pronounced in the Indian and Pacific basins, but is also large and positive (1.4°) over the Atlantic. The bias tends to be smaller in atmosphere-only runs of a subset of the same models, suggesting that coupled atmosphere–ocean feedbacks may be partially contributing to this error, but more specific causes are not yet apparent. The jet peak strengths tend also to be biased low (−0.4±1.0 m s
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) relative to reanalyses, although there is more inter-model variability and biases tend to be positive (0.3±1.0 m s
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) in the Atlantic and strongly negative (−1.4±1.0 m s
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) in the Pacific sectors. It is worth noting that, while there is some uncertainty in the accuracy of reanalysis datasets, the variability between three reanalysis products compared by Bracegirdle

 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>] was negligible in comparison with inter-model differences, even taking into account the fact that the reanalysis-derived uncertainty is probably slightly smaller than actual observational uncertainties [
