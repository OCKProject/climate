<p class="p">The Southern Ocean MOC may be divided into two component cells that oppose each other to produce a residual, net, overturning [
 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. The Eulerian circulation is principally wind-driven and moves water equatorward in the Ekman layer, tilting up isopycnals in the process, and returns it at depth supported by geostrophic pressure gradients below the shallowest topography. This is opposed by an eddy-driven circulation, parametrized in CMIP5 models as some form of GM transport, that fluxes thickness downgradient to reduce isopycnal tilt. The residual circulation is extremely difficult to observe, and assessing the modelled eddy circulation requires the output of either product terms (e.g.

 </inline-formula>) or high-temporal-resolution velocity and tracer fields. Unfortunately, these were not required variables in CMIP5 and so cannot be readily assessed. The zonal mean overturning circulation was an output variable, although with a low priority of 3, and so only a handful of groups made these data available. A study of eight models found that there is a large range of both Eulerian and eddy cell transports for both the upper and lower overturning cells, with differences of over 200% between the weakest and strongest eddy contributions in the lower cell [
 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C52" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]. The upper cell residual circulation is similar to observational inverse estimates (15 Sv, [
 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]), whereas the lower cell tends to be stronger than observed. The small sample size and large inter-model variability make accurate assessment difficult, but this residual circulation is generally consistent with water mass budgets based on larger numbers of CMIP5 models (§4
