<p class="p">Under RCP8.5, the wind-driven upper cell increases in strength by up to 20% in proportional response to the general strengthening of the wind stress maxima, while the lower cell weakens by 10–60% by the end of the twenty-first century [
 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C52" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]. Eddy compensation of these changes occurs in both upper and lower cells but is only partial and varies significantly between models. This results in a net strengthening of the upper cell and weakening of the lower, which is qualitatively consistent with water mass budget analysis [
 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]. In their analysis of four CMIP5 models, Downes &amp; Hogg [
 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C52" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>] find that the MOC changes are most consistently related to wind stress change, but the small sample size makes the response to changed surface buoyancy fluxes uncertain. These results are broadly consistent with the examination of the Eulerian MOC in CMIP3 models where the Deacon cell spins up and its maximum shifts uniformly in response to stronger and more poleward westerly winds, whereas the bottom water cell is reduced in strength by around 2 Sv [
 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. It is difficult to assess the impact that improved eddy parametrizations has had on the MOC as eddy circulation statistics were not available in CMIP3.
