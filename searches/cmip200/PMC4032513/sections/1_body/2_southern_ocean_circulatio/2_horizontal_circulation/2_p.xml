<p class="p">Improvements have been made over CMIP3 in re-creating both the mean path and strength of the ACC. Improved topographic constraints due to better-resolved bottom topography largely ensure that the mean latitude of the ACC core lies within one degree (0.06±1.27°) of the observed ACC core in CMIP5 models in the HIST scenario between 1976 and 2005 [

Regional variability from the observed mean position is generally relatively small, and the equatorward bias seen in the western Atlantic in CMIP3 has largely been corrected in CMIP5, although the ACC core still tends to be biased equatorwards in the eastern Pacific. In CMIP3, there was found to be a strong and statistically significant correlation between the position of the ACC and the position of the zonal wind stress maxima [

 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. This relationship does not appear in CMIP5, where for an ensemble of 22 models there is no significant correlation between the position of the ACC and either the strength or position of the westerly wind stress maxima in the HIST scenario.
