<p class="p">The change in the width of the ACC through movement of its southern boundary will not necessarily reduce baroclinic transport, however, if the mean meridional density difference remains constant. A number of other processes may therefore be contributing to the observed inter-model transport variability. Increased 
 <italic class="italic">Îº</italic> will reduce isopycnal tilt over mid-depths in the ACC, suggesting that, if the ACC northern and southern boundaries narrow, increased isopycnal gradients may be reduced by enhanced GM transport, depending on the eddy parametrization implemented in each model [
 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. Changes in wind stress curl and associated Ekman pumping may also modify isopycnal slopes, and, owing to the stronger vertical stratification north of the ACC, changes in pumping here may be more effective in modifying ACC transport than south of the current [
 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. Despite this, Ekman pumping does not appear to directly modify transport in CMIP3, but rather it is the buoyancy fluxes of heat and freshwater in the upwelling and downwelling regions north and south of the ACC that most strongly correlate with transport [
