<p class="p">Under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 forcing scenarios, the ACC change over 2000–2099 in CMIP5 is largely similar to that seen in CMIP3, with a few notable differences. In CMIP5, there is no clear relationship between the coherent wind stress changes (§2) and either the transport or mean latitude of the ACC. There are significant changes in individual models, but no coherence across the ensemble (−2.7±9.8 Sv and 0.01±0.44°, respectively, for RCP8.5 [
 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]). This is perhaps unsurprising, as, although non-eddy-resolving ACC models have been shown to respond strongly to increases in wind forcing in idealized experiments [
 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>], the wind stress change under future climate forcing is significantly smaller (order 10%) than the multiple factors applied in such experiments. In CMIP3, there was also no correlation between ACC transport and wind stress [
 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>], but the ACC position was much more variable than in CMIP5 and moved in response to the position of the westerly wind stress maxima, in some cases by up to 4° [
 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Why this does not occur in CMIP5 is presently uncertain but may be due to increased topographic pinning by better-resolved bathymetry.
