<p class="p">The volume transport through the Drake Passage is the focus of many observational studies (134–164 Sv [
 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]), but it was poorly re-created in CMIP3, with an extremely large range of values (33–337 Sv, mean 144.6±74.1 Sv, for a 19 model ensemble) [
 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. CMIP5 still has a significant range (90–263 Sv across 23 models [
 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]), but they are tending to converge (mean 155±51 Sv), with only three models greater than 200 Sv. There has been relatively little change in surface wind stress strength or position (§2), so this improvement must reflect some other model change. One such candidate may be the broad implementation of more sophisticated Gent–McWilliams [
 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>] (GM) eddy parametrization schemes. In CMIP3, there was a strong relationship between the ACC transport and the eddy-induced thickness diffusivity (

 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. These simpler schemes are almost entirely replaced in CMIP5 with more complex parametrizations where the diffusion coefficient is itself a function of the density field, such as the Visbeck parametrization [
 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. The 
 <italic class="italic">κ</italic> value may range by up to two orders of magnitude between models (
 <xref rid="RSTA20130296TB1" ref-type="table" class="xref">table 1</xref>) and vary in space and time. As well as improving the parametrizations themselves, a realization of the generally poor model performance in the ACC in CMIP3 also probably prompted a greater focus on tuning these parametrizations for more accurate transports. The increase in model resolution and therefore bathymetry is also likely to have contributed to the improved ACC transport in CMIP5, although no models have yet increased resolution to the extent that eddy dynamics are represented, and no resolution dependence for ACC position or strength is apparent [
