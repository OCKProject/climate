<p class="p">The Southern Ocean was the focus of much attention in CMIP3 owing to its important role in the global climate system and because it is the site of one of the largest observed climate trends. The strong positive Southern Annular Mode (SAM) trend [
 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>] has been linked to greenhouse and ozone forcing [
 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>] and has led to a poleward shift and strengthening of the mid-latitude westerly wind jet. This, in turn, has been linked to oceanic changes in ACC frontal positions [
 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>] and water mass property changes [
 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. Results from CMIP3 indicate that the wind trend will be continued into the twenty-first century [
 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>] and that there is an associated poleward shift of the ACC, along with general warming of the upper ocean, a freshening of intermediate layers [
 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>] and an intensification of the upper MOC [
 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. The oceanic warming is associated with a reduction in SIE [
 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] and consequent slowdown of Antarctic bottom water (AABW) formation close to the continent [
 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Despite these consistent trends, CMIP3 also produced a number of inconclusive results, and demonstrated a worryingly wide inter-model spread of ACC and MOC strengths and water mass characteristics and distribution, particularly for Antarctic intermediate water (AAIW). The CMIP3 models also failed to reproduce the observed expansion of SIE over the altimetric record [
 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] and did a generally poor job of reproducing its distribution or total extent. Russell [
 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>] found that only one of 18 models assessed was not deficient in at least one area of Southern Ocean simulation.
