<p class="p">The output of up to 61 CMIP5 models and hundreds of variables has been generally available for almost 2 years now and enough publications on the representation of various aspects of the Southern Ocean in CMIP5 under climate forcing have emerged to begin to form a coherent assessment of the state of the art in coupled climate modelling for this region. This review seeks to summarize the findings of these studies and draw them together to provide an overview of the representation of the present-day Southern Ocean, how it is projected to change under climate forcing scenarios and how this has changed relative to CMIP3. These studies all examine the output of the historical (HIST) scenario that aims to re-create present-day climate with observed forcing between 1850 and 2005. Most also examine the representative concentration pathway (RCP) future scenarios that specify concentration and emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) from 2006 to 2300, although most studies focus on end of twenty-first century changes. A full range of anthropogenic climate drivers are included in the RCP scenarios (GHGs, aerosols, chemically active gases and land use) along with a repeating 11-year solar cycle [
