<p class="p">The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) is an international collaborative effort to develop such coupled climate model simulations within a coordinated experimental framework. It aims to provide a multi-model suite of projections of the Earth's climate under a number of specified anthropogenic forcing scenarios in order to assess climate response, gauge its predictability, identify feedback cycles and understand the factors that drive differences between models [

 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. CMIP5 improves on CMIP3 in a number of areas: significantly improved spatial resolution in both atmosphere and ocean (although the ocean remains too coarse to permit mesoscale eddies), a larger proportion of full Earth system models (ESMs) resolving biogeochemical cycles, the inclusion of atmospheric ozone in all models and more complete atmospheric chemistry, and a dramatically expanded list of available ocean, atmosphere and cryosphere variables. These improvements mean that over 100 times more data are archived (more than 3 PB) and have been made available from CMIP5 relative to CMIP3 [
