<p class="p">This review first examines the Southern Ocean wind stress forcing as it relates to the ocean and sea ice (§2), followed by the dynamical representation of the ACC and MOC (§3) and the Southern Ocean bulk properties and thermodynamics in §4. It concludes with an examination of the representation of sea ice and the subpolar regime (§5) and a discussion of the system as a whole, what questions remain open and approaches to future research (§6). A representative sample of the CMIP5 models most often examined in the studies reviewed here is given in

 <xref rid="RSTA20130296TB1" ref-type="table" class="xref">table 1</xref> are some of the key model methodologies, treatments of the ocean or atmosphere, and parametrizations pertinent to the Southern Ocean, such as ocean and atmosphere resolution, ocean vertical grid type, the resolution of the stratosphere, etc. The relative impact of these inter-model differences can be hard to disentangle owing to the number of other factors that also vary between models. For example, some authors [

 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>] could find no clear ocean resolution dependence for ACC transport or core latitude, and similarly no obvious differences between full ESMs and those that did not include explicit carbon cycles. In other cases, however, model set-up was found to have a significant impact on the representation of the Southern Ocean. These are discussed more fully in the relevant sections in the following.
