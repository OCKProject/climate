<p class="p">The Southern Ocean is the site of a climatically important interface between the ocean interior, the atmosphere and the cryosphere. In this vast region, the combination of strong surface fluxes of heat and freshwater, along with powerful and persistent westerly winds, act to tilt isopycnals meridionally. This density gradient drives the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) and provides a low-resistance pathway from the deep ocean to the surface that allows the upwelling, surface transformation and subsequent subduction of the large volumes of water that form the southern limb of the global Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC).</p>
