<p class="p">The ACC and MOC are complex emergent features of the ocean circulation controlled by the balance between wind momentum input, the buoyancy gradient between the warm subtropical and cold subpolar gyres, topographic form stress and steering, and fine-scale eddy transport and mixing [

 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Adding to the complexity, the exchange between the surface and interior ocean is mediated by the surface mixed layer, which itself responds to seasonal buoyancy forcing, wind stress, lateral mixing and upwelling [
 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>], as well as isopycnal [
 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>] and diapycnal mixing [
 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>] and wind-driven pumping in the ocean interior. The system is complicated further by the presence of Antarctica to the south, with its massive ice-sheet freshwater reservoir and seasonal sea-ice extent (SIE). Although much progress has been made in recent years towards understanding the interplay of these factors through vastly increased numbers of high-quality observations [
 <xref rid="RSTA20130296C8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>] and concerted modelling efforts, the response of the system to projected anthropogenic climate forcing still has a great deal of uncertainty. One way of addressing this uncertainty is through the use of large numbers of climate models and looking for robust trends to emerge across the ensemble.
