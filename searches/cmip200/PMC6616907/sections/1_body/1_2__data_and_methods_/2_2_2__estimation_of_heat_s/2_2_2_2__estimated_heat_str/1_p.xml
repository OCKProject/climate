   <p class="p">Secondly, to estimate the space pattern of heat-stress change. We used 14 ESMs from the CMIP5 archives. These models have different levels of climate sensitivity [
    <xref rid="B30-ijerph-16-02202" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>] and represent a wide range of climate responses to emission scenarios. 
    <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijerph-16-02202" class="xref">Supplementary Table S2</xref> summarizes information regarding the 14 ESMs used in this study. All model data were interpolated to a common 1.5° × 1.5° horizontal grid. The spatial pattern of the heat stress in response to each scenario was identified using a time-slice approach, where the spatial state at a specific warming point related to

The spatial simulations of future heat-stress change were based on the CMIP5 models ensemble and the 5–95th percentile confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated from 10,000 bootstrapped subsamples of data. The period of 1980–2010 was referred to as the present-day baseline and the preindustrial period was defined as 1861–1900.

   <p class="p">Lastly, to evaluate population exposure to extreme heat stress. We used the population data from socioeconomic development scenarios of SSPs [

    <bold class="bold">×</bold> 1.5° latitude/longitude grid to match the GCM resolution. The population exposed to an extreme wet-bulb temperature was calculated at a daily time resolution. If the wet-bulb temperature at a given grid cell exceeded the threshold value on a given day (for example, a wet-bulb temperature of 32 °C or 30 °C), then the grid cell was considered to be exposed, and the total number of exposed cells was counted in units of person-days. The total amount of annual exposure (in units of person-days) is the number of people multiplied by time. The uncertainty of the population exposure value is calculated by taking the 5–95th percentile confidence intervals of 14 GCMs (to reduce the influence of predicted temperature outliers in several GCMs).
