<p class="p">The global targets of the 2 °C and 1.5 °C scenarios are based on the assumption that global mean warming to this century end would be limited to well below 2 °C or 1.5 °C. These are idealized global scenarios and they are presented in the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) Assessment Report 5 and the 1.5 °C Assessment Report [

 <xref rid="B19-ijerph-16-02202" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>], respectively. The 1.5 °C or 2.0 °C warming condition is defined by projections in which the 9-year smoothed temperature reaches 1.5 °C or 2.0 °C warming relative to the preindustrial level in each climate model. A total of 46 simulations is used for 1.5 °C warming and 42 simulations for 2 °C warming. The multi-model ensemble mean is calculated for 1.5 °C and 2 °C.
