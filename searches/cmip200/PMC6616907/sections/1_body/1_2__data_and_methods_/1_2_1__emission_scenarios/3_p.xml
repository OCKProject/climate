<p class="p">The INDCs pledges were submitted by 192 countries. The national INDC pledge has been continuously updated. This study analyzed 165 national INDC pledges submitted as of May 2019, in which the European Union (EU) member states submitted an INDC pledge for the entire region. The INDC pledge of each country may be found on the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) website [

The emission targets of countries range from absolute values to relative values of the baseline year level or the emission reduction targets relative to the baseline year level. We analyzed and extracted each country’s emission targets. The annual global emissions pathways were obtained using a linear interpolation between the last historical year and committed years (the 2030 year). For the post-2030 period, annual emission pathways were obtained by extending the continued action of emission reduction under INDC scenarios (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02202-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref> is referred as the “delayed action” scenarios, and the scenarios are emission projections that assume that the INDC mitigation action delayed or stalled after 2030 and return to a no-policy trajectory. The third and fourth groups (III, IV) are referred as the extended “continuous action” (INDC commitment) scenario, and the scenarios are based on the assumption that the national INDC actions of emission reduction will continue to the late 21st century and global emissions will decline steadily. The relatively constant decarbonization rates were followed for the period after 2030.
