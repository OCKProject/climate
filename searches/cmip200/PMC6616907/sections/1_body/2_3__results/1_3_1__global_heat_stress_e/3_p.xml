<p class="p">Those regions severely affected by heat stress have different climate and weather patterns during different heat wave events in different scenarios, which could affect the relative importance between temperature and humidity (on the extreme wet-bulb temperature). In some regions, both high temperature and humidity contribute to high wet-bulb temperatures, such as eastern China, South Asia, and the Amazon. Under the delayed and continuous mitigation scenarios, the 30-year average humidity (2070–2100) in these regions increases of 0.25–0.44% and 0.14–0.24%, respectively, compared with the current level and are, respectively, 0.16–0.3% and 0.06–0.11% greater compared with the 2 °C global target scenario. In some regions, the contribution of temperature far exceeds that of humidity, such as West Asia, Australia, and the Sahara. The maximum temperature of these regions may reach 51–53 °C (higher than those in East China, South Asia, and the Amazon) under the continuous mitigation scenario, but the annual humidity is far below that in East China, South Asia, and the Amazon. Therefore, although West Asia, Australia, and the Sahara could experience significant heat-stress effects, they are not as intense as that in East China, South Asia, and the Amazon.</p>
