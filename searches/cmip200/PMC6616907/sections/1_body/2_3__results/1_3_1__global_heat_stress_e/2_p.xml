<p class="p">These projected increases in wet-bulb temperature are predominantly concentrated in some regions. In the delayed mitigation scenario, some regions are particularly vulnerable to heat stress, such as eastern China, South Asia, West Asia, the Amazon, South America, West Africa, the eastern United States, and northern Australia. Among them, South Asia (~34 °C, the highest of all GCMs), East China (the highest of ~33 °C), and South America (the highest of ~33 °C) are the most prominent regions, all of which will exceed their respective historical maximum wet-bulb temperatures. In the INDC continuous mitigation scenario, the heat stress intensity in these hotspot areas is significantly reduced and the average values for these areas are about 1–2 °C. Under the global targets of the 1.5 °C and 2 °C scenarios, the effects of extremely high heat stress can be largely avoided in regions such as West Asia, Australia, and the eastern United States and most models predict that the wet-bulb temperature remains below 29 °C in approximately all regions of the world.</p>
