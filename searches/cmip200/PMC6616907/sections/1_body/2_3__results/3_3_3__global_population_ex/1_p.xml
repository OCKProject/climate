<p class="p">Large population growth is expected throughout the 21st century, especially in developing countries. Most of this increase is expected to occur in areas with high wet-bulb temperatures, leading to a significant increase in exposure to dangerous high-temperature conditions. For the period 2070â€“2100 (30-year average), we used SSP population prediction data to estimate the number of person-days (the number of days and number of people superimposed) exposed to high wet-bulb temperatures (
