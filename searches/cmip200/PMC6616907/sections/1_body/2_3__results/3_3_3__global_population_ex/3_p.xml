For the period 2070–2100, South Asia (India) is the area with the greatest population size exposed to the 30 °C wet-bulb temperature (approximately 3 × 10

 <sup class="sup">10</sup> person-days for the INDC scenarios), followed by East China, West Asia, Saudi Arabia, West Africa (Ghana, Côte d’Ivoire, etc.), the eastern United States, Brazil, and northern Australia. In the 1.5 °C and 2 °C global target scenarios, the population exposure in each country is significantly reduced by one to three orders of magnitude. For example, India’s exposure is approximately 4 × 10
