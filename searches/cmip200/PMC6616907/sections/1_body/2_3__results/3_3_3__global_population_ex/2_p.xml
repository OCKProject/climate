<p class="p">The population exposed to extreme wet-bulb temperatures is largely determined by future greenhouse gas emissions. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02202-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>a shows the annual exposure predicted by the 14 GCMs (wet-bulb temperature range of 30–35 °C) under the delayed and continuous mitigation scenarios and the 1.5 °C and 2 °C global target scenarios. In the wet-bulb temperature range of 30–33 °C, the population exposure differs significantly between the INDC scenarios and the 1.5 °C and 2 °C global target scenarios by several orders of magnitude (person-days). The population exposed to wet-bulb temperatures over 30 °C and 32 °C under the INDC continuous mitigation scenario (compared to the delayed mitigation scenario) decreases by approximately one order of magnitude; however, compared with the 1.5 °C and 2 °C global target scenarios, exposure increases by half and one order of magnitude (wet-bulb temperatures of 30 °C and 32 °C, respectively). Wet-bulb temperatures of 34 °C and 35 °C are very rare, and only individual models have simulation results.
