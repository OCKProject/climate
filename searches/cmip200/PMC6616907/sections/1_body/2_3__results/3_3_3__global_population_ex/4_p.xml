<p class="p">Compared with populations of different regions exposed to wet-bulb temperatures of 30 °C, the populations of different regions exposed to 32 °C is significantly less (there is approximately one or two orders of magnitude decrease in each region). The region with the largest population exposure is India (for the INDC scenarios, exposure is approximately 5.2 × 10
