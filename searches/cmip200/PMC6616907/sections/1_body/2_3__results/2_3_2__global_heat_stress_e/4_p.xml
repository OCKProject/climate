<p class="p">In South Asia, especially in India and Pakistan (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02202-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>i,j), heat-stress exposure time is the longest (compared to the previous two regions). For the period 2070–2100, the number of days whose wet-bulb temperature may exceed 30 °C and might be 4 to 30 days per year (under the delayed mitigation scenario) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02202-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>k), whereas that along the India-Pakistan border and India’s eastern coast may reach 40 days (several models predict 60 days). This is related to the high humidity caused by the large local agricultural land area and the high irrigation level. Under the INDC continuous mitigation scenario, the number of days with heat stress each year is reduced to 1 to 18 days, and predictions of some highly sensitive models may also reach 60 days. In terms of the total exposure time, the wet-bulb temperature may exceed 30 °C at 400 hours per year, under the delayed mitigation scenario, or over 100 hours, under the INDC continuous mitigation scenario (

Although continuous mitigation efforts (compared to the delayed mitigation scenario) can significantly shorten the days and hours of heat exposure in India, it may still lead to some heat-exposure risks. Only under the 1.5 °C global target scenario can the heat exposure risk in India be reduced to its lowest level.
