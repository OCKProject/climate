 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02202-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>e,f), for the 30-year average of the period 2070–2100, the number of days whose wet-bulb temperature may exceed 30 °C might be 1 to 10 days per year (under the delayed mitigation scenario) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02202-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>g). Under the INDC continuous mitigation scenario, the number of days with heat stress each year is greatly reduced. The median values simulated by modeling continuous mitigation efforts is comparable to that under the 1.5 °C and 2 °C global target scenarios; in other words, the INDC continuous mitigation efforts may play an important role in the reduction of heat stress in the Amazon region.
