<p class="p">The duration of heat exposure is critical to determining its effects on health, as any potential respiratory disease response is associated with prolonged heat exposure. To assess the exposure time of the wet-bulb temperature at the regional scale, we predicted the number of days whose wet-bulb temperature may exceed the threshold (the dangerous days, which may have a severe impact on human labor productivity) every year. We selected three regions that are most severely affected by heat stress for analysis.</p>
