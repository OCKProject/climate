<p class="p">In East China (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02202-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>a,b), for the period 2070–2100, the number of days whose wet-bulb temperature may exceed 30 °C may be 5 to 20 days per year for most areas (under the delayed mitigation scenario) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02202-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>c), whereas it might be 15 to 50 days in North China area, which is related to the high humidity caused by irrigation in North China [
 <xref rid="B32-ijerph-16-02202" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. Under the INDC continuous mitigation scenario, the number of days with heat stress is reduced to 1 to 5 days per year, and only the prediction of some sensitive models (such as CanESM2) reaches 25 to 30 days. In terms of the total hours of exposure (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02202-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>d), the number of hours whose wet-bulb temperature may exceed 30 °C might be 45–150 hours per year (under the delayed mitigation scenario) and 5–25 hours (under the INDC continuous mitigation scenario). Compared with the delayed mitigation scenario, continuous mitigation efforts can significantly shorten the number of days and hours of heat exposure in North China; however, compared with the 1.5 °C and 2 °C global target scenarios, continuous mitigation efforts may still lead to certain heat exposure risks. Under the 1.5 °C and 2 °C global target scenarios, the heat exposure risk in North China is low.
