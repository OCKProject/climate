<p class="p">In addition, we also predicted the number of days whose wet-bulb temperature may exceed the threshold (which may have an extremely severe impact on human life) every year. Many studies have suggested that temperatures exceeding 32 °C could have a harmful effect on resting people (resting without labor) [

For the period 2070–2100, in India, the number of days whose wet-bulb temperature might exceed 32 °C might be several days to several tens of days per year (under the delayed mitigation scenario); however, under the INDC continuous mitigation scenario, the number of days with a temperature over 32 °C is significantly reduced by one order of magnitude. Compared to India, China and the Amazon have less number of days with temperatures over 32 °C per year under the delayed mitigation scenario (less than one order of magnitude) (
