<p class="p">Indoor experiments have shown that the wet-bulb temperature of 32 °C is an upper threshold for many people participating in normal outdoor activities. Many people collapse before reaching the wet-bulb temperature of 32 °C or any temperature close to that level. This level is rarely reached anywhere today. However, our study shows that by the end of the 21st century, if mitigation efforts slow, some regions (the Amazon, West Asia, eastern China) may experience up to ten days or more per year at this level. South Asia’s exposure could amount to more than 30 days per year, and hundreds of millions of people worldwide would suffer as a result. If mitigation actions steadily progress, some underdeveloped, densely populated areas might avoid the worst impact. Although such weather conditions might not directly kill people or stop all activities, farm labor or other outdoor activities under such circumstances could lead to chronic kidney disease and other harmful health effects. Certainly, low-latitude regions would suffer the greatest losses.</p>
