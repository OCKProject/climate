<p class="p">Previously, when studying the human health risks of heat waves, only a few studies focused on the humidity issues associated with climate change. However, humidity may prove a breaking point for some areas as the temperature rises. As global temperatures increase, the atmosphere can accommodate more water vapor, which can greatly amplify the influence of heat. Generally, humid heat is more oppressive than “dry” heat for humans. This is because humans cool their bodies through sweating and evaporation from the skin into the air; when the air is already full of water, evaporation from skin slows, eventually becoming impossible. Therefore, the combined changes in both the temperature and humidity pose a major threat to human health. Similar threats would also affect other animals and vegetations. For instance, heat stress may affect directly and indirectly dairy cows’ metabolic and physiological acclimation. This may reduce the synthesis of milk and makes dairy cows more susceptible to illness [
