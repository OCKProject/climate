<p class="p">This study used the global climate models ensemble to predict the wet-bulb temperature (depending on the combination of heat and humidity) under various mitigation efforts presented in the Paris Agreement, to reflect the impact of different mitigation efforts. The study found that for the period 2070–2100, under the delayed mitigation scenario, many areas of the world (e.g., East China, India-Pakistan border area, West Asia, the Amazon, West Africa, the eastern United States, northern Australia) may be exposed to high heat stress. The heat stress temperature in the most severe areas might reach 34 °C. If countries can maintain their mitigation commitments and steadily implement mitigation efforts, then the heat stress intensity in these hotspot areas will be significantly reduced. If mitigation efforts can further achieve the 2 °C global temperature control goal, then extreme heat stress in West Asia, Australia, the eastern United States, and other regions can possibly be avoided, and the duration of extreme heat stress can be shortened in those regions where extreme heat stress is inevitable (e.g., India). We believe that hotspot regions affected by heat stresses could greatly benefit from enhanced global mitigation efforts because these regions have few cooling facilities, weak adaptability and are areas with the highest population density.</p>
