<p class="p">Increasingly more studies use heat stress as a human health risk indicator. The frequency of these events may increase the most in low-latitude and mid-latitude regions in the future [
 <xref rid="B17-ijerph-16-02202" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. In this paper, the 14 generalized circulation models (GCMs) from the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) were used to perform the global analysis of population exposure to extreme wet-bulb temperature under the multi-emission scenarios presented in the Paris Agreement (the INDC (Intended Nationally Determined Contribution) emission reduction scenario and global temperature control scenarios, 1.5 째C and 2 째C). This analysis also integrates with population predictions from SSPs (shared socioeconomic pathways). We calculated the changes in daily air temperature, humidity, and wet-bulb temperature caused by various emission scenarios of the Paris Agreement and evaluated the risk differences in heat stress between the INDC emission reduction scenario and the global temperature control scenarios (1.5 째C and 2 째C).
