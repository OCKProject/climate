<p class="p">Human health is affected by temperature and humidity. The human body can effectively dissipate heat through evaporative cooling even under high-temperature conditions, if the moisture level is low. However, in hot and humid conditions, the efficiency of evaporative cooling slows, and the body may not be able to maintain one stable core temperature. The body may accumulate heat and suffer from fever [

The heat stress index, the wet bulb temperature (also abbreviated as Tw), can be used to measure the potential impact of heat on the human body. It captures the comprehensive effects of air temperature and humidity on the heat exchange between the environment and human body. Over the past four decades, the wet bulb temperature has been shown to increase with temperature and humidity changes [
