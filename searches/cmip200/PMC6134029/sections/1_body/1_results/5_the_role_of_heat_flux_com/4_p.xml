Furthermore, we expect the overly strong ocean-only evaporative response to temperature (without the counteracting known precipitation SST response) to result in a substantially overestimated upwards freshwater flux response to SST biases. These unrealistic feedbacks could at least in part explain the need for sea surface salinity restoring towards observational estimates in ocean-only models.
