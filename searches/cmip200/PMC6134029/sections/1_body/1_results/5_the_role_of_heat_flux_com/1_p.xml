<p id="Par40" class="p">To link AMIP5 net flux and associated CMIP5 SST biases to deficiencies in AMIP5 atmospheric model characteristics we also consider regression analyses of individual heat flux component area-mean biases for 40–60°S. AMIP5 surface net flux biases depend on their biases in individual flux components, which in turn depend on their biases in other atmospheric column parameters. For example, AMIP5 net surface downward short-wave biases have been shown to be strongly linked to biases in cloud characteristics, e.g. particularly deficiencies in simulated cloud amount and brightness

 </sup>. By contrast, the AMIP5 net downward long-wave biases are expected to be strongly influenced by simulated cloud base height, cloud base temperature, and moisture errors. AMIP5 sensible and latent heat flux biases are expected to depend on the representation of numerous atmospheric parameters, including boundary layer characteristics.
