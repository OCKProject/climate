<p id="Par41" class="p">AMIP5 net flux biases are strongly correlated with AMIP5 short-wave and total radiative flux biases (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.91 and 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.87, respectively, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). AMIP5 net flux biases are anti-correlated with their long-wave biases (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = −0.61) because long-wave biases are anti-correlated with the mostly larger short-wave biases (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = −0.81; Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). AMIP5 net flux biases are weakly correlated with turbulent flux biases (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.35). Short-wave bias variations across the models are therefore the dominant driver of variations in AMIP5 net flux biases, mainly because short-wave inter-model variations are largest (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>; Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref>). As expected, the correlation of CMIP5 SST biases on AMIP5 short-wave flux biases is also much stronger (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.73) than those on AMIP5 long-wave flux biases and AMIP5 total turbulent flux biases (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = −0.44 and 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.27, respectively). Hence, local AMIP5 short wave bias variations linked to cloud representation errors are the dominant driver of the AMIP5 net flux bias variations, which in turn appear to be the main driver CMIP5 SST bias variations.
