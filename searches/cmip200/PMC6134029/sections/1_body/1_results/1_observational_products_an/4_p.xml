<p id="Par10" class="p">It is important to emphasize that our regression correlations and slope results are not affected by any observational errors (since for each parameter the observational error will be identical across all the models). Correlations (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>), regression slopes (
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>) and 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> values (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>) relate the variations in one parameter to those of another and are therefore independent of any reference employed. Values for our AMIP5/CMIP5 bias analyses would therefore be identical if we were to use different observational products to estimate biases; any individual model as a reference; or the actual parameters rather than estimated parameter biases. We do not interpret regression intercepts (which do depend on the observational errors). To indicate structural errors common to all models in regression figures we plot the estimated multi-model mean parameter biases together with their observational uncertainty.
