<p id="Par8" class="p">We estimate multi-annual mean AMIP5/CMIP5 biases by subtracting observational estimates from the corresponding simulated quantities. Estimates of individual AMIP5/CMIP5 model biases include a contribution from observational errors. Since accurate quantitative observational error estimates are not currently available for our regional and temporal averages we derive basic indicative error estimates from differences between products (see Methods). Observational uncertainty estimates are quoted whenever observational errors could influence results. Overall, however, estimated observational errors are generally smaller than the substantial model biases, providing confidence in our inferences.</p>
