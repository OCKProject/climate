<p id="Par9" class="p">For linear regression analyses, unless otherwise stated, we consider area-weighted biases for the Southern Ocean 40–60°S region for 18 consistent AMIP5/CMIP5 models (see Methods and Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref> for model details). Most correlation values are presented together with regression analysis slopes in brackets or tables. We therefore generally adopt the terminology ‘a correlation of Y on X’ simply to indicate the direction of the associated regression analysis (although the correlation value is between X and Y).
