<p id="Par45" class="p">We first investigate coupled wind feedbacks using regression analyses of biases in AMIP5/CMIP5 near surface (10â€‰m) zonal wind maximum latitude (ZWML) on biases in AMIP5 net flux and CMIP5 SST. ZWML biases are expected to influence ocean thermal structure well below the mixed layer via Ekman pumping caused by wind stress curl

 </sup>. We also expect biases in atmospheric model net flux, and associated coupled ZWML biases, to adversely influence simulated heat (and carbon) uptake under climate forcing (since vertical heat transports depend on both stratification and Ekman pumping). In climate model projections, the position of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current core, which is in geostrophic balance with ocean thermal structure, is also often correlated with the latitude of the wind stress maximum over decadal timescales
