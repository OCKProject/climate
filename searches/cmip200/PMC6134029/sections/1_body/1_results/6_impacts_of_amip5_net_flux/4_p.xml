<p id="Par48" class="p">The impact of atmospheric model net flux biases, and associated wind feedbacks, on ocean thermal structure is also investigated by comparing CMIP5 temperature composites over models exhibiting high (HIF, 7 models) and near zero or low (NZF, 7 models) AMIP5 downward net flux biases. HIF is significantly warmer than NZF in the upper 1500 m north of ~ 58°S (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). There is also an apparent north-south dipole in thermal structure difference extending to 3000 m; with cooler waters to the south of ~ 58°S and warmer waters to the north for HIF (these models tend to have higher 40–60°S SST and more poleward ZWML). Differences below 1500 m are not statistically significant (possibly due to relatively small composite sizes). This deep dipole pattern is, however, broadly consistent with the observed change in thermal structure linked to the poleward wind migration associated with the Southern Annular Mode increase over recent decades
