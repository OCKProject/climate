 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = −0.44), indicating that the internal atmospheric dynamical link is much weaker. CMIP5 ZWML biases are more strongly anti-correlated with CMIP5 SST biases (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = −0.85). Hence, the dynamical link between CMIP5 ZWML biases and AMIP5 net flux biases must primarily arise through the impact of atmospheric net fluxes on evolving coupled SST, which in turn feeds back onto ZWML and SST. Previously, this link has been identified solely within CMIP5, which precluded clear attribution to atmospheric model net flux errors
