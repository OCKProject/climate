<p id="Par28" class="p">This conceptual case model is useful since it provides simple relationships which only involve the terms we know. In this model, stand-alone atmospheric model errors must be balanced by an opposing surface flux response so the coupled flux biases are small. We will discuss the validity of the assumptions in this model compared to those in the general case model when we compare their expectations with the AMIP5/CMIP5 ensemble regression results (in the Methods we also consider three alternative simple conceptual models in which different pairs of terms on the right hand side of Eq.Â
