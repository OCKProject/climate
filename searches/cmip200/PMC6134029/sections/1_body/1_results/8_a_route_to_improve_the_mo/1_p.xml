<p id="Par51" class="p">Over a succession of Hadley Centre climate models (HadCM3-A, HadGEM1-A, HadGEM2-A, HadGEM3-GC2-A to HadGEM3-GC3.1-A; see Methods), involving over 20 years of model development, estimated stand-alone atmospheric model TAFB have generally decreased for more recent configurations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>; Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). An exception is HadGEM1 that had small long-wave biases due to cancellation between cloud height and cloud amount, highlighting that TAFB is not a comprehensive metric of model fidelity. However, from HadCM3-A to HadGEM3-GC2-A estimated net flux biases generally appear to have increased. In combination, we interpret these findings as evidence for the progressive removal of cancelling errors through improved process-representation (this is an example of how improving models can often initially make key biases worse). Subsequently, in-depth process evaluation and targeted development for HadGEM3-GC3.1-A over several years has considerably reduced both the estimated net flux bias and estimated TAFB simultaneously compared to HadGEM3-GC2.
