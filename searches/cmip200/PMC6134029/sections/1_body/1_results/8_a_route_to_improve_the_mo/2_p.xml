This represents additional evidence to support our inference that Southern Ocean coupled SST biases are caused by local atmospheric model cloud-related surface flux biases. An ongoing effort to improve future configurations of HadGEM3 is focussed on improving the representation of cloud phase, particularly super-cooled liquid
