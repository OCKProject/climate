 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). It is surprising that a characteristic of stand-alone atmospheric models with prescribed SST should be so closely associated with SST biases in coupled models spun up for many hundreds of years. To interpret this interesting result we derive and apply novel equilibrium mixed layer heat budget theory over the next three subsections. In the first subsection, by making a series of assumptions, we derive two simple analytical models of differing complexity (a consistent but more complete theoretical model with fewer assumptions is discussed in several extended theory subsections in the Methods). In the next subsection the expectations from these analytical models are compared with statistical analyses of the AMIP5/CMIP5 ensemble. In a third subsection, to link the AMIP5 net flux and CMIP5 SST biases to cloud process-representation deficiencies in the AMIP5 stand-alone atmospheric models we analyse their correlations on AMIP5/CMIP5 individual heat flux component biases.
