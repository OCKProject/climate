 </sup>, which suggest that inter-model Southern Ocean SST bias variations are related to variations in the strength of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). We also find an extremely weak correlation of −0.07 between Southern Ocean 40–60°S area-mean SST and AMOC strength across 13 coupled CMIP5 models.
