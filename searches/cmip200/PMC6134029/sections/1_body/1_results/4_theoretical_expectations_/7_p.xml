<p id="Par38" class="p">The apparently small (&lt;~30%) fraction of CMIP5 SST bias variance explained by ocean model C bias variance is a surprising result, particularly given that we find that in the HadGEM3 models (see Methods) SST biases are sensitive to ocean model resolution and parameters. For example, the change in SST bias from HadGEM3-GC2 to HadGEM3-GC3.1 appears to include a contribution from ocean model changes (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>). Note, however, that this small fraction is for this set of models, and includes the impact of any enhancement of component model F and C bias variances by outlying models (see Methods for details) and any under-sampling of component model F and C bias variances due to common-structural errors (the 
 <italic class="italic">λ</italic>
 <sub class="sub">F</sub> and 
 <italic class="italic">λ</italic>
 <sub class="sub">C</sub> estimates could also be sensitive to the choice of models). Small multi-model mean AMIP5 net flux and CMIP5 SST biases (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>) suggest that under-sampling of component model errors is not dominant for this region and set of models, despite known structural errors, e.g. underestimated cloud brightness

However, this would require that CMIP5 coupled SST bias variations also be driven by an important mechanism which happened to also be correlated with AMIP5 stand-alone atmospheric model F biases which we do not expect or find any evidence of (see Methods).
