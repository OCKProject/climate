<p id="Par50" class="p">Many models with small net flux biases do not appear to have small estimated TAFB (Fig.

 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>), which could be expected to result from errors in cloud amount, thickness and/or brightness caused by deficiencies in parameterised cloud microphysics, particularly for mixed phase cloud. For coupled models, it is to some degree possible to adjust regional SST or net TOA flux by tuning parameter values, particularly in cloud microphysics
