<p id="Par49" class="p">Across AMIP5, considerable inter-model variations are evident in all individual heat flux component biases (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>; Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">5</xref>). We term the sum of the absolute value of area-mean short-wave, long-wave and turbulent flux biases for each model the ‘Total Absolute Flux Bias’, TAFB. (i.e. TAFB = |short-wave bias| + |long-wave bias| + |turbulent flux bias|). The simulated response of net surface flux to climate forcing arises from the sum of the individual heat flux component responses, which depends on the fidelity of their present day magnitudes. TAFB provides a first order metric of the overall fidelity of their present day simulation. Achieving a small net flux bias with a small TAFB would therefore increase confidence in a model’s coupled net flux response (i.e. ‘right for the right reasons’).
