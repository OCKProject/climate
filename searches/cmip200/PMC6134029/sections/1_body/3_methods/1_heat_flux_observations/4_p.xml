 </sup>. Assimilated observations constrain reanalysis column energy storage tendencies and divergences more than they constrain their surface heat flux components (substantial simulated TOA and surface short-wave flux biases tend to also cancel, at least partially, in the energy divergences). This is evidenced (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>) by the considerable reduction in the spread in zonal mean net surface fluxes estimated using our method (&lt;~10 Wm

 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>
 </sup> compared to the spread in their directly simulated zonal mean net downward surface fluxes (&gt;~40 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>). We use net downward surface short-wave and long-wave radiation flux component estimates from CERES-EBAF (version 2.7)
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>
 </sup>. We then estimate the total turbulent flux as a residual at each grid point by subtracting CERES-EBAF derived net surface downwards total radiative flux from our net flux estimate. As discussed, this approach is adopted since the spread in observational estimates of turbulent fluxes is considerably larger than the spread between observational estimates of radiative heat fluxes
