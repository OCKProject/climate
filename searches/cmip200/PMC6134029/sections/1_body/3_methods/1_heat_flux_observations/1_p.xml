<p id="Par59" class="p">For all our observational heat flux component estimates, an averaging period of 2001â€“2007 inclusive was used to permit inter-comparison between available radiative and turbulent flux product climatologies over their consistent overlapping period. All surface heat fluxes presented are net downward fluxes.</p>
