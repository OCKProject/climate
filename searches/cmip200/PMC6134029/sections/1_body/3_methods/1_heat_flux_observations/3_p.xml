<p id="Par61" class="p">This approach is adopted since there are considerable and poorly quantified uncertainties in the observational estimates of the heat flux components, due to the scarcity of observations for ocean regions of near-surface atmospheric humidity, air temperature and winds; and direct estimates of heat fluxes

 </sup>. Errors accumulate in net flux estimates since relatively small net fluxes are comprised of large seasonally-reversing net fluxes, which are in turn estimated from large opposing radiative and turbulent heat flux components. As a result, observations often yield unrealistic large absolute global mean surface net flux values, when radiative and turbulent heat flux products are added together, hindering their use for the assessment of models
