<p id="Par78" class="p">Zonal mean ocean temperature was calculated using the ocean potential temperature variable from the CMIP5 archive. Models with suitable diagnostics from the coupled historical climate simulation experiment (HIST) were evaluated. Zonal mean temperatures were calculated over the ‘HIST’ period 1979–2005 for each model. Of the models available, there were seven within the AMIP5 ‘high flux bias’ (&gt;5 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>) composite termed HIF (‘CCSM4′,’bcc-csm1-1-m’,’CNRM-CM5′,’GISS-E2-R’, ‘ACCESS1.3′, ‘ACCESS1-0′ and ‘HadGEM2-CC’) and seven in the AMIP5 ‘near zero or low flux bias’ (&lt;2.5 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>) composite termed NZF (IPSL-CM5A-MR, IPSL-CM5A-LR, CanESM2, MPI-ESM-LR, CMCC-CM, NorESM1-M and CSIRO-Mk3-6-0). Only the IPSL models have large negative net flux biases. Each model’s zonal mean was interpolated onto a common regular one degree latitude, seventy depth level grid (mean vertical spacing ~100 m). The models in each ensemble were then averaged together and the resulting HIF and NZF composites differenced to produce latitude-depth temperature difference fields. A paired 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>-test was conducted at each grid cell of the composites to assess if the mean of the elements of the two composites were significantly different from one another at the 95% level (making the assumption that the models are independent, which may not strictly be true). Those found to be significant were stippled in Fig.
