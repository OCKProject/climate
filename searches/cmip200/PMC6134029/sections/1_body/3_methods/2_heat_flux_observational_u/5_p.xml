 </sup>. We therefore obtain an approximate estimate for the TAFB error by simulating 10,000 random samples of model flux component biases drawn from independent normal distributions with means and standard deviations given by those of our AMIP5 bias estimates (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). We similarly assume observational errors are independent and normally distributed with standard deviations given by the above observational heat flux component standard error estimates and zero means i.e. we ignore any structural errors. This method suggests the random standard error in TAFB is ~8 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>. The modelled TAFB error distribution also suggests that our TAFB estimates may on average be biased low by ~3 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>. To maintain consistency between our heat flux component bias estimates and our TAFB estimates we do not apply this bias correction in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref> or Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>. Since the same 3 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> offset would be applied to all the models and uncertainty box in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>, correcting this bias would not in any way change our inferences. This 8 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> uncertainty in the 40–60°S area-mean TAFB estimate is substantial and could be worsened by unquantifiable structural errors. Hence, our TAFB results should be interpreted with some caution. However, it should be noted that this uncertainty of ~ 8 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> is considerably smaller than the spread in area-mean TAFB across the models of ~ 50 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>, suggesting that we should be able to robustly separate good from poor TAFB models.
