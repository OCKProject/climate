However, the quoted estimates are for a single annual mean rather than a 2001–2007 mean; are based on CERES prior to energy balance adjusted fluxes (EBAF) bias corrections; and apply to any 20° latitude area mean (not 40–60°S) so could potentially be influenced by larger uncertainties in other regions. Our longer 2001–2007 averaging period would reduce random errors compared to CERES annual error estimates. If errors are correlated then error cancellation will occur when these components are combined (e.g. if cloud amount is over-estimated, net downward short-wave will be less positive and net downward long-wave will be less negative)
