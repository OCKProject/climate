<p id="Par68" class="p">A summary of the area-mean flux component observational uncertainties is presented in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>, together with the AMIP5 estimated bias means and standard deviations, and Hadley Centre model biases. Note that the same observational error will apply to all models so relative changes between models are independent of observational errors. For AMIP5 net flux, short-wave flux and TAFB, the observational uncertainties are generally considerably smaller than the mostly substantial model biases (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>; Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">5</xref>). There appear to be improvements in 40–60°S area-mean fluxes between HadGEM3-GC2 and HadGEM3-GC3.1 for net flux, short wave, turbulent flux and TAFB given the estimated observational errors. For the zonal mean bias estimates in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>, at most latitudes there appear to have been improvements between HadGEM3-GC2 and HadGEM3-GC3.1 for net flux and short-wave and TAFB. Note, however, that turbulent and long-wave flux zonal mean bias estimates for both HadGEM3-GC2 and HadGEM3-GC3.1 are within the observational uncertainty, so these differences should be interpreted as changes rather than improvements.
