<p id="Par136" class="p">The four conceptual cases have different expected signatures across the model ensemble for each of these four regression relationships. All four cases ignore remote and indirect contributions to the coupled response terms that do not depend on local SST (i.e. we assume ∆

The expected results for the R1 to R4 regressions for each of the cases are detailed below, together with their agreement with the AMIP5/CMIP5 ensemble results.
