<p id="Par133" class="p">This subsection considers three additional simplified conceptual solutions to Eqs. 
 <xref rid="Equ2" ref-type="" class="xref">1b</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Equ3" ref-type="" class="xref">2</xref> in which either or both of the ocean terms are assumed to be dominant. We contrast the expectations from these models with those from the simplified conceptual case model introduced in the main manuscript in which the ocean terms are assumed to be small. We demonstrate that our AMIP5/CMIP5 ensemble Southern Ocean 40–60°S regression results are inconsistent with the expectations from these new cases but are broadly consistent with the case when ocean terms are assumed small. Note however, that it is possible that these alternative simplified conceptual cases might be consistent with AMIP5/CMIP5 ensemble results for other regions.
