  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70" class="xref">70</xref>

 </sup>. Heat content biases are expressed as layer mean temperatures. These simulations were taken from the historical runs and averaged over the period 1985–2005 and compared to EN4 averaged over the same period. For the additional Hadley Centre models SST biases were also estimated by subtracting the 1985–2004 EN4 mean. For HadCM3
