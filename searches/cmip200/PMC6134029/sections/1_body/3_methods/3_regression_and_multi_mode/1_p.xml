<p id="Par70" class="p">For linear regression analyses we employ the terminology ‘a regression of 
 <italic class="italic">Y</italic> on 
 <italic class="italic">X</italic>’ to refer to evaluating 
 <italic class="italic">Y</italic> as a linear function 
 <italic class="italic">of X</italic> plus errors. Since we generally quote correlation together with the regression analysis slope we adopt the same terminology for correlation, i.e. we refer to ‘a correlation of 
 <italic class="italic">Y</italic> on 
 <italic class="italic">X</italic>’ simply to indicate the direction of the associated regressions analysis (although correlation values are between 
 <italic class="italic">X</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Y</italic>). Errors in our observational estimates only influence the regression intercept values which we do not use. Regression slope uncertainty estimates are one standard error. Note, however, that these uncertainty estimates may not be reliable since they assume that the regression analysis residuals are normally distributed. For all linear regression analyses, it should be noted that the correlations and fractions of explained variance include any cross-correlations of both parameters with other variables. We present two-sided 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> values (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>) for the significance of the slopes of the linear fits with a null hypothesis that the slope is zero.
