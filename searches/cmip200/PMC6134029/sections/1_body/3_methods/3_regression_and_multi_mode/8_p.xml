 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>). The southern hemisphere mid-latitude zonal wind maximum latitude (ZWML) was defined as the latitude of the maximum in the climatological annual zonal mean 10 m westerly wind component between 30°S and 70°S (southern hemisphere latitudes are defined as negative). Zonal mean westerly winds on the native model grids were interpolated onto a regular latitude grid with 0.075° spacing using a cubic spline interpolation to estimate the latitude of the zonal mean westerly wind maximum. Climatologies were defined over the period 1979–2005, which is the period of overlap with the modern satellite era, during which atmospheric reanalysis datasets are most reliable. We defined the bias in jet position relative to the ERA-Interim re-analysis

 </sup> over the same 1979–2005 period (positive ZWML bias is northward). It should be noted that the ERA-Interim re-analysis winds are constrained by the assimilation of atmospheric wind, pressure, temperature and humidity observational estimates. A basic estimate of the observational uncertainty in ZWML of 0.15° is derived from the difference between ZWML estimates from the ERA-INTERIM and MERRA
