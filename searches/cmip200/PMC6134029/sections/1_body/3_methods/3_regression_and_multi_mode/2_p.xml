<p id="Par71" class="p">Simulated surface heat fluxes were analysed from 28 AMIP5 and 18 CMIP5 model experiments with suitable diagnostics and several recent Hadley Centre model simulations (see Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>). For AMIP5 and CMIP5, temporal averages over a common simulation period for all models of 1981–2005 inclusive were undertaken. Due to their different run periods, the Hadley Centre stand-alone atmospheric models (consistent with those employed in the coupled models) were averaged over the periods 1978–1995 for HadCM3-A
