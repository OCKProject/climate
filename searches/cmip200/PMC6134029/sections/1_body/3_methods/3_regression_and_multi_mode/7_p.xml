 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>), a linear regression was undertaken between SST and the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) strength at its latitudinal maximum using a 70 year mean from the pre-industrial control simulations corresponding to years 1–70 of 1% CO
