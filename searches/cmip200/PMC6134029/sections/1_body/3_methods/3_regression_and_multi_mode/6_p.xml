<p id="Par75" class="p">The CMIP5 and AMIP5 experiments provided an overlapping subset of 18 models for which we had both coupled and atmosphere-only ocean temperature and surface heat flux component diagnostics (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>). Note that for historical simulations with Earth System Models observational estimates of greenhouse gas concentrations are prescribed. However, there may be some land-use differences compared to physical climate model simulations since land-use is simulated. Since there is no known justification for the exclusion of any of the models we chose to include all 18 models for which atmospheric heat flux components and ocean temperatures were available. However, note that the choice of models has an impact both on our correlation and regression analyses and the multi-model mean estimated biases (for details see the theoretical dependence of Δ
