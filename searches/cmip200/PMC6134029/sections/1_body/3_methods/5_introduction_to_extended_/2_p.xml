<p id="Par80" class="p">First, we derive the equations governing a more complete analytical model, which includes the coupled response residual terms that do not depend linearly on local temperature. We then apply the more complete theory in four subsections corresponding to the R1 to R4 AMIP5/CMIP5 regression analysis relationships. The theoretical dependence of Δ

 <sub class="sub">O</sub> and weak cross-correlations, and on the impacts of excluding outlying models. Next, we assess our equilibrium assumption and discuss the time-varying equations. Finally, we present three alternative simplified conceptual models to the one presented in the main manuscript and show that they are inconsistent with our AMIP5/CMIP5 ensemble results.
