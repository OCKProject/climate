 <sub class="sub">A</sub> correlation (and could also affect the

 <sub class="sub">F</sub> and

 <sub class="sub">C</sub> estimates). We chose to include all 18 models for which atmospheric heat flux components and ocean temperatures were available. There is no known justification for the exclusion of any of the models. Note, however, that the available models included two IPSL models, both of which had low net flux and SST biases compared to the other models. Their inclusion increases the 
 <italic class="italic">∆T</italic> on Δ
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">A</sub> correlation. For example, for AMIP5 net flux vs. CMIP5 SST linear regressions, the correlations (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> value) were 0.84 (1.4E-5), 0.77(2.7E-4) and 0.70 (2.6E-3) including both, one (IPSL-CM5A-MR) and no IPSL models, respectively. Hence, without the two IPSL models the fraction of SST bias variance explained by atmospheric model F biases reduces to around 50%. Spearman rank correlations are less sensitive to outliers than linear regressions. For AMIP5 net flux vs. CMIP5 SST regressions, the Spearman rank correlations (and 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> values) were 0.83 (2.4E-05), 0.80 (1.3E-4) and 0.76 (7.1E-4) including both, one (IPSL-CM5A-MR) and no IPSL models, respectively.
