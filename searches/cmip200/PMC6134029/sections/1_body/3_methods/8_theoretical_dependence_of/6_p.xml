<p id="Par109" class="p">Cross-correlations between both regression parameters and other important parameters can influence regression results, complicating inferences on causality. Our analysis considers the linear dependence of CMIP5 SST biases, a coupled ocean parameter, on AMIP5 net flux biases, a parameter from a stand-alone atmospheric model with no ocean model. Hence, any causality can only result from a dependence of CMIP5 SST on AMIP5 surface fluxes, not vice-versa. Clearly, we expect AMIP5 net flux biases to be correlated with all AMIP5 atmospheric model deficiencies that directly influence surface fluxes, e.g. cloud or boundary layer parameter biases. These biases would therefore influence SST biases through our proposed mechanism. Potentially misleading cross-correlation candidates are limited to any local or remote atmospheric model variables that influence AMIP5 surface heat, freshwater and momentum fluxes. Any such cross-correlation would only matter if these flux biases were to strongly influence area-mean CMIP5 SST biases through a different mechanism, e.g. such as by changing the coupled response term ΔC
