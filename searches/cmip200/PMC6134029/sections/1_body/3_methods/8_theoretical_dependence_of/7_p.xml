<p id="Par110" class="p">Local 40–60°S area-mean correlations of AMIP5 net fluxes on AMIP5 precipitation minus evaporation freshwater and AMIP5 momentum fluxes are weak for our set of AMIP5/CMIP5 models (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> &lt; 0.2, 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 17). Furthermore, their weak correlations with SST (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> &lt; 0.2, 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 17) do not exceed those expected solely from their cross-correlation with net flux via our proposed mechanism. There is also no significant correlation between these fields and the regression residuals from the SST bias on net flux bias regression, i.e. there is no evidence of an independent physical link with SST. Note also that no significant correlation is evident for SST biases on sea surface salinity biases for 40–60°S. Clearly, we cannot rule out all potential non-local cross-correlations between heat, momentum and freshwater flux bias terms and 40–60°S heat flux biases. However, there is no physical basis to expect these remote terms to play an important physical role in the 40–60°S area-mean mixed layer heat budget.
