 <sub class="sub">A</sub> and Δ
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>
 <sub class="sub">O</sub> variations across the models to be approximately independent since the stand-alone ocean and atmosphere models are separate models, which are largely developed independently. In fact, any tuning that might be undertaken once components are coupled to minimise local SST biases could, from Eq. 
 <xref rid="Equ19" ref-type="" class="xref">M11</xref>, even be expected to introduce weak anti-correlation between Δ
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">A</sub> and Δ
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>
 <sub class="sub">O</sub>. If significant, this anti-correlation would have reduced both our 
 <italic class="italic">∆T</italic> on 
 <italic class="italic">∆F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">A</sub> correlation and the total of the sum of the variance in 
 <italic class="italic">∆T</italic> explained by Δ
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">A</sub> and Δ
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>
 <sub class="sub">O</sub> individually to less than one. Taking such an anti-correlation into account  would make our estimate of 30% for the fraction of 
 <italic class="italic">∆T</italic> variance explained by Δ
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>
 <sub class="sub">O</sub> even smaller.  Anti-correlation would also reduce the magnitude of the regression slope, which would in turn increase the magnitude of our estimates of (
 <italic class="italic">λ</italic>
 <sub class="sub">F</sub> + 
 <italic class="italic">λ</italic>
 <sub class="sub">C</sub>). Since 
 <italic class="italic">λ</italic>
 <sub class="sub">F</sub> is estimated separately from R1 this would mean that our estimate of 
 <italic class="italic">λ</italic>
 <sub class="sub">C</sub>, which assumes no correlation, is an overestimate. Note, however, that this effect cannot be large, given that our 
 <italic class="italic">∆T</italic> on Δ
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">A</sub> correlation coefficient is 0.84, i.e. fairly close to 1.0.
