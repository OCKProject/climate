 <italic class="italic">C</italic>
 <sub class="sub">R</sub> (like Δ
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">R</sub>) is associated with local and non-local adjustments to oceanic and atmospheric states that result when model components are coupled from all of the model component errors, including AMIP5 surface momentum/freshwater forcing biases. Strictly, it should be noted that it is possible to have error cancellation within the Δ
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>
 <sub class="sub">R</sub> term. For example, the coupled ocean response to atmosphere-only biases in momentum or freshwater fluxes could be compensated by other coupled adjustments. We are not able to estimate Δ

 <sub class="sub">O</sub> for any CMIP5 model so we are also unable to estimate Δ
