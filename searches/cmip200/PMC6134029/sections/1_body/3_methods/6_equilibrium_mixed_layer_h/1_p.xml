<p id="Par81" class="p">We can use the ocean mixed layer heat budget to derive an analytical solution for the equilibrium mixed layer temperature bias in any coupled model at any location as a function of the biases in the total heat fluxes into the mixed layer in stand-alone component atmospheric and ocean models (given suitable surface boundary conditions). Since SST is closely linked to mixed layer temperature, we assume they are approximately equal.</p>
