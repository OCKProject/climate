 </sup> uses stand-alone ocean-ice models, with prescribed best-estimate surface atmospheric forcing. In these models, obviously there can be no atmospheric adjustment to flux changes associated with SST biases. In principle, it might prove possible in the future to derive first order estimates of Δ

However, this requires further investigation and, unfortunately, there are currently insufficient (&lt;10) OMIP experiments with consistent ocean components to those of the CMIP5 models to undertake regression analyses. Furthermore, for OMIP5, the assumption of realistic surface forcing might prove to be invalid, given large known errors in ocean forcing sets and questionable surface boundary condition assumptions.
