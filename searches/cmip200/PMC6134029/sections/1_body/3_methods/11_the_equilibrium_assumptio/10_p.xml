<p id="Par130" class="p">We can apply this theory to investigate the time-evolution of the HadGEM3-GC2 SST biases. For approximate area-mean equilibration to occur most of the 40–60°S region must equilibrate, including any areas with particularly deep mixed layers. We therefore use the maximum annual mean mixed layer depth at any grid point within the 40–60°S region of 1000 m. As we do not know |
