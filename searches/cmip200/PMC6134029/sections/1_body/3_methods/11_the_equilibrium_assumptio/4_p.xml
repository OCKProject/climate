 <italic class="italic">H</italic>/d
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>) from any multi-model mean simulated response to climate forcing common to all the models should have no impact. We expect the remainder of the simulated heat content tendency d
 <italic class="italic">H</italic>/d
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> to vary approximately randomly across the models since it is should be primarily associated with climate variability. The validity of our equilibrium assumption therefore depends on the size of d

 <italic class="italic">t</italic> variations across the models relative to those of the known bias terms, i.e. ∆

 <xref rid="Equ26" ref-type="" class="xref">M18</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Equ9" ref-type="" class="xref">M3a</xref>. This will depend on the averaging period with longer averaging period tending to have smaller magnitude heat content tendencies.
