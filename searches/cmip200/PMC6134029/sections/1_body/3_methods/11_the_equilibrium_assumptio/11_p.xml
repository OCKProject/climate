<p id="Par131" class="p">In HadGEM2-GC2 present day control runs the Southern Ocean 40–60°S annual mean SST bias evolves over time with an e-folding timescale of around 8 years, asymptoting over around 20 years to a fairly stable mean value of around ~ 3 °C. The bias then persists for the remainder of the experiment (in this case ~ 200 years) with some smaller inter-annual fluctuations of less than approximately 1 K super-imposed. The simulated HadGEM3-GC2 e-folding time scale of ~ 8 years is therefore broadly consistent with our rather uncertain and crude theoretical estimate of equilibration timescales of ~ 13 years.</p>
