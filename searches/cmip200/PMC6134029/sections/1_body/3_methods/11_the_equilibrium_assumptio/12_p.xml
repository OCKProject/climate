<p id="Par132" class="p">The Southern Ocean SST bias is evident at a wide range of forecast timescales across all of the systems in the Met Office traceable seamless forecasting suite which employ the HadGEM3-GC2 model. This includes forecasts of a few days from the coupled Numerical Weather Prediction system; forecasts of months to years from Seasonal and Decadal forecasting systems; and forecasts of many centuries in centennial climate prediction experiments

 </sup>. This basic theory provides a potentially useful framework to try to link certain biases in coupled numerical weather prediction or seasonal/decadal forecasting systems to equilibrated biases in long term climate simulations for models. Of course, this would only be useful for model regions where the bias evolves as a negative exponential which asymptotes towards a long term value such as the Southern Ocean

 </sup>. Note, however, that for many model regions the time evolution of the bias in seasonal/decadal forecast is considerably more complicated
