The surface flux responses to SST biases reduce the inter-model variations in coupled model net flux biases compared to those in the stand-alone atmospheric models. However, erroneous supplies of heat and moisture to the coupled atmosphere persist through compensation of atmospheric model short-wave biases by coupled turbulent and long-wave flux feedbacks. This could contribute to causing known coupled model atmosphere biases in temperature, wind, heat transport, and Top-Of-Atmosphere (TOA) energy fluxes

 </sup>. For example, AMIP5 net flux biases, and associated CMIP5 SST biases, appear to be linked with biases in the latitude of the CMIP5 zonal mean eastward wind maximum, together adversely influencing sub-surface ocean thermal structure.
