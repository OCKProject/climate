<p id="Par54" class="p">For the Southern Ocean 40–60°S region evidence from an interpretive framework combining the theory with regression analyses across this AMIP5/CMIP5 ensemble suggests that CMIP5 coupled climate model SST bias variations are primarily caused by stand-alone atmospheric model net flux bias variations. These atmospheric model net flux bias variations are mainly associated with variations in short-wave radiation biases, which have previously been linked to cloud-representation deficiencies

 </sup>. This provides strong new evidence for a causal link between clouds, radiation, SSTs, and atmospheric circulation over the Southern Ocean.
