<p id="Par53" class="p">Novel mixed layer heat budget theory with simplifying assumptions predicts that coupled model SST biases arise through the mixed layer equilibration process, which primarily involves coupled responses in local surface heat flux, 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>, and combined horizontal and vertical ocean heat transport convergence, 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>, which are linearly related to local SST biases. SST biases depend on the sum of the local stand-alone atmospheric model F and ocean model C biases, divided by the sum of the local F and C coupled SST response sensitivity constants. This means that models could have small SST biases by having too large C and F sensitivities to SST even if stand-alone component model errors were large (and vice-versa).
