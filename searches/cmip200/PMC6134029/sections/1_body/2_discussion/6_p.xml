<p id="Par58" class="p">In future, this methodology could prove useful in interpreting the causes of coupled SST biases in other regions, particularly those where correlations between CMIP5 SST biases and AMIP5 net flux biases are strong (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">4</xref>). Similar approaches could also be employed to interpret causes of other coupled model parameter biases. Ultimately, this could help to constrain uncertainties in climate projections by identifying physical relationships between observable present day biases and uncertain aspects of the simulated climate responses, i.e. provide emergent constraints.
