<p id="Par56" class="p">The conclusions summarised above do not depend on the accuracy of our observational products. Aiming to limit observational errors in our bias estimates for individual atmospheric AMIP5 models we employ a novel method to estimate observational heat flux components. Most AMIP5 models with small net flux biases appear to achieve this through considerable error cancellation between heat flux components. Improved cloud process-representation over successive Hadley Centre models has demonstrated an apparent route to improve the representation of heat flux components in stand-alone atmospheric models and reduce error cancellation. This has considerably improved SST biases in HadGEM3-GC3.1 the Hadley Centre CMIP6 model. Our estimates of uncertainties in our observational products, although unavoidably basic, are generally considerably smaller than the substantial model biases, providing confidence in these inferences.</p>
