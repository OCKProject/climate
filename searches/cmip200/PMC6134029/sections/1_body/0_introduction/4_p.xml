<p id="Par6" class="p">The AMIP5/CMIP5 ensemble results, in combination with theoretical expectations, suggest that AMIP5 surface net flux bias variations are the dominant cause of variations in CMIP5 SST biases. The main cause of AMIP5 net flux bias variations is found to be short-wave radiation bias variations, which are known to be related to cloud deficiencies

 </sup>. AMIP5 net flux and associated CMIP5 SST bias variations are also shown to impact on wind feedbacks and ocean thermal structure. Most AMIP5 models with small net flux biases appear to achieve this by error cancellation between flux components. Considerable improvements in atmospheric model surface flux component fidelity and coupled model SST biases in more recent Hadley Centre models demonstrate a route to improve coupled climate models.
