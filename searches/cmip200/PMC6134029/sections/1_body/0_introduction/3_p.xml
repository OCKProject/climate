 </sup> model biases are combined within a theoretical framework. The AMIP5 experiment uses the same atmospheric models employed in coupled CMIP5 simulations, but with a prescribed lower boundary condition of observed SST

 </sup>. In AMIP5, the atmospheric state and surface heat fluxes are not influenced by coupled feedbacks caused by SST biases. Analysing CMIP5 and AMIP5 in combination therefore allows us to separate the influences of atmospheric model errors and coupled feedbacks, which were not separable in previous analyses that examined only CMIP5 simulations

 </sup>. Equilibrium mixed layer heat budget theory is used to predict relationships between coupled model SST biases and atmospheric/coupled model net surface flux biases. The same relationships are then evaluated using linear regression analyses across the AMIP5/CMIP5 ensemble for the Southern Ocean 40–60°S region, followed by similar analyses for individual surface heat flux component biases. The impacts of AMIP5 net flux and CMIP5 SST biases on CMIP5 coupled model wind and ocean thermal structure biases are also investigated. Finally, new observational estimates are employed to investigate estimated simulated heat flux component biases for AMIP5 and a hierarchy of Hadley Centre atmospheric models, spanning over 20 years of model development.
