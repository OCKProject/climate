  <p class="p">Relationship between estimated net flux biases and estimated total absolute flux biases for the AMIP5 and Hadley Centre atmospheric models. Multi-model means for all AMIP5 models (AMIP5 MEAN ALL) and for the subset of 18 AMIP5 models with CMIP5 SST (AMIP5 MEAN SUBS) are also included. The Hadley Centre models are labelled with dark blue symbols and connected in order of release date by a solid dark blue line. Note that these model bias estimates include a contribution from observational errors. Our indicative observational uncertainty estimates of 8 Wm
   <sup class="sup">−2</sup> for TAFB and 3 Wm
   <sup class="sup">−2</sup> for net flux (see Methods) are represented by crosses centred on each model symbol. A box enclosing all the model symbols within our estimated observational uncertainties is also marked with a dashed black line. The region where TAFB is less than net flux bias is shaded in grey since estimated TAFB must be equal to or larger than estimated net flux bias
