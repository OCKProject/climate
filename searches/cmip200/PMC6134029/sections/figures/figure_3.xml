  <p class="p">Linear regression of estimated biases in the latitude of the CMIP5 maximum zonal mean 10 m westerly wind on the estimated 40–60°S AMIP5 net flux biases. Zonal wind maximum latitude (ZWML) biases are relative to ERA Interim with positive values indicating northward biases. Our observational product uncertainty estimates are ~ 3 Wm
   <sup class="sup">−2</sup> for net flux bias and ~ 0.2° for ZWML (see Methods). Observational product errors do not affect the regression slope, correlation or 
   <italic class="italic">p</italic> values. However, the position of points for individual models and regression intercepts do include a contribution from observational error. The multi-model mean values are labelled with a solid black circle with a cross through it representing their estimated observational uncertainties. The large multi-model mean CMIP5 ZWML bias but small multi-model mean AMIP5 net flux bias suggest that other common structural errors influence errors in CMIP5 ZWML for this set of models
