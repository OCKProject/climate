  <p class="p">Simulated ocean-area zonal mean coupled SST biases and stand-alone atmospheric model heat flux component biases for HadGEM3-GC3.1 and HadGEM3-GC2. (
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>) SST biases, (
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>) net downwards surface heat flux biases, (
   <bold class="bold">c</bold>) net downwards surface short-wave radiation flux biases, (
   <bold class="bold">d</bold>) net downwards long-wave radiation flux biases and 
   <bold class="bold">e</bold> total downwards turbulent heat flux biases for HadGEM3-GC2(-A) (blue) and HadGEM3-GC3.1(-A) (red). The AMIP5/CMIP5 multi-model mean (black line) and spread (grey shading) for the 18 consistent AMIP5/CMIP5 models (see Methods) are included on all panels. The HadGEM3-GC2 and HadGEM3-GC3.1 SST biases are for present day control runs for years 50 to 100. The maximum estimated zonal mean observational errors between 35 and 65°S for SST, net flux, short-wave flux, long-wave flux and turbulent flux are 0.3 K, 7 Wm
   <sup class="sup">−2</sup>, 3 Wm
   <sup class="sup">−2</sup>, 10 Wm
   <sup class="sup">−2</sup> and 14 Wm
   <sup class="sup">−2</sup>, respectively (see Methods). At most latitudes, there appear to have been improvements between HadGEM3-GC2 and HadGEM3-GC3.1 for SST, net flux and short wave, given these estimated observational errors. However, the HadGEM3-GC2 to HadGEM3-GC3.1 differences for estimated long-wave and total turbulent flux biases should be interpreted as changes not improvements (see Table 
   <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref> for equivalent 40–60°S area-mean results)
