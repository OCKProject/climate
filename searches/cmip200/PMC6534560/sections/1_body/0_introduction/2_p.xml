<p id="Par3" class="p">Furthermore, it is essential to understand how landfalling hurricanes along the U.S. East Coast may change in the future as greenhouse gas (GHG) forcing increases. While it is certain that SST will continue to rise as a result of GHG forcing, it is not clear how VWS may respond to GHG forcing along the coastal regions. Using the IPCC AR4 21
