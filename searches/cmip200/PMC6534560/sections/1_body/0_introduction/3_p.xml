 </sup>, in the presence of the background natural multidecadal variability. We address two related questions here: is the change over the past 70 years in hurricane PI and VWS along the U.S. East Coast dominated by anthropogenic forcing or natural multidecadal variability, and how would the future changes of these conditions impact hurricane intensity and formation in the region?
