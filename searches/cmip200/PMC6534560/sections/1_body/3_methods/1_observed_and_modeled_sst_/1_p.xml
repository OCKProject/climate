 </sup> and the model SST data are directly taken from the CMIP5 and CESM-LE monthly outputs. The vertical wind shear used in this study is computed from the difference in vector wind at 200 hPa minus that at 850 hPa for both observations and climate model outputs. For observations, VWS is computed as in Kossin

 </sup> from 1948 to 2015. The daily vertical wind shear was computed first and then averaged to get the monthly and seasonal mean VWS used in the analysis. For the CMIP5 models and the CESM-LE, VWS was computed from the monthly mean vector winds from the model output for each model ensemble member. The resulting monthly mean VWS are found to be relatively insensitive to whether one uses daily or monthly vector winds for the vertical shear calculation. The multi-model or multi-ensemble mean and spread are then obtained from the 27 CMIP5 simulations (see Supplementary Table
