<p id="Par9" class="p">The time when anthropogenically forced VWS may be strong enough to erode the natural AMV-induced dipole VWS pattern in the future is of particular interest, as the AMV dipole pattern provides a natural protection to the U.S. East Coast hurricane intensification during active MDR tropical cyclone epochs. Based on CMIP5 MMM, the anthropogenic forced VWS will reach a similar amplitude as that due to AMV by around 2050. However, the multi-model spread is large and thus the time of emergence differs widely from model to model. Using Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3c</xref>, the CESM-LE VWS change indicates that by 2020, the anthropogenic forced VWS will reach the same amplitude as that due to AMV, and by 2050, the forced VWS will be twice as strong as that associated with AMV. This suggests that anthropogenic forcing will substantially erode the natural protection of AMV to the U.S. East Coast hurricane activity by 2050. The AMV amplitude is relatively weak in the Gulf Coast region, thus anthropogenic forcing will not substantially change the natural variability of the hurricanes moving into that region. There, as shown earlier, the relative role of the increasing PI and enhanced VWS may cancel out some of the future changes in hurricane intensity and which factor may prevail is an interesting question to explore further. For the MDR region, where AMV amplitude is rather large, and the anthropogenic influence on PI and VWS also oppose each other, we expect that the natural variability of hurricane activity may continue to dominate into the future.
