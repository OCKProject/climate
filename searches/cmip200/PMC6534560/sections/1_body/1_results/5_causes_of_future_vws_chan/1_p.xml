 </sup>, and the related northward shift of the midlatitude jet stream in both the CMIP5 MMM and the CESM-LE. To determine the change in VWS due to contributions from the upper and lower levels, Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref> shows the wind vector differences between the two periods along with the climatological wind magnitude at 200 hPa and 850 hPa for CMIP5 MMM and CESM-LE. The northward shift of the jet is clearly seen at both the upper and lower levels and in the Atlantic and the Pacific regions. There is also a clear indication of a southward flow at the lower level and northward flow at the upper level, implying an enhanced and northward extended Hadley circulation, at least in the tropical North Atlantic. Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref> strongly suggests that not only the VWS decreases along the U.S. East Coast, but this is also the case for the East Coast of Asia, where one might expect that in the future typhoons would intensify more than in the historical climate and reach higher potential intensity values.
