 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b</xref> shows the CMIP5 MMM PI time series averaged for the same three geographic regions. There is a monotonic increase in PI for all three regions, but the increase is much faster for both the U.S. East Coast and the Gulf Coast compared to the MDR, consistent with Ting

 </sup>. For the PI, the multi-model spread is not as large as for VWS, showing a more robust SST warming in all models – the main driver of the PI change. The fast increase in PI along the U.S. East Coast, coupled with the more favorable wind shear environment for hurricane intensification there, suggests that hurricanes tracking toward the U.S. East Coast will have a better chance of achieving its PI in the future, which may be much stronger than what we’ve experienced in the past. For the Gulf Coast, the two effects, warmer SST and stronger wind shear, oppose each other. How future hurricane intensity may change there will depend on the relative influence of the two factors, leaving future projections of hurricane intensity along the Gulf Coast less certain.
