<p id="Par7" class="p">In the future, AMV modulation of the tropical cyclone activity as seen during the historical period should continue and the relative amplitude of the anthropogenically forced change and the AMV could help determine the projections of future hurricane activity. This relative relationship is illustrated in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a</xref> which shows the area averaged VWS for three geographical regions, the U.S. East Coast (25N–40N, 80W–60W), the Gulf Coast (20–30N, 95W–82W), and the MDR, for 1900 to 2100. The future anthropogenic emissions following both the rcp4.5 and rcp8.5 are included. The VWS associated with AMV is also indicated in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a</xref> which illustrates the amplitude range of VWS due to AMV. While the magnitude of the MMM VWS associated with anthropogenic forcing is largely within the natural variability for the historical period, the decrease in the U.S. East Coast VWS (increase in the Gulf Coast) starts to dominate over the AMV VWS in the second half of the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century. By the end of the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century, the forced VWS in the coastal regions is almost twice as strong as that associated with the positive or negative phases of AMV, making possible for hurricanes to intensify faster along the U.S. East Coast (slower along the Gulf Coast). In the MDR, the VWS associated with AMV is rather large, and the increase in forced VWS only starts to dominate at the end of the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> Century. The model spread of the VWS is fairly large, indicated by the light solid lines showing the 25th to 75th percentile of models’ values. But for the U.S. East Coast, the majority of the models indicate decreased VWS with magnitude ranging from +0.5 m/s to −2 m/s at the end of the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> Century. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3c</xref> shows the VWS change in the CESM-LE. The ensemble spread in the single model is clearly much smaller than the multi-model spread in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a</xref>, with magnitude ranging from −1.5 m/s to −2.5 m/s at the end of the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> Century. The VWS change in the CESM-LE is at the high end of the model spectrum as can be seen comparing Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a,c</xref>. The MDR VWS changes show the largest multi-model spread and a relatively small amplitude. The large spread in this case is not surprising, as the spatial pattern in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> indicates a nodal point of VWS change in the MDR. The Gulf Coast shows an increase in VWS with the multi-model magnitude ranging from −0.5 m/s to +2 m/s. In the CESM-LE, both the MDR and the Gulf Coast show a similar magnitude increase in VWS with an ensemble range from +1 m/s to +2 m/s.
