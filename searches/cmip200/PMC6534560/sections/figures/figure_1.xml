  <p class="p">Hurricane peak season (August, September, and October, ASO) vertical wind shear (VWS, left) and sea surface temperature (SST, right) regressed onto the radiatively forced (top) and AMV (bottom) indices as shown in Supplementary Fig. 
   <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>, with the forced component obtained through the Signal-to-Noise Maximizing EOF analysis PC1 from CMIP5 multi-models (see methods section). The winds and SST are taken from the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis and NOAA ERSST, respectively, for the period 1948 to 2015. Units are m/s per °C of SST index for VWS and °C per °C of SST index for SST. The stippling indicates statistical significance of the regression coefficients at the 5% level using 2-sided Student’s t-test.
