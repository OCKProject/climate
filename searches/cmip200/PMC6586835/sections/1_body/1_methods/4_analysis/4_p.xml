<p id="Par12" class="p">Due to the size of our dataset, we used Generalized Linear Mixed – Models (GLMMs), with the binomial family, to predict the impact of projected climate on hatching success. Specifically, we projected hatching success at nesting beaches within each state that presented significant relationship between climatic variables and hatching success (Praia do Forte (BA), Itaunas (ES), and Maria Rosa (RJ)) using the predictor variables indicated as having low AICc values and being significant in our GAMs (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). Emergence rate was not projected because it can be influenced by many other factors not included in this study (e.g., sand compaction, substrate type, etc.)
