 </sup>, which conducts daily patrols to monitor nesting activity at these beaches during the sea turtle nesting season (September to March), including nest location, lay date, hatch date, and hatchling production. Loggerhead nesting data from 2005 to 2014, across seventeen nesting grounds (BA = 10, ES = 5, RJ = 2), was incorporated in the study. A total of 17,428 nests were considered for this study (BA = 11,946, ES = 4,006, RJ = 1,476). Due to logistical and financial constraints, neither Espirito Santo nor Rio de Janeiro had consistent nesting data (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). The 2006–2007 nesting season in Rio de Janeiro had fewer than five reported nests in total, so that season was not included in the analyses. Nests from Sergipe, which represented 1.8% of nests for loggerhead turtles were not included in this study because the necessary climate data was not available for this state. We only considered 
 <italic class="italic">in situ</italic> nests that had data for hatching success (percentage of hatched eggs within a clutch) and emergence rate (number of hatchlings that emerged from the nest in relation to the total hatched eggs).
