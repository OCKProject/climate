 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>). In Bahia, by 2100 under RCP8.5, climate models project precipitation to decrease by 9.1–35.3 mm in September – December and February – March; however, January is projected to experience an increase by 5.7 mm (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7a</xref>). Climate models under RCP4.5 project a decrease in precipitation by 5.8–20.2 mm in September – December. While increases are projected for January – March by 12.1–22.4 mm (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7b</xref>). In Espirito Santo, precipitation is projected to decrease by 5.5–30.2 mm in September – December but increase in January by 2.5–9.2 mm (Fig.
