<p id="Par19" class="p">In Bahia, the best model (lowest AICc) for hatching success was average air temperature during incubation with accumulated rain during incubation (deviance = 26.5%; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5a</xref>; Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>). Both air temperature and precipitation were significant (p &lt; 0.01 for both parameters), with lower hatching success occurring at warmer and cooler temperatures, while the relationship with precipitation was unclear (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5a</xref>). In Espirito Santo, the best model for hatching success was average air temperature during incubation with accumulated rainfall in the two months prior to nesting (deviance = 28.9%; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5b</xref>; Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>). Within this model, air temperature during incubation was significant and had a negative effect (p = 0.04), while accumulated rainfall in the two months prior to nesting was highly significant and had a negative effect (p &lt; 0.01; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5b</xref>). In Rio de Janeiro, the best model was air temperature during incubation with accumulated rain in two months prior to the nest month (deviance = 70.7%, p &lt; 0.01 for both parameters; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5c</xref>, Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref>). In this model, air temperature had a positive effect while precipitation had a negative effect (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). Effects of local climatic conditions on hatching success were analyzed for individual beaches within each state (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref>).
