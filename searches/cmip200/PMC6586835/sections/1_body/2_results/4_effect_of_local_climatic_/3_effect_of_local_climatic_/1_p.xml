<p id="Par20" class="p">The best model for emergence rate within Bahia was average air temperature during incubation with accumulated rainfall in the nest month and two months prior (deviance = 18.9%, p &lt; 0.01 for both parameters; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5d</xref>; Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref>). Both temperature and precipitation had a positive relationship (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). The best model for emergence rate in Espirito Santo was accumulated rain in the two months prior to nesting (deviance = 24.1%, p &lt; 0.01; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5e</xref>; Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref>). There was no clear relationship of precipitation on emergence rate (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5e</xref>; Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). In Rio de Janeiro, the best model was accumulated rain in the two months prior to the nest month (deviance = 60.7%, p &lt; 0.01; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5f</xref>; Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref>). There was a positive effect of precipitation on emergence rate (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). Effects of local climatic conditions on emergence rate were analyzed for individual beaches within each state (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref>).
