<p id="Par15" class="p">Emergence rate varied spatially and temporally at our study sites (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). Across all years, Espirito Santo had the highest emergence rate (94.7% ± 8.8), followed by Rio de Janeiro (93.9% ± 8.6) and Bahia (89.7% ± 12.5). There was a significant difference in emergence rate among nesting states (one-way ANOVA, DF = 2, F = 322.9, p &lt; 0.001), with differences between Bahia and Espirito Santo (Tamhane’s test, p &lt; 0.001), Bahia and Rio de Janeiro (Tamhane’s test, p &lt; 0.001), and Espirito Santo and Rio de Janeiro (Tamhane’s test, p = 0.011).
