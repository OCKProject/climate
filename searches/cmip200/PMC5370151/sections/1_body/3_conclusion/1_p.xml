<p class="p">As sea levels rise, flood risks are projected to increase. Studies evaluating future flood risks are often silent on the impact of uncertainty in sea-level projections and instead consider the mean, best, or large quantile (i.e., 90%) estimate. We show how accounting for sea-level rise uncertainty can increase the area at risk of flooding and can increase the probability of flood occurrence. Using the San Francisco Bay area as an example, we demonstrate that these effects can be sizable. Specifically, we show how accounting for uncertainty increases the 100-yr return level by 0.5 m, shortens the return period from a 100-yr to a roughly 7-yr return period, changes the shape of the survival function, and roughly doubles the area at risk of flooding in San Francisco over using the mean sea-level rise estimate. Although, we use the San Francisco Bay area as an example the overall results are transferable to many regions and indicate that the method of accounting for sea-level rise can have considerable impacts on the design of flood risk management strategies.</p>
