 <xref rid="pone.0174666.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. An increase in the return level expands the area at risk of flooding (the area analyzed is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0174666.s005" class="xref">S5 Fig</xref>). This expansion hinges on the change of elevation along the coast. For example, roughly 15% more of the area between -2–8 m elevation in San Francisco County has an elevation of up to 2.7 m (2.7 m refers to the 100-yr flood height accounting for uncertain SLR) versus up to 2.2 m (2.2 m refers to the 100-yr flood height accounting for mean SLR) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174666.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>). Additionally, the upper tail is—in this specific case—of primary importance, because an area is flooded if the water is above a certain limit (e.g., an opening in a house). The probability that the water level is above a certain threshold is the probability in the upper tail (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174666.g005" class="xref">Fig 5</xref>). In this specific case, the area susceptible to flooding increases when we account for the tails in the SLR distribution. For example, in San Francisco County, the baseline 100-yr storm surge places roughly 1.6 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> at risk of flooding (

 <xref rid="pone.0174666.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Accounting for SLR in 2100 expands the area at risk of flooding to roughly 3.9 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> (using the mean SLR estimate) and roughly 8.0 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> (accounting for uncertain SLR). In comparison, accounting for SLR uncertainty increases the mean SLR flood risk area by roughly a factor of 2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174666.g005" class="xref">Fig 5</xref>). In Oakland (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0174666.s006" class="xref">S6 Fig</xref>) and Alameda (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0174666.s007" class="xref">S7 Fig</xref>), accounting for SLR uncertainty increases the mean SLR flood risk area by roughly 65% and 75%, respectively. As the area at risk of flooding increases, more people and assets are exposed to the hazard. This increased exposure has implications for the design of flood risk management strategies.
