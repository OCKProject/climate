<p class="p">These underestimated flood occurrences are due to the fact that accounting for the full distribution changes the shape of the survival function. We create a simple test to further investigate how incorporating the full distribution affects the survival function. For instance, we compare how the shape and characteristics of the SLR distribution impact the results by comparing our SLR distribution to a normal, log normal, and Pareto distribution (

Specifically, we approximate the data from a normal, log normal, and Pareto distribution using the mean and standard deviation estimates from our SLR distribution. As perhaps expected, the shape of the distribution impacts the resulting expected return level. The result shows that as the upper tail becomes fatter the return level increases and the shape of the survival function increases compared to the baseline survival function (
