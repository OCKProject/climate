<p class="p">We use relatively simple models and statistical methods to make a simple point. This simplicity is chosen to provide a hopefully transparent analysis. Yet, this simplicity requires us to make several approximations that lead to caveats and future research needs. For example, we neglect uncertainty associated with the GEV parameters. Additionally, we use a simple interpolation method to estimate the inverse of the survival function using the surrounding values when accounting for SLR uncertainty. If the return level value does not exist, then a value of zero is returned as the probability of flood occurrence. Due to the tight shape, the return level values with probabilities of flood occurrence below the 100,000-yr return period are assigned to have a zero probability of flood occurrence. A simple test suggests the impact of this approximation is relatively small, but can potentially lead to conservative estimates (

It is also important to note that future mean SLR for the SFB area may differ from projections in this study. This is because our SLR model may potentially neglect effects such as the melting ice sheets (including marine ice sheet instability and cliff instability [

Additionally, we do not address the possibility that future storm patterns could change in frequency or severity because of climate change. As a last example, this study assumes that no actions are taken to protect the coast. These caveats imply that this illustrative analysis is not to be used to assess actual coastal hazards.
