<p class="p">Future changes in sea level increase the return level for the 100-yr flood height in the SFB area. Our application of the global mean sea-level model [
 <xref rid="pone.0174666.ref001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>] suggests that sea level will rise by roughly 0.6 m by the year 2100, or between 0.3 and 1.1 m (mean and 90% credible interval) above the average sea level in 2000 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174666.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>). Currently, the baseline 100-yr storm surge in the SFB area is roughly 1.6 m (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174666.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>). If sea level is assumed to rise by the mean estimate or the 90% estimate in 2100, then the 100-yr flood height would increase to a return level of roughly 2.2 m or 2.5 m, respectively (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0174666.s002" class="xref">S2 Fig</xref>). Accounting for sea-level uncertainty further increases this return level to roughly 2.7 m (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174666.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>). Hence, projections that assume sea level will remain constant or will rise by the mean or 90% estimate, underestimate the return level associated with a 100-yr flood height by roughly 1.1 m, 0.5 m, and 0.2 m in the year 2100, respectively (
