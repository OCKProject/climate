 <xref rid="pone.0174666.ref051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]). A simple calculation can demonstrate how we account for uncertainty and why accounting for uncertainty can increase the probability of flood occurrence for a return level (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0174666.s003" class="xref">S3 Fig</xref>). For a very simple illustrative example, we describe how to estimate the probability associated with a flood height using three values from the SLR distribution. Note that for the analysis we use the entire distribution (2 × 10
 <sup class="sup">4</sup> values) and repeat the process for multiple flood heights to produce a new survival function accounting for uncertainty. For the example, consider using three samples from the SLR distribution (i.e., the mean SLR—1 standard deviation, the mean SLR, and the mean SLR + 1 standard deviation). Adding those sea-level values to the baseline storm surge survival function results in three new survival functions with 100-yr flood heights of roughly 2.0, 2.2, and 2.5 m (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0174666.s003" class="xref">S3b Fig</xref>). We can then estimate the expected probability of the 2.2 m flood height by averaging the probability of the 2.2 m flood height from each of the three new survival functions. The 2.2 m flood height has a probability of roughly 4 × 10
 <sup class="sup">−6</sup> (mean SLR—1 standard deviation), 0.01 (mean SLR) and 0.4 (mean SLR + 1 standard deviation). The results from averaging the three samples produces a higher return period for a specific flood height when compared to estimates that neglect uncertainty (i.e., accounting for the mean estimate). In this specific case, the probability of flood occurrence at the 2.2 m flood height when considering uncertainty shortens the return period from a 100-yr to a roughly 7-yr return period (
