<p class="p">Accounting for mean SLR underestimates the probability of flood occurrence in this specific case study. When we consider just the mean SLR, the 100-yr return period occurs at 2.2 m. If we account for the 90% SLR, the 100-yr return period occurs at 2.5 m (

By accounting for sea-level uncertainty, the return level of 2.2 m no longer has a 100-year return period. Instead, the probability of occurrence is higher as a 7-yr return period (∼15% probability) in the year 2100 (
