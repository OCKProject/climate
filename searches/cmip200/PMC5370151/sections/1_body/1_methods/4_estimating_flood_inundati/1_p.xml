<p class="p">We assess the area at risk of flooding (the area to be flooded under a certain height; e.g., the 100-yr flood height) with a geographic information system (ESRI ArcGIS Desktop) using 1/9-arc second (nominal resolution of ∼3 m) topobathy digital elevation models [
 <xref rid="pone.0174666.ref047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. We use the mosaicked elevation data as inputs for a simple bathtub inundation model [

 <xref rid="pone.0174666.ref048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. The elevation data is adjusted to the 1983–2001 local tidal datum mean sea level [
 <xref rid="pone.0174666.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Hence, any elevation below 0 m is considered to be current standing water (i.e., ocean, lakes, rivers, and reservoirs). We generate the 100-yr flood risk area by reclassifying the elevation values from 0 m to the estimated baseline storm surge or future flood height. The reclassified values are then extracted and converted from raster datasets to polygons. Using county subdivision shapefiles from the U.S. Census Bureau [
 <xref rid="pone.0174666.ref049" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>], we estimate the area at risk of flooding for San Francisco, Oakland, and Alameda. We replicate this process for each assumption about future flood height in the year 2100 (i.e., the 100-yr flood height accounting for mean SLR, the 100-yr flood height accounting for the Heberger et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0174666.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>] sea-level estimate, and the 100-yr flood height accounting for SLR uncertainty). All of the data is set to the NAD 1983 California Zone 3 projection. We use the State plane coordinate system to minimize distance and area distortions [
