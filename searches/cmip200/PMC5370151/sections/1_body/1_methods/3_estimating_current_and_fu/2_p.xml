<p class="p">We approximate the potential future 100-yr flood height (storm surge including SLR) by accounting for the mean sea-level anomaly and SLR uncertainty in the year 2100. For the 100-yr flood height accounting for mean SLR, we add the mean sea-level anomaly (compared to the year 2000) to the baseline 100-yr storm surge. We use several steps to approximate the effects of future SLR uncertainty, extrapolate a flood survival function, and approximate the 100-yr flood height accounting for SLR uncertainty. First, we add each SLR estimate from the distribution for the year 2100 to the baseline survival function. This results in 2 × 10
 <sup class="sup">4</sup> simulations of the future flood survival function (shown as the gray lines in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174666.g003" class="xref">Fig 3b</xref>). We then estimate the probability of a specific flood height occurring for each survival function simulation. If the probability falls in between two known values, we linearly interpolate the probability from the surrounding values. This results in 2 × 10
 <sup class="sup">4</sup> probability estimates for a specific flood height. We then average the 2 × 10
 <sup class="sup">4</sup> probability estimates for a specific flood height to approximate the actual probability for that return level. We replicate this process of estimating the return period for a range of flood heights from 1.1–3.3 m (see Caveats). This method produces a new flood survival function where the return level corresponding to a 1% probability of occurring in the year 2100 is taken to be the 100-yr flood height accounting for SLR uncertainty (the dark red curve and point in
