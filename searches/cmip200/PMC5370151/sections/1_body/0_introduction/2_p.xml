 <xref rid="pone.0174666.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. Sea-level projections are deeply uncertain because of the complex mechanisms controlling changes in sea level (i.e., thermal expansion of water, inputs from glaciers and ice sheets, changes in land water storage, glacial isostatic adjustment, vertical land motion from tectonics, and coastal erosion) [
