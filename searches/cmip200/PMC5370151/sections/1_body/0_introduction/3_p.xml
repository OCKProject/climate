 <xref rid="pone.0174666.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]). These studies provide valuable insights, but are often silent on the effects of known uncertainties surrounding SLR projections. For example, these studies often use the mean, best, or large quantile SLR estimate [

 <xref rid="pone.0174666.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>] have incorporated SLR distributions. Here, we expand on these studies by analyzing the question of how accounting for (an estimate of) the full distribution of SLR can impact flood risks as well as the design of flood risk management strategies. First, we explicitly show that neglecting uncertainty about SLR projections can result in considerable underestimation of flood risks. Second, we demonstrate and quantify how accounting for the full distribution changes the shape of the survival function. The survival function, also referred to as the exceedance probability, is one minus the cumulative frequency [
