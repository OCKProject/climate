 <xref rid="pone.0174666.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. As sea levels rise, settlements and ecosystems in low-lying coastal areas become more vulnerable to flooding. Currently, about 10% of the world’s population resides within 10 meters of present-day sea level [
 <xref rid="pone.0174666.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>] and about 40 million people are exposed to a 100-yr (also known as the 1-in-100 year or 1% annual exceedance probability) storm surge [
 <xref rid="pone.0174666.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Rising sea levels drive hazards for transportation and energy facilities, tourism, agriculture, and human lives [
 <xref rid="pone.0174666.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. These hazards motivate the design and implementation of flood risk management strategies around the world [

 <xref rid="pone.0174666.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. The strategies and infrastructures that manage flood risks are often designed for very low annual flooding probabilities, generally spanning the range from 1-in-50 to 1-in-10,000 years [

 <xref rid="pone.0174666.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. Designing these strategies requires information about both storm surge and sea levels [
