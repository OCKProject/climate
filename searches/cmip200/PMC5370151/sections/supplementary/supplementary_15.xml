  <p class="p">The maps of Oakland, CA display the baseline 100-yr flood risk area in yellow. In the year 2100, the potential 100-yr flood height includes the addition of sea-level projections. The future 100-yr flood risk area based on the mean sea-level projection is in orange, based on the Heberger et al. [

The location of the tide gauge is displayed as a star. However, in this figure we account for changes in land water storage in the year 2100 by adding roughly 0.55 m to the sea-level estimates [
