  <title class="title">Illustrative example (panel a and b) of how accounting for uncertainty increases the probability of flood occurrence and (panel b and c) the impact of approximating probabilities of occurrence below the 100,000-yr return period.</title>
  <p class="p">Panel a displays the probability density function of global mean sea-level rise in the year 2100 along with the mean Â±1 standard deviation projections (green lines). In panel b, the baseline storm surge (light blue) is shifted by sea-level projections of 0.4 m (-1 standard deviation; light green), 0.6 m (mean; green), and 0.9 m (+1 standard deviation; dark green) to represent potential future flood height. The average of the three return periods at 2.2 m is represented as the black square. The pink star is produced when the return period below the 100,000-yr return period is approximated as zero and then averaged with the two other return periods at 2.2 m. Note that (panel b and c) the approximation method for the return period at 2.2 m produces the same return period value as the result from accounting for the return periods below 100,000 years and hence displays little to no flood risk over-or-underestimation.</p>
