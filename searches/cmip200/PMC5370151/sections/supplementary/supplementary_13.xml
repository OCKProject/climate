   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174666.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>, panel a is the probability distribution of global mean sea-level rise in 2100 and panel b is the flood survival functions for San Francisco Bay. However, in this figure we adapt our sea-level rise estimates in the year 2100 by adding roughly âˆ¼0.55 m. This increase is roughly comparable to the increase used in Heberger et al. [
   <xref rid="pone.0174666.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Ultimately, adapting sea-level estimates to this change does not change the main conclusions of this analysis.
