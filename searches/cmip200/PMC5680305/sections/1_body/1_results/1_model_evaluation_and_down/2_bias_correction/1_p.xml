 </sup> (EDCDF) to correct the bias of the raw model output. Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref> shows the comparison of observed and simulated precipitation before and after bias correction during 1961~2005 over the TRB and YRB. The precipitation bias between observed and simulated before correction (after correction) are 254.42 mm (−0.02 mm) over the TRB and 219.16 mm (−0.01 mm) over the YRB. In these two basins, compared with the uncorrected annual precipitation of the ensemble model, time series of corrected outputs have a smaller bias, RD and RMSE with observed data. And the spatial correlation coefficient between observation and corrected outputs even reach 1.00 in Fig.

 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). The precipitation concentration period of corrected simulation is same as the observation over two basins. The variation features and quantitative value are well captured by the corrected simulation data.
