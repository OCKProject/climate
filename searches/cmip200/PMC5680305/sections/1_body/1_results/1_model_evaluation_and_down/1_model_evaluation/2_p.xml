<p id="Par8" class="p">On temporal scale, the annual precipitation measured over the TRB in the baseline period is only about 1/10 of the YRB. The observed (simulated) annual precipitation is 100.45 mm (354.86 mm) over TRB, where exists a great deviation. The observed (simulated) annual precipitation is 1092.73 mm (1311.89 mm) over YRB, and the simulated bias is about 19.61% of the measured value. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> displays the temporal trend of annual precipitation anomalies of the observation and multi-model ensemble from 1961 to 2005 over the TRB (a) and YRB (b). The anomaly is defined as the original data subtracting the mean. The annual precipitation is increasing in both the observed data (5.2 mm per decade) and the CMIP5 ensembles (3.7 mm per decade) over TRB, which both show significant increasing trend. The annual precipitation is increasing in the observed data (4.5 mm per decade) over the YRB, while decreasing in the CMIP5 ensembles (−8.7 mm per decade). The small whole fluctuation range of simulated data shows that the simulated rainfall peak is weakened. GCMs data failed to represent the uncertainty factors of annual precipitation, which could have a great impact on the subsequent analysis of extreme precipitation events.
