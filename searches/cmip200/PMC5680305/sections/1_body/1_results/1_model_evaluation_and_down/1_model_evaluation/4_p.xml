<p id="Par10" class="p">On spatial scale, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> displays the spatial distribution of observation (obs) and bias (obs-sim) between observation and simulated precipitation during 1961~2005 over the TRB and YRB. Over TRB, the observed precipitation is decreasing from outside to inside, which is well captured by the CMIP5 ensemble model. And the spatial correlation coefficient between observed and simulated data is 0.55 (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). However, the deviation is larger in some areas, especially in the high elevation areas where the bias can reach 400 mm. Over YRB, the spatial characteristic of observed precipitation is more in east and less in west, more in south and less in north. The large deviation between observation and simulated precipitation mainly occurs near the Sichuan basin and Yun-Gui plateau with greatly undulate terrain. The spatial correlation coefficient between observed and simulated is 0.35 (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>).
