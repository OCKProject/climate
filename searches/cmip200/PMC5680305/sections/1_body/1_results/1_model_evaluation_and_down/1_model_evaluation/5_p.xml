<p id="Par11" class="p">Based on the above analysis, the CMIP5 ensemble model can capture well in time series trend and spatial distribution over the TRB, while it is obviously better in data magnitude and seasonal rainfall distribution over the YRB. The Simulation of precipitation is significantly affected by elevation and topographic relief, and other climatic variables at the upper level should also be taken into account. The stations are few in the TRB, leading to the lack of original measured data used for CMIP5 simulation, which finally results in a large deviation of numerical simulation. Compared to the YRB in southeastern China, the observational data sequence is long and abundant, which is obviously affected by subtropical monsoon climate. At the same time, due to East West high lying low, the YRB is roughly three ladder-like distribution, resulting in a large deviation on simulating precipitation trends and spatial distribution.</p>
