 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>), the observed and simulated data both have sharp distinctions among seasons over two basins. Over TRB, the CMIP5 ensemble model, however, greatly overestimates the precipitation during each month and the observed (simulated) precipitation concentration period is June~August (May~July). The great bias between precipitation from CMIP5 and observed data has also been found in several studies. Fang,

 </sup> found that the precipitation from CMIP5 in Xinjiang, China (including the Tarim River Basin) is much higher than the measured data from station by two times from 1962 to 2011. Over YRB, the CMIP5 ensemble model slightly overestimates the precipitation during each month and seasonal variation of precipitation is well captured.
