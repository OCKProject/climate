Over the TRB, the maximum precipitation change mainly happens at lower elevations between 500~2000 m, located in most parts except mountains, among which the precipitation change under RCP8.5 is higher than the other two emission scenarios on the whole. And the change of precipitation decreases with altitude. In terms of greatly undulate terrain above 2000 m, the larger the relief amplitude of the study area is, the smaller the precipitation changes is. There is a larger range of precipitation change during 2061~2100 (0~200%) than during 2021~2060 (0~120%).
