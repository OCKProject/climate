<p id="Par22" class="p">Not only the elevation of study area, but also the relief amplitude has influence on simulating precipitation by CMIP5 data. However the topography of study area could have positive or negative effect on precipitation. There is no clear statistical relationship between precipitation simulation and elevation or relief amplitude in different basins. For the basin scale of 0.5° × 0.5° degrees, there is a negative correlation between the future precipitation change and the elevation over the TRB, while a positive correlation over the YRB. Based on the above rules, the future precipitation changes with elevation in the two basins can be verified.</p>
