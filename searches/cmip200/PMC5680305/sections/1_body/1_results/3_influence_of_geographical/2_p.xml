<p id="Par21" class="p">Over the YRB, contrary to the TRB, the change of precipitation increases with altitude, the maximum precipitation change mainly happens at higher elevations between 4000~5000 m, located in the source region of YRB on the Tibet Plateau. During 2021~2060, almost all grids have a certain increase in precipitation under the RCP2.6, except for some grids in the lower altitude area with the elevation between 2000~3000 m. While under the other two scenarios, the precipitation decreases with the elevation in the region below 3000 m. Compared with 2021~ 2060 (−10~30%), the precipitation tend to increase and all value changes are above 0 during 2061~2100 (0~80%). Same as what concluded in the TRB, the larger the relief amplitude of the study area is, the smaller the precipitation changes is, which could be applied to the whole basin.</p>
