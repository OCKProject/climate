<p id="Par15" class="p">In order to further analyze the spatial change of annual precipitation, Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref> shows the spatial changes in the CMIP5 ensemble model after the bias correction over the TRB and YRB, as percentage change of simulated values in 2021~2060 and 2061~2100 relative to 1961~2005 under RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. Over the TRB, precipitation shows no evident change near southern Tienshan Mountains, slightly upward trend near the Tarim River Mainstream Basin, sharp increase trend in the southern Tarim Basin and northern Altun Mountains and the increasing range of precipitation will increase with the increase of emission scenarios. In comparison to 2021~2060 (10~100%), more increase in annual precipitation is found under all scenarios in 2061~2100 (20~140%), especially in areas with greatly undulate terrain. Over the YRB, the annual precipitation in the source region of the YRB shows increasing trend (10~40%), the magnitude of the increase from east to west is increasing sequentially with the increase of the emission scenarios. For the decreasing trend in the early twenty-first century, although the annual precipitation is increasing under three emission scenarios, a decrease is also found over upper and middle reaches of the YRB during 2021~2060, especially for the RCP8.5 scenario. While during 2061~2100, under three emission scenarios, the precipitations keep similar change, with increase about 10% except in the source region of the YRB.
