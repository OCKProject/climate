<p id="Par14" class="p">Based on the CMIP5 ensemble model after the bias correction, the annual precipitation was analyzed in 2021~2100 relative to 1961~2005 under RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). Over the TRB, under RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, the annual precipitation will increase by 26.83% (−8.67~72.4%), 29.14% (−5.49~76.70%) and 41.72% (6.28~86.38%) relatively, which shows obvious increasing trend. Precipitation trends in different periods (2021~2060 and 2061~2100) were further analyzed, the precipitation shows upward trend firstly (3.2 mm/10a) and then downward trend (−3.1 mm/10a) under RCP2.6, which will increase more obviously in 2061~2100 (7.3 mm/10a) than in 2021~2060 (0.4 mm/10a) under RCP4.5, and the precipitation fluctuation continues to increase steadily under RCP8.5. Over the YRB, under RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, the annual precipitation will increase by 5.39% (−16.28~27.03%), 6.65% (−17.64~33.71%) and 5.99% (−18.72~42.61%) during 2021~2100 relative to 1961~2005. The annual precipitation in the early twenty-first century will reduce, while gradually increase in the middle and late twenty-first century. And the annual precipitation growth rate in 2061~2100 will decrease to some extent relative to 2021~2060. Under three emission scenarios, the annual precipitation trend lines keep similar, which indicates that the sensitivity of the annual precipitation to the emission scenario is not high over YRB, and the influence of climate change on precipitation will be further weakened. In general, the unified trend is that the fluctuation of precipitation will increase with the increase of scenarios emissions. However, the sensitivity of different hydrological factors to scenario emissions remains to be further verified.
