 </sup>. Under RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP8.5, percentage change of the seasonal precipitation was summarized in 2021~2060 and 2061~2100 relative to those during 1961~2005 (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). Although the future seasonal precipitation varies in two basins relative to that in the baseline period, the unified trend is that the change range of the seasonal precipitation in spring and winter is far greater than that in summer and autumn, which indicates that spring and winter precipitation is easier to be affected by climate change. Same as the annual precipitation, the change range of the seasonal precipitation over the TRB (5~150%) is greater than that over the YRB (0~15%).
