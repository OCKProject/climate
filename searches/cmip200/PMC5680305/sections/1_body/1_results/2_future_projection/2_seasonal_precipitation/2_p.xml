<p id="Par18" class="p">The seasonal precipitation over the TRB suggests increasing trend as a whole in the next two periods, except for summer precipitation, all of which increases with the increase of the emission scenarios; Over the YRB, in addition to the spring precipitation, other three season precipitations decrease in different degrees during 2021~2060. While during 2061~2100, precipitation in spring and winter (7~30%) was slightly higher than that of summer and autumn (5~11%), there is no clear correlation between the seasonal precipitation and the emission scenarios. What mentioned above further verifies that precipitation over the YRB is not sensitive to future climate change.</p>
