 </sup>. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>, the shape of the probability density curve of models is shifting to right, which is similar to that in the baseline period in both two basins, of which the “right shift” range in spring and winter is significantly greater than that in summer and autumn. Over the TRB, “attenuation property” is detected in winter and spring precipitation distribution during 2061~2100 relative to that in the baseline period or 2021~2060, while summer and autumn precipitation is similar to that in baseline period, which indicates that winter and spring precipitation could be more variable in late twenty-first century. Over the YRB, the precipitation distribution in winter and spring during 2021~2060 and in summer and autumn during 2061~2100 are more concentrated under the RCP2.6, indicating that the uncertainty of precipitation distribution in the YRB will increases under the RCP2.6.
