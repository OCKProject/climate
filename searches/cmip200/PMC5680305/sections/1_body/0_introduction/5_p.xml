 </sup>. Therefore the characteristics and response degree of future precipitation in typical watersheds to climate change should be analyzed. The main objectives of this study are to 1) evaluate 20 high-resolution CMIP5 models in terms of precipitation simulation for the Tarim River Basin and Yangtze River Basin, 2) project changes in both annual and monthly precipitation for the years 2021~2060 and 2061~2100 based on 1961~2005 for three RCPs: RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, and 3) compare the differences and links between future precipitation changes and topographic features at the two basins.
