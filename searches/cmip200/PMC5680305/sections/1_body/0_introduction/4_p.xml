<p id="Par5" class="p">A number of studies have focused primarily on evaluating ability of the CMIP5 models to simulate precipitation and applicability to projection of potential precipitation changes at a particular basin or region. With the high-resolution daily GPD datasets over the period of 1961~2013,Wu,

 </sup> conducted a comparative analysis of historical and projected spatial-temporal distribution of extreme precipitations between the Mississippi basin in USA and YRB in China using 31 CMIP5 models. In this study, we chose the TRB and YRB, where are in almost opposed external environment conditions.
