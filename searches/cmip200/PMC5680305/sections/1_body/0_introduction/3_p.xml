<p id="Par4" class="p">This study focuses on two areas in China: the Tarim River Basin (TRB) with an arid climate and the Yangtze River Basin (YRB) with a humid climate, the Dry-Wet climate zones of which divided by aridity index combined with measured annual precipitation and annual potential evapotranspiration. The TRB is located in northwestern China, characterized by limited rainfall and high evaporation
