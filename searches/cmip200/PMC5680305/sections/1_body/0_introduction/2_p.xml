 </sup> discussed the relation between the elevation of the study area and precipitation, temperature simulated by multi-model ensemble, who pointed out that the ensemble of CMIP5 underestimates the actual temperature and overestimates the actual precipitation in higher altitude regions over Indus River Basin. In this study, we focus on the influence of the topography of study area while simulating precipitation, particularly in elevation and relief amplitude.
