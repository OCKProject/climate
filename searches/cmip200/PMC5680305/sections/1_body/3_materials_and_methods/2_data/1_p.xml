<p id="Par29" class="p">Twenty high-resolution global climate models in CMIP5 were selected to project future changes of precipitation in the TRB and YRB (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). The historical climate simulations were extracted in the baseline period (1961~2005) to simulate the past precipitation, and the future projections were developed to evaluate the future climate changes for both near future (2021~2060) and long term future (2061~2100) under three RCP scenarios: RCP2.6, the low emission scenario, RCP4.5, the secondary stabilization scenario, and RCP8.5, the high emission scenarios

 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>, different GCMs of the CMIP5 models have different resolutions. The observed data of daily precipitation used in this study was obtained from the high resolution gridded CN05.1 dataset (0.25° × 0.25°), which includes measurements at the 2400 stations in China

 </sup>. In order to compare the observed and simulated precipitation, we interpolated the gridded data into 0.5° × 0.5° resolution with a bilinear interpolation. The outputs of GCMs were further integrated to the multi-model ensemble datasets using an arithmetic averaging approach. Digital Elevation models (DEM) of study areas were obtained from Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation data with 90 × 90 m grid cell resolution.
