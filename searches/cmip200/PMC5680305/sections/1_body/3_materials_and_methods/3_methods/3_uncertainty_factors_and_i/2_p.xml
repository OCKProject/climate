<p id="Par34" class="p">Based on the uncertainty research, the influence of external changes over study areas on precipitation simulation should be considered. Based on the climatic conditions, relationship between precipitation change and the topographic features are further explored over the TRB and YRB respectively. In this paper, two topographic features, the elevation and relief amplitude, were used to analyze the internal relations. Relief amplitude refers to the difference of elevation between the highest and the lowest point in a particular area

 </sup>. In order to get the grid DEM data, corresponding with precipitation data, the variables of elevation and relief amplitude on 0.5° × 0.5° resolution are obtained by using bilinear interpolation method with GIS resampling technique (Figure.
