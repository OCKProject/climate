<p id="Par25" class="p">Based on the CMIP5 ensemble model after the bias correction, under RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, the increasing range of precipitation during 2021~2100 relative to 1961~2005 will increase with the increase of emission scenarios, especially over the TRB. The mean precipitation over TRB will increase by 26.83% (−8.67~72.4%), 29.14% (−5.49~76.70%) and 41.72% (6.28~86.38%) under three emission scenarios relatively, which shows obvious increasing trend. In comparison to 2021~2060 (10~100%), more increase in annual precipitation is found under all scenarios in 2061~2100 (20~140%). Precipitation shows sharp increasing trend in the southern Tarim Basin and northern Altun Mountains, which means that drought could be relived to some extent in these areas. The wide relative fluctuation range of annual precipitation indicates that the extreme events of precipitation will causes greater variation over the TRB. The annual precipitation over the YRB will increase by 5.39% (−16.28~27.03%), 6.65% (−17.64~33.71%) and 5.99% (−18.72~42.61%) under three emission scenarios relatively, which in the early twenty-first century will reduce, while gradually increase in the middle and late twenty-first century. For the decreasing trend in the early twenty-first century, although the mean precipitation is increasing, a decrease is also found over upper and middle reaches of the YRB during 2021~2060. While during 2061~2100, the precipitations keep similar change under three emission scenarios, with increase about 10% except in the source region of YRB (10~40%). The future precipitation change over YRB shows that water resources shortage will be eased until the late twenty-first century, which indicates that the “Drought-flood Abrupt Alternation” may occur in the middle twenty-first century.</p>
