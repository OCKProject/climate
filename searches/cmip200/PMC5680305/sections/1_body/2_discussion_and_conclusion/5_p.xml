<p id="Par27" class="p">The elevation and relief amplitude of the study area have influence on simulating precipitation with CMIP5 data. The maximum precipitation change mainly happens at lower elevations between 500~2000 m over the TRB, but at higher elevations between 4000~5000 m over the YRB. The change of precipitation will decrease with elevation over the TRB, while it increase over the YRB. In terms of the relief amplitude, the variation of precipitation will decrease with it over two basins at some extent. The elevation and relief amplitude of study area may increase the uncertainty of simulating precipitation by CMIP5 data.</p>
