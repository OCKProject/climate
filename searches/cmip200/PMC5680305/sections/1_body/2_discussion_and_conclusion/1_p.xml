<p id="Par23" class="p">Based on the precipitation of CN05.1 datasets, the ability of the CMIP5 ensemble model in simulating the historical climate and projecting the future climate change were evaluated in the TRB and YRB. Although with the bias from the GCMs limitations, particularly over the TRB, we could project the temporal and spatial distribution of precipitation based on the CMIP5 after bias correction. The statistical bias correction method (EDCDF) was shown to be useful for correcting the CMIP5 outputs. The uncertainty in the CMIP5 projections was explored in terms of elevation and relief amplitude. The major conclusions of this study were summarized as following.</p>
