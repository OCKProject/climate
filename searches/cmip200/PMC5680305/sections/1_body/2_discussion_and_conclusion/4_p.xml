<p id="Par26" class="p">The seasonal precipitation is influenced by varying degrees of impacts from different emission scenarios, which in spring and winter is far greater than that in summer and autumn based on the output of GCMs. Same as the annual precipitation, the change range of seasonal precipitation over the TRB (5~150%) is far greater than that over the YRB (0~15%). The increasing range of spring and winter precipitation (50~150%) is beneficial to the accumulation of glacier and the increase of water resources over the TRB, which is also positive to the development of agriculture. The extensive distribution of precipitation in spring and winter indicates that the precipitation in winter and spring is more changeable in the late twenty-first century. In addition to the spring precipitation, other three season precipitations decrease in different degrees during 2021~2060. While during 2061~2100, precipitation in spring and winter (7~30%) is slightly higher than that of summer and autumn (5~11%), the monitor effort need to be strengthened in case of spring flood disaster over the TRB.</p>
