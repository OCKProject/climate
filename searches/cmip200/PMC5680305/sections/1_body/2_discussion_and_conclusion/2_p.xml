<p id="Par24" class="p">The CMIP5 ensemble model behave differently on precipitation simulation in different basins. The model output can capture well in the trend of time series and the spatial distribution at the TRB. The annual precipitation increases according to the observed data (5.2 mm per decade) and the CMIP5 ensembles (3.7 mm per decade) at the TRB. The observed data shows that annual precipitation has an increasing trend (4.5 mm per decade) at the YRB, while the CMIP5 ensembles suggests a decreasing trend (−8.7 mm per decade) with a spatial correlation coefficient is 0.35. The model output seems providing better projection in magnitude and seasonal rainfall distribution at the YRB. The relative deviations of annual precipitation at the TRB and YRB are 259.17% and 19.61% respectively, likely due to the fact that few stations at the TRB provided less measurements used for the CMIP5 simulations. The simulated precipitation concentration period exists an offset over TRB, while seasonal variation of precipitation is well captured over the YRB, which may be resulted from the reason that precipitation over the YRB is obviously affected by subtropical monsoon climate.</p>
