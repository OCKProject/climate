 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1a,b</xref> shows the distributions of correlation coefficients between observed surface temperature and ASO. The variations in ASO are closely linked to surface temperature changes in the middle of the Eurasian continent. This phenomenon has been reported in previous studies using observations
