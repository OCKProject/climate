 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a,d,g,j</xref> shows that the ozone forcing in E
 <sub class="sub">4–6</sub> is mainly improved in the high-latitude stratosphere of both hemispheres. This implies that the improved surface temperature simulation is mainly related to the improved high-latitude stratospheric ozone variability. The variations in ASO first influence Arctic polar stratosphere temperature by radiative processes. It is well known that a cooler (warmer) polar stratosphere strengthens (weakens) the temperature gradient from the tropics to the Pole. According to the thermal wind relationship, this situation results in a stronger (weaker) stratospheric polar vortex. Thus, improving the high-latitude stratospheric ozone variability should first improve the simulated stratospheric temperature and circulation at high latitudes. We compare the simulated stratospheric temperature and circulation of the Northern Hemisphere high latitudes from E
 <sub class="sub">1–3</sub> and from E
 <sub class="sub">4–6</sub> with observations. Taking the temperature and zonal wind from ERA-Interim for the period 1979–2005 as the references, the correlation coefficients between stratospheric temperature from E
 <sub class="sub">4–6</sub> and from ERA-Interim are larger than the correlation coefficients between stratospheric temperature from E
 <sub class="sub">1–3</sub> and from ERA-Interim (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3a</xref>). The improved simulations of stratospheric temperature variability over the North Pole improve the simulation of stratospheric circulation variability in E
 <sub class="sub">4–6</sub> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3b</xref>). According to the above established connection between the northern high-latitude stratospheric circulation anomalies and circulation variations over the middle of the Eurasian continent, the improved simulation of Arctic stratospheric circulation variability in E
 <sub class="sub">4–6</sub> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3b</xref>) explains how improved ozone forcing improves the surface temperature simulation over the middle of the Eurasian continent.
