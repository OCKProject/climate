 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> compares the simulated Victoria Mode and ENSO variations from E
 <sub class="sub">1–3</sub> and from E
 <sub class="sub">4–6</sub> with observations. Taking the Victoria Mode variations from HadSST and ENSO index from Climate Prediction Center/NOAA for the period 1979–2005 as the references, the correlation coefficients between the Victoria Mode (ENSO) from E
 <sub class="sub">4–6</sub> and from HadSST (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4b,d</xref>) are larger than those between the Victoria Mode (ENSO) from E
 <sub class="sub">1–3</sub> and from HadSST (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4a,c</xref>). Since the simulation of ENSO variations is improved as a result of improved ASO variations, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b,d</xref> shows that the pattern of improved surface temperature over the eastern Pacific is similar to the pattern of ENSO. It is well known that ENSO links the SST change over the Indian Ocean and Indo Pacific warm pool via the Walker circulation. Thus, the simulations of surface temperature over the Indian Ocean and Indo Pacific warm pool are also improved in E
