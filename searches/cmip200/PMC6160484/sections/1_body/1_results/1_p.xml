<p id="Par9" class="p">We first compare the simulated interannual variability of global average surface temperatures from E
 <sub class="sub">1–3</sub> and from E
 <sub class="sub">4–6</sub> with the observations. Taking the surface temperature from GISTEMP as the observations, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a,b</xref> shows the time series of global average surface temperature for the period 1979–2005 from simulations and observation. The correlation coefficient between global average surface temperature from E
 <sub class="sub">1–3</sub> and from GISTEMP is insignificant (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.17, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref>), while the correlation coefficient between surface temperature from E
 <sub class="sub">4–6</sub> and from GISTEMP is significant (
 <italic class="italic">r =</italic> 0.39, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b</xref>). This result can be further confirmed by surface temperature from HadCRUT4 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2c,d</xref>). This illustrates that the simulated variability of global average surface temperature is improved when the ozone forcing in the model is replaced by MERRA 2 ozone.
