 </sup>. Thus, a possible pathway for northern high-latitude stratospheric circulation anomalies to affect circulation anomalies over the middle of Eurasian continent may involve two steps: a high-latitude stratosphere-to-troposphere vertical pathway and an Arctic-to-Eurasia horizontal teleconnection. The high-latitude stratosphere-to-troposphere vertical pathway has been investigated

 </sup>. They pointed out that the region 60°–90°N, 180°–120°W is the possible location of the main tunnel through which Arctic stratospheric circulation anomalies caused by the ASO changes reach down into the troposphere. To study the horizontal propagation of circulation anomalies from the Arctic to Eurasia in detail, the ray paths of waves at 200 hPa generated by the perturbed circulation over the region 60°–90°N, 180°–120°W are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>. The wave ray paths represent the climate teleconnections; i.e., the propagation of stationary waves in realistic flows. The calculation of the wave ray paths and application of the barotropic model are described in detail by previous studies

 </sup>. We found that the Rossby waves generated by the perturbed circulation over the north polar upper troposphere mainly propagate eastward along a line of latitude; after almost circling the earth, the Rossby waves reach the middle of the Eurasian continent in about 15 days. The above analysis establishes a connection between the northern high-latitude stratospheric circulation anomalies and circulation variations over the middle of the Eurasian continent. This may be why previous studies found that westerly wind variations over the middle of the Eurasian continent were influenced by ASO changes
