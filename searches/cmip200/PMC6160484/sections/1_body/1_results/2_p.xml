 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a,c</xref> shows the horizontal distributions of correlation coefficients between simulated (E
 <sub class="sub">1–3</sub>) and observed (GISTEMP/HadCRUT4) global surface temperature. One most obvious feature in the two panels is that the correlation coefficients in the middle of the Eurasian continent are significant (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a,c</xref>), meaning that there is a certain degree of similarity between simulated surface temperature variations from E
 <sub class="sub">1–3</sub> and the observations in the middle of the Eurasian continent. However, the correlation coefficients in other places are almost insignificant. It illustrates that the modeling capability of the climate model to surface temperature variability needs to be further improved.
