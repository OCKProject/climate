<p id="Par11" class="p">Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b,d</xref> shows that the simulated surface temperature variations from E
 <sub class="sub">4–6</sub> are significantly correlated with observations (GISTEMP/HadCRUT4) in many regions. The two main features are: first, in the middle of the Eurasian continent the correlation coefficients between surface temperatures from E
 <sub class="sub">4–6</sub> and from observations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b,d</xref>) are much larger than those between surface temperatures from E
 <sub class="sub">1–3</sub> and from observations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a,c</xref>). Second, in the lower latitudes the correlation coefficients are significantly improved in E
 <sub class="sub">4–6</sub> compared with those in E
 <sub class="sub">1–3</sub>. It means that the improved stratospheric ozone forcing in E
 <sub class="sub">4–6</sub> compared with in E
 <sub class="sub">1–3</sub> mainly improves simulated surface temperature in the middle of the Eurasian continent and in lower latitudes, which is responsible for the improved simulation of global average surface temperature in E
 <sub class="sub">4–6</sub> compared with that in E
 <sub class="sub">1–3</sub> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). In the following paragraphs we will discuss the mechanisms by which improved ozone forcing improves the surface temperature simulation over these two major areas.
