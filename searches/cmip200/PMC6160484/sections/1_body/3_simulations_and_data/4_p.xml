 </sup>. GISTEMP combines land surface air temperatures primarily from the GHCN-M version 3 with sea surface temperature (SST) data from the ERSSTv3b analysis into a comprehensive global surface temperature data set spanning the period from 1880 to the present at monthly resolution, on a 2° × 2° latitude–longitude grid. The other surface temperature dataset used in this paper is version 4 of HadCRUT4, which is a set of reanalysis monthly data at a horizontal resolution of 5° × 5° from the UK Met Office Hadley Centre and the University of East Anglia’s Climatic Research Unit

 </sup> that combines the global land surface temperature data set, CRUTEM4, and the global SST data set, HadSST3. SST data were obtained from the UK Met Office Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research SST (HadSST) field datasets. Geopotential height, temperature, and zonal wind were obtained from the ERA-Interim reanalysis.
