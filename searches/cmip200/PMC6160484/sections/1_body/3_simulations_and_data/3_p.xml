<p id="Par23" class="p">Ozone values were obtained from the Stratospheric Water and OzOne Satellite Homogenized (SWOOSH) dataset, which is a merged record of stratospheric ozone and water vapor measurements taken by a number of limb sounding and solar occultation satellites over the previous 30 years, spanning 1984 to 2013

 </sup>. Moreover, its primary product is a monthly-mean zonal-mean gridded dataset containing ozone and water vapor data from the SAGE-II/III, UARS HALOE, UARS MLS, and Aura MLS instruments. The horizontal resolution and vertical pressure range of the ozone data are 2.5° zonal mean (latitude: 89°S to 89°N) and 316–1 hPa (31 levels), respectively. Another ozone dataset is available from the Global Ozone Chemistry and Related trace gas Data Records for the Stratosphere (GOZCARDS, 1984–2013) project

 </sup>. The zonal mean satellite–based GOZCARDS (1984–2013) is produced from high quality data from past missions (e.g., SAGE, HALOE data) as well as ongoing missions (ACE-FTS and Aura MLS). Its meridional resolution is 10° with 25 pressure levels from the surface up to 0.1 hPa. MERRA2 ozone (longitude × latitude resolution: 0.5° × 0.5°) uses 72 pressure levels from the surface up to 0.1 hPa

 </sup>. The vertical resolution of MERRA2 is ~1–2 km in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) and 2–4 km in the middle and upper stratosphere. MERRA2 is produced using the Goddard Earth Observing System Model, Version 5 (GEOS-5) with ozone from the Solar Backscattered Ultra Violet (SBUV) radiometers from October 1978 to October 2004, and thereafter from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and AURA Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS)
