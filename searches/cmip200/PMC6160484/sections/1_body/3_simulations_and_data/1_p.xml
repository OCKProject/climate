<p id="Par21" class="p">We used the National Center for Atmospheric Research’s CESM, version 1.0.6, which is a fully coupled global climate model that incorporates an interactive atmosphere (CAM/WACCM) component, ocean (POP2), land (CLM4), and sea ice (CICE). For the atmospheric component, we used version 4 of WACCM

 </sup>. WACCM4 is a climate model that has detailed middle-atmosphere chemistry and a finite volume dynamical core, and it extends from the surface to approximately 140 km. For our study, we disabled the interactive chemistry (WACCM-GHG scheme). WACCM4 has 66 vertical levels, with a vertical resolution of about 1 km in the tropical tropopause and lower stratosphere layers. Simulations used a horizontal resolution of 1.9° × 2.5° (latitude × longitude) for the atmosphere and approximately the same for the ocean.
