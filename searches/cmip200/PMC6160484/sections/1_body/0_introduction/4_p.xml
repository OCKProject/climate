<p id="Par5" class="p">Previous studies showed that the variations in stratospheric ozone in the northern and southern high latitudes could significantly influence climate changes of Northern and Southern hemispheres. This inspires us to check whether the ozone forcing in our climate model is in agreement with observations. If there is a significant difference between the ozone forcing and the observed ozone variations, it is likely to have a negative impact on the quality of the simulation results.</p>
