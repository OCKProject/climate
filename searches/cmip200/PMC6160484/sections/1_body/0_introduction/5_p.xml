<p id="Par6" class="p">Here, we investigate the stratospheric ozone forcing in a fully coupled global climate model, the Community Earth System Model (CESM) Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model, version 4 (WACCM4) with WACCM4-GHG scheme (more details of the model are given in section Simulations and Data), and compare the ozone variations specified in the model with observations. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref> shows the correlation coefficients between the stratospheric ozone variations from WACCM4 model forcing (based on CMIP5 ozone output) and Stratospheric Water and OzOne Satellite Homogenized (SWOOSH) (see the data description in section Simulations and Data). It is found that the stratospheric ozone variations in the WACCM4, which is based on CMIP5 ozone output, are well correlated with the observations in mid and lower latitudes, but not in the high latitudes of the Northern and Southern hemispheres. It is because ozone in the polar vortex regions has much higher variability than lower latitudes which might require much larger ensemble size to capture the observed ozone variations

 </sup>. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b and c</xref> shows the variations in stratospheric ozone averaged over the region 60°–90°N and 150–30 hPa and in the region 60°–90°S and 200–50 hPa for the period 1979 to 2015, respectively. The both variations in ozone from WACCM4 forcing data (based on CMIP5 ozone output) and from observations (SWOOSH) showed a clear decreasing trend from 1979 to 2005 in the stratosphere at the two poles. However, the ozone variability in WACCM4 is evidently different from that in observations in the two regions. These results can be further confirmed by observations from Global Ozone Chemistry and Related trace gas Data Records for the Stratosphere (GOZCARDS) (see section Simulations and Data, data description) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1d–f</xref>). Note that in these two regions the variability and depletion of ozone concentration are most pronounced
