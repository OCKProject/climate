<p id="Par3" class="p">In recent years, the impacts of stratospheric ozone on climate changes have received widespread attention. The connection between Arctic stratospheric ozone (ASO) variations and tropospheric climate change over the Northern Hemisphere has been revealed in observations and simulations. As early as the 1990s, some studies noted a significant surface temperature warming trend in the mid-to-high latitudes of the Eurasian continent since the late 1970s

 </sup>. Though inevitably connected to the increase in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, the warming trend was also found to be strongly associated with enhanced westerly winds caused by ASO depletion
