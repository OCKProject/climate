 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1g</xref> shows the correlation coefficients between stratospheric ozone variations from MERRA2 and SWOOSH (see section Simulations and Data of the data description). It is found that the stratospheric ozone variations from MERRA2 not only have a good correlation with those from SWOOSH in the mid and lower latitudes but also in the high latitudes in both hemispheres. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1h,i</xref> shows the variations in stratospheric ozone averaged over the region 60°–90°N and 150–30 hPa and over the region 60°–90°S and 200–50 hPa, respectively. The ozone variability based on MERRA2 is in good agreement with that based on SWOOSH over these two regions. These results can be further confirmed by the observations from GOZCARDS (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1j–l</xref>) (see section Simulations and Data). Replacing the originally specified stratospheric ozone forcing in WACCM4 by MERRA2 ozone to perform the historical experiment would help to test the sensitivity of the simulated climate to stratospheric ozone forcing. Note that MERRA2 ozone data are used because they have no missing values in the stratosphere compared with ozone from SWOOSH and GOZCARDS. The global surface temperature variability partly reflects the characteristics of global climate change. In this study, we choose the surface temperature to check whether improving the stratospheric ozone variability improves the simulation of global climate change in WACCM4. The experimental design is described in the next section.
