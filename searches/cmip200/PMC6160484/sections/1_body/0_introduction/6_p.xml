 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a–f</xref> shows that although the trend of stratospheric ozone is well represented in the WACCM4, the stratospheric ozone variability from the WACCM4 is not in good agreement with the observed stratospheric ozone variability in the high latitudes. This poor agreement is also found in many other climate models

 </sup>. It is well known that a large number of model evaluation studies showed that although the simulated spatial patterns of climatic elements in historical experiments from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 3 (CMIP 3) to CMIP 5 are closer to the observations, the simulated variability of these climatic elements needs further improvement. Here, we pose a question: if we replace the ozone forcing in WACCM4 with ozone data that have variations closer to those observed, would this help to improve the simulated climatic elements in the reproduced experiments by WACCM4?
