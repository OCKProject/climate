<p id="Par18" class="p">Previous studies have shown that the variations in stratospheric ozone in the northern and southern high latitudes could significantly influence changes in the Northern and Southern Hemisphere climate. However, the stratospheric ozone variations specified in many climate models are not in good agreement with the observed stratospheric ozone variations. This led us to consider whether part of the deviation between the simulated and observed variabilities of climatic elements from a large number of models is related to the poor agreement between observed ozone variations and the stratospheric ozone forcing applied in the climate models. Here, we investigated the improvement of simulated surface temperature by replacing the original specified ozone forcing with MERRA2 ozone in WACCM4.</p>
