<p id="Par20" class="p">This study focuses on the influence of stratospheric ozone variability on surface temperature variability. Here, we briefly discuss the influence of stratospheric ozone trend on surface temperature trend. Two additional experiments (E
 <sub class="sub">7</sub> and E
 <sub class="sub">8</sub>) are performed. E
 <sub class="sub">7</sub> is a historical simulation covering the period 1955–2005. E
 <sub class="sub">8</sub> is the same as E
 <sub class="sub">7</sub>, but the linear trend of specified ozone forcing in the stratosphere was removed. An overview of the experiments (E
 <sub class="sub">7</sub> and E
 <sub class="sub">8</sub>) is given in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>. The influence of stratospheric ozone trend on surface temperature can be obtained by comparing the results of E
 <sub class="sub">7</sub> and E
 <sub class="sub">8</sub>. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5a,b</xref> shows the linear trends of global surface temperature for the period 1955–2005 from GISTEMP and E
 <sub class="sub">7</sub>. In general, WACCM4 simulated the global warming trend fairly well compared with the observations, except that the simulated linear trend at high latitudes in northern Eurasia is evidently larger than that observed and there is a warming trend over the North Pacific in the simulation that is not seen in the observations. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5c</xref> shows the linear trends of global surface temperature from E
 <sub class="sub">8</sub>. The linear trends in E
 <sub class="sub">8</sub> are weaker than those in E
 <sub class="sub">7</sub> in both hemisphere high latitudes. This feature is easier to see in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5d</xref>, which shows the difference of linear trends between E
 <sub class="sub">8</sub> and E
 <sub class="sub">7</sub>. It is well known that stratospheric ozone decreased from 1955 to 2005. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5d</xref> implies that the decreasing trend of stratospheric ozone may have enhanced the warming trend in both hemisphere high latitudes during the second half of the 20th century. Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S5</xref> shows the linear trend in surface temperature for the period 1955–1995. It shows that the warming trends in the Arctic and Antarctic from 1955 to 1995 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S5</xref>) are larger than those from 1955 to 2005 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5b</xref>). This means that the behavior of trend variations in surface temperature during 1955–2005 is similar to those for ozone. The possible reasons why decreased stratospheric ozone warms high latitudes, and whether the Arctic stratospheric ozone decrease would contribute to the Arctic amplification effect, are open questions that deserve further investigation. Recently, a study found that Arctic stratospheric polar vortex possibly contributed to and sustained the recent hiatus in Eurasian winter warming

 </sup>. Whether the stratospheric recovery after 2000 would also contribute to the hiatus of global warming is also an interesting question.
