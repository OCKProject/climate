<p id="Par19" class="p">Replacing the original specified stratospheric ozone forcing with MERRA2 stratospheric ozone improved the variability of global average surface temperature simulated by WACCM4. The main regions where the simulated surface temperature is significantly improved are the middle of the Eurasian continent and at lower latitudes. The improved stratospheric ozone variations improve the simulated variability of stratospheric temperature and circulation in both hemispheres at high latitudes. In the Northern Hemisphere, the ASO variations first influence the circulation over the north polar upper troposphere. The Rossby waves generated by the disturbed circulation over the north polar upper troposphere propagate eastward along a line of latitude and then reach the middle of the Eurasian continent to influence the local circulation and surface temperature. We found that the improved stratospheric ozone forcing improves the simulated variations of the Victoria Mode, which improves the simulation of ENSO variations and surface temperature changes over the Indian Ocean and Indo Pacific warm pool. In the Southern Hemisphere, improved stratospheric circulation variations resulting from improved Southern Hemisphere stratospheric ozone variations influence the simulation of westerly winds. This helps to improve the simulation of surface temperature in the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
