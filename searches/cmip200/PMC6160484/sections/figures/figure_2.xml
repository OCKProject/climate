  <p class="p">The time series of simulated globally averaged surface temperature. (
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>) Time series of globally averaged annual surface temperature anomalies for the period 1979–2005 from E
   <sub class="sub">1–3</sub> (blue line) and GISTEMP (red line). (
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>) Same as (

   <sub class="sub">1–3</sub> (blue line) and HadCRUT4 (red line). (
   <bold class="bold">d</bold>) Same as (
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>), but for surface temperature from E
   <sub class="sub">4–6</sub> (blue line) and HadCRUT4 (red line). The anomalies are obtained by removing the seasonal cycle and the time series are detrended. The correlation coefficients (
   <italic class="italic">r</italic>) between the two lines are shown in the top right corner and the “*” means 
   <italic class="italic">r</italic> is significant at the 95% confidence level. The values in bracket are uncertainty range for the correlation coefficient at the 95% confidence level.
