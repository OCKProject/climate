  <p class="p">The spatial distribution of simulated global surface temperature. (
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>) Horizontal distribution of correlation coefficients between global surface temperature variations from E
   <sub class="sub">1–3</sub> and GISTEMP for the period 1979–2005. (
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>) Same as (

   <sub class="sub">4–6</sub> and GISTEMP. (
   <bold class="bold">c</bold>) Same as (
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>), but for surface temperature from E
   <sub class="sub">1–3</sub> and HadCRUT4. (
   <bold class="bold">d</bold>) Same as (
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>), but for surface temperature from E
   <sub class="sub">4–6</sub> and HadCRUT4. Surface temperature variations are obtained by removing the seasonal cycle and are detrended. Only positive correlations coefficients are shown. In the color bar, the values 0.136, 0.255, 0.323, 0.381, 0.445 and 0.487 correspond to the 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 99% and 99.9% confidence levels, respectively.
