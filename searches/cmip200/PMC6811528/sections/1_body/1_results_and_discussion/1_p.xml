<p id="Par7" class="p">The 50-year projection (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>) shows a contrasting response to climate change for the pelagic fish species living in the TB contra the AB. The AB fish population is projected to decrease in abundance while the TB population is projected to remain stable. Comparing two 20-year periods, 1980–2000 vs. 2040–2060 under the RCP 4.5 emission scenario, the AB shows a future decrease of temporal overlap between fish and prey because of earlier occurrence of prey in spring while the fish requirement timing remains relatively constant during the year (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). By contrast, for the TB both the predator and prey have advanced timing, leading to maintenance of the temporal overlap (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>).
