 </sup>. Sensitivity analysis of our model shows that during the historical period an increase of temperature was associated with an increase of abundance for the high-latitude AB species, while the temperature effect was weaker for the mid-latitude TB species (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>). Yet, our results also suggest that the AB species is strongly negatively affected by changed phenology if temperature increases beyond the historical range (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>). This was because the projected warming led to more frequent mismatch situations and recruitment failure of the AB fish (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>), consistent with high thermal specialisation of Arctic species (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> and
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>
 </sup>). Already during the historical period, the distribution of the match-mismatch situations is different between AB and TB (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>). AB more often shows situations with full match or full mismatch (extremes) than TB. This pattern becomes even more pronounced during the projection period with over 50% of the years displaying a full mismatch and hence a very low production of young indivivuals. This scenario was envisioned by Cury

 </sup> as a response to a change in the amplitude of year-to-year variations in prey timing in regions where interannual variability in temperature is expected to increase. The strong population decrease described by our model can be attributed to a too frequent lack of recruitment. While temperature increase leads to an earlier phenology for both plankton and fish in both systems, the impact is of different intensity with stronger effect on AB than TB fish (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>). In AB, the reason for the modelled mismatch was an early peak timing of the plankton (about 1.2 months, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>) that was not matched by the fish (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Of the components determining the peak timing of larval feeding, the spawning date for the AB fish increased in variability and the median spawning date shifted to about 0.4 months later in the season in the projected future, while the hatching time decreased by approximately 0.4 months, the yolk resorption duration being similar for both periods. The projected timing of larval feeding for the AB fish thereby only changed slightly in response to the increasing temperatures. The TB species, in contrast, appeared to sustain a projected temperature increase beyond the historical range by adjusting the timing of their reproduction to temperature and hence prey availability, suggesting that temperature effects on prey abundance and timing are unlikely to limit the realised thermal niche. In other words, our results shed light on how match-mismatch dynamics may restrain the realised thermal niches of AB fish more than of TB fish, which is consistent with the general pattern of narrower thermal niches for marine fish in polar regions in contrast to temperate regions (see Fig.
