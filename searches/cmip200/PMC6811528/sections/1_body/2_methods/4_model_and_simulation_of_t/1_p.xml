<p id="Par23" class="p">The equations used to calculate the change in fish abundance are given in Tables 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>. We considered that the juveniles surviving to year t + 1 (n
 <sub class="sub">t+1</sub>) produced by adults in year t (N
 <sub class="sub">fish,t</sub>) are match-mismatch dependent on a plankton population (N
 <sub class="sub">plk,t</sub>). We assume that there is no density-dependence at the egg production, but food-driven density-dependence in survival of the offspring. In other words, we assumed that offspring production is directly proportional to the number of adults (
 <italic class="italic">a</italic>·N
 <sub class="sub">fish,t</sub>), while the variation of survival of the young due to density-dependent effects (large stock and/or low prey abundance) is taken into account by multiplying by the 
 <italic class="italic">overlap</italic> (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). The value for 
 <italic class="italic">a</italic> was selected in order for the 
 <italic class="italic">overlap</italic> variance to be similar to the observed variance in recruits per spawner (Supplementary methods).
