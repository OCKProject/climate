<p id="Par24" class="p">Since the initial values were unknown, we used values taken from the stable population for this purpose. We estimated the initial values with a 20-year “pre-simulation”. For this we started respectively for AB and TB in 1901 and 1940 with as starting parameters N
 <sub class="sub">fish</sub> = N
 <sub class="sub">plk</sub> = 1 (arbitrary units), m
 <sub class="sub">plk</sub> = m
 <sub class="sub">fish</sub> = 1 (month scale) and s
 <sub class="sub">fish</sub> = s
 <sub class="sub">plk</sub> = 0.25 month. We let the values of N and m change through time following the simulation model as described in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>. The environmental variables used for this 20-years pre-simulation were randomly picked up from the observed pair of winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and temperature values between 1921–2013 and between 1960–2013. We then performed a 1000 step bootstrap to estimate the average N
 <sub class="sub">fish</sub> and N
 <sub class="sub">plk</sub> for the 4 years before 1921 in the AB and 2 years before 1960 in the TB system (the AB fish having a longer life cycle than the TB fish, Fig.
