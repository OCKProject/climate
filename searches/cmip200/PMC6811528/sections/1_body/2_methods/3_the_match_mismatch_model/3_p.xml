 <italic class="italic">Engraulis encrasicolus</italic> and assumptions on spawning time. We considered that the mean spawning date is defined each year as the time (in month) when TEMP becomes &gt;17 °C (see Fig.

 </sup> showing that 50% of the eggs are laid when TEMP reach 17 °C) using a 2
 <sup class="sup">nd</sup> order polynomial model on the monthly TEMP values. We considered that the fish take one year to mature (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>), while we did not put any limitation on the number of reproduction attempts. The maximum age reached was defined by the survival. Considering that the larvae mortality is mainly due to mismatch with their prey (already included in the model) we did not add to the model a mortality term for the immatures (n in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>).
