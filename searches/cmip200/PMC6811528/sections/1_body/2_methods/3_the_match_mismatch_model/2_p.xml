 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). Spawning before mid-February (in month 2.5) was not considered possible due to light conditions in the Barents Sea and was replaced by the average of the 20% lower values (3 occurrences between 1921 and 2060).We considered that the fish take two years to mature from spawning (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). While the capelin is essentially semelparous, we did not limit the number of reproductive events of our generic AB fish. However, the adult survival used was an average of the survival of the reproducing and not reproducing adults (&gt;2 years of age), and the mean life expectancy of our generic species (on average 4 years) was similar to that of capelin.
