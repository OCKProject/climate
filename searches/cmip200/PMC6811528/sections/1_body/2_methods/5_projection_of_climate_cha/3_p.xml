<p id="Par29" class="p">To estimate the change in different temperature variables needed for the projections we used satellite-measured “skin” ocean surface temperature (for AB between 70–73°N and 30–35°E, for TB between Cap Ortegal (43°46′N 7°52′W) and Penmarch Point (47°48′N 4°22′W)) and adjusted the obtained results to the observed measurements (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>). To estimate the changes in NAO we used the normalised difference in sea level pressure between two areas within 90°W–40°E, respectively 20–40°N for “the Azores” and 50–80°N for “Iceland”, for the months of December through March
