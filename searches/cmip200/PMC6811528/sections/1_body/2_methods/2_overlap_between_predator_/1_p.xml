<p id="Par19" class="p">We modelled the changes in abundance of small pelagic fish with recruitment bottom-up controlled by their plankton prey in a match-mismatch relationship. Two populations were modelled; one population represented an Arcto-boreal biome (AB) and the other a temperate biome (TB), Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>. We chose to model small pelagic fish because of their relatively low position in the trophic chain and their relatively short life cycle, making them more sensitive to recruitment variability

 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> and Supplementary Methods). The rational of the assumption is that a high overlap indicates a high possibility of feeding for the predator (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). This overlap changes as a function of the synchrony of the two distributions, which depends on timing of spawning and development rates, as well as the relative abundance of prey to predator
