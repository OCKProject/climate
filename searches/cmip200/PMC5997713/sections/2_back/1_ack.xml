  <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref> in Supplementary Information) for producing and making available their model output. For CMIP, the US Department of Energy’s Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison provides coordinating support and leads development of software infrastructure in partnership with the Global Organization for Earth System Science Portals. We thank the modelers, data processors, and those who developed and maintain the gateways at various institutions that enabled sharing the model data. The model data used in this study were obtained from
