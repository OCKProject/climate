<p id="Par6" class="p">In Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b</xref> the linear trends of scaled reconstructed TAS over the 1956–2005 period are shown, revealing that the observed and reconstructed total linear change are in good agreement in the Decadal ROF and all the Pentadal analyses. Furthermore, the reconstructed trends are almost entirely as a result of the ANT forcing with negligible contribution of NAT forcings to the trends. Examining the trends from the decadal ROF analysis over the 1956–2005 period gives attributable trends (in °C per 50 years given as 5–95% range) for ANT of (0.44, 0.86), for NAT of (−0.01, 0.03), and the best estimate reconstructed trend of (0.43, 0.89) with the CRU observed trend of (0.45, 0.60). For the same period, pentadal averages reveal attributable trends for ANT of (0.36, 0.77) and NAT of (0.0, −0.01) with the CRU observed trend of (0.35, 0.64). Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref> shows the trends attributable to ANT and NAT forcings for the different time-periods, temporal averaging lengths, and observed trends for both observations and clearly reveals that where analysis period includes the 1956–2005 half-century, when ANT forcing is strongest, ANT response dominates over NAT response.
