<p id="Par7" class="p">When we analyse the individual homogeneous zones, we can detect the influence of ANT forcing over the WCIND, IPIND, and ECIND regions for both observational datasets. Additionally, the magnitude of observed trend is almost entirely due to ANT trend in each of these cases (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3a</xref> in the Supplementary Information). The Western Himalayan region (WHIND) has seen the largest rates of warming among all the regions and although responses to ANT and NAT forcings are detected (only for the IITM dataset), ANT forcing contributes to nearly all of the trend. These are robust except for the decadal analysis using the ROF method which fails the residual consistency check. The Residual Consistency Check (RCC; see Supplementary Material for details) - carried out for all 3 methods in each of the individual regions and seasons - tests the hypothesis that model simulated internal variability is consistent with observed (similar to what Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> shows). Unlike the “All Region” case (which includes the spatial dimension also) the individual regions only have 5 decadal time points leading to a situation where there is very little information left to estimate the residual’s variance. When we consider the 100-year long 1906–2005 period also (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3b</xref> in Supplementary Information) we see similar detection of ANT signals in the WCIND, IPIND, ECIND, and WHIND regions. Between 1906–1955 (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3c</xref> in Supplementary Information), the observed trends in each of the regions are smaller and we were unable to attribute these changes to either NAT or ANT forcings. It is therefore clear that most of the changes in annual mean TAS seen in the 100 year period have occurred over the second 50-year period (1956–2005), and that ANT forcing is responsible for almost all of the change.
