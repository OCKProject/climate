<p id="Par8" class="p">We now focus our attention on WCIND and WHIND regions to delve into the seasonality of changes. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4a</xref> shows that, over the WCIND region, ANT forcing is detected for each of the seasons and annual mean irrespective of observed dataset used. Moreover, the effects of NAT forcings are not detected. This is robust across the different methods - except the decadal ROF analysis where the RCC fails for reasons noted earlier. The effects of ANT forcings are detected in the DJF season over the WHIND in the pentadal analysis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4b</xref>). The effects of NAT forcings are also detected but do not make a significant contribution to the annual mean trends and contribute to a slight warming during the MAM and SON seasons. This is also revealed in the reconstructed pentadal time series (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref> in Supplementary Information). The NEIND, NCIND, and NWIND regions have smaller observed trends when compared to the other regions and we were able to detect the ANT forcing effects only when using the CRU dataset (see Fig.S3a in Supplementary Information).
