<p id="Par4" class="p">In order to examine the sensitivity of our results to D&amp;A methodology, we used three variants of regression based optimal fingerprint approaches in our analysis of TAS over the Indian region - Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>
 </sup>, Total Least Squares (TLS)
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>
 </sup>, and Regularized Optimal Fingerprinting (ROF)
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>
 </sup>. In all three methods we regress the observations on to the model simulated signals. We calculate the scaling factors for time-series of individual regions and for a combined “All Region” where we retain the spatial information from the seven homogeneous zones (See Supplementary Information for further details). Note that “All Region” is different from ALLIN we have used previously to denote a spatial average over India. We estimate these regressions separately for three time periods (the 50-year periods 1906–1955 and 1956–2005, and the full 100-year period 1906–2005) and two averaging time-lengths (non-overlapping decadal and pentadal averages).
