<p id="Par11" class="p">When we analyse the “All Region” changes for individual seasons, there are numerous cases where we detect the effects of GHG and OA forcings (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S6a</xref> in Supplementary Information). However, these are not consistent across seasons or observational datasets. The effects of NAT forcings are detected in a handful of cases but do not contribute significantly to the trends. The 100-year 1906–2005 period on the other hand provides the strongest evidence of the combined influence of the GHG and OA forcings irrespective of observational dataset used, particularly through the decadal analysis for all the seasons and the pentadal ROF analysis of the Annual, DJF, MAM, and SON seasons (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S6b</xref> in Supplementary Information). The NAT forcings are also clearly detected in the MAM and JJA (decadal analysis only) seasons although they contribute only a very small negative trend. Over the 1906–1955 period, the small observed trends were found to be due to NAT forcings in the MAM season but are otherwise not detected in any season (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S6c</xref>).
