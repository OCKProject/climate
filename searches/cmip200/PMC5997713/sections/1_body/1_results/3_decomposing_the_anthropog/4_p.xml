<p id="Par12" class="p">In the analysis of individual homogeneous regions, we detect the effects of GHG forcing in the WCIND region with the pentadal analysis for all seasons except the MAM season with some sensitivity to observational dataset used (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S7a</xref> in Supplementary Information). Barring one case, the effects of OA are not detected at all in this region. Over the WHIND region, the effects of GHG and OA forcings are detected in the DJF season for pentadal analysis only (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S7b</xref> in Supplementary Information). The WHIND region also indicates a detectable influence of NAT forcings in the pentadal analysis of Annual, MAM and SON seasons which results in a very small negative trend. The MAM season decadal analysis shows clear detection of the influence of GHG, OA, and NAT forcings for the WHIND. Analysis of the Annual mean TAS in the ECIND region shows that the effect of GHG forcings is detected, but not that of OA or NAT (not shown). In the IPIND, NEIND, NCIND, and NWIND regions we were not able to detect the effects of GHG or OA forcings except in one or two cases.
