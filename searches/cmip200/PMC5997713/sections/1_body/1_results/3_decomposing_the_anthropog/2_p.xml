 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref> shows the results of the three-signal analyses of annual mean TAS over “All Region” for the 1956–2005 period. The scaling factors in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5a</xref> show that the influence of GHG forcing can be detected over “All Region” for both observations and in all cases except pentadal TLS analysis with CRU observations. The effect of OA forcings can be detected in all cases where IITM observations are used but in none of the cases when CRU is used. Although the analysis reveals a detectable NAT signal for many cases, the trend contribution from NAT is minimal as seen in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5b</xref>. The dominant signal in all the cases seen is the positive trend from GHG forcing with the negative trend produced by OA forcings counteracting it. This results in a net positive trend in the reconstructed TAS that closely matches the observed trends. The uncertainty range of scaling factors and trends for GHG forcing are smaller than those for OA and NAT forcings. Moreover the amplitudes of the two anthropogenic signals (GHG &amp; OA) are highly correlated as evidenced by the strong tilt in the marginal uncertainty ellipse (see Fig.
