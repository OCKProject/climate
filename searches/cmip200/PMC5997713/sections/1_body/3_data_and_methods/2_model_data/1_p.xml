 </sup>. While output from nearly 60 coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs) are available in the CMIP5 archives, we utilize output from models that performed piControl (Pre-Industrial control), historicalGHG (GHG forcings only), historicalNat (Natural forcings only), historicalAA (forcings due to anthropogenic aerosols only) and historicalAnt (all forcing due to anthropogenic activities) and historical (combination of all forcings) experiments. The AOGCMs used in this study span a wide range of resolutions and sophistication of physical modeling. Each model experiment may have more than one ensemble member typically generated by initializing a set of runs with different, but equally realistic initial conditions that are distinguished by a unique realization number. We use the subset of models that performed all the experiments listed above and whose output fields included surface air temperature (TAS) and -although these were not analyzed for this study, minimum and maximum surface air temperature (TASMIN and TASMAX respectively) - in order to avoid changing sample sizes.
