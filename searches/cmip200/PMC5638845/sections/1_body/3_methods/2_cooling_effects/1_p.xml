<p id="Par19" class="p">The cooling effect on temperature of individual rainfall event is compared within a week under three different rainfall intensities, i.e., daily rainfall larger than 10 mm, daily rainfall &lt;10 mm but larger than 1 mm, and daily rainfall less than 1 mm but larger than 0.1 mm, respectively. The decrease in temperature is calculated with respect to the day prior to the rainfall event.</p>
