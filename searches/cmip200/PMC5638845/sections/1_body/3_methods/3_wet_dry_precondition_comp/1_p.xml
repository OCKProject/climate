<p id="Par20" class="p">The wet precondition composite requires five consecutive non-precipitating days following a rainfall event (with daily rainfall ≥1 mm). The dry precondition composite requires five consecutive non-precipitating days following prior five consecutive non-precipitating days. The latter five consecutive non-precipitating days in each composite are used to calculate the composite average. Prior five consecutive non-precipitation days in dry precondition are selected to minimize the influence of a preceding rainfall event in consideration of the soil could impact the land–atmosphere feedback at lags between 4 and 8 days after a rainfall event
