<p id="Par13" class="p">The above analyses indicate that if a rainfall event, especially a large episode, is missed in the model, the associated surface temperature decrease would be misrepresented through complex land–atmosphere interactions on different time scales. The initial dry bias acts as the source of the eventual simulated warm bias, which is amplified by other model deficiencies, such as underestimated shallow cumulus and misrepresented soil moisture processes, among others. These results provide strong evidence that one culprit of the systematic warm and dry biases in climate models is likely a combination of the inability of climate models in simulating the strong precipitation events caused by the mesoscale convective systems with other potential model deficiencies. The CUS happens to be located in a region where these convective systems occur more frequently than in other regions

 </sup>. The inherent limitation of current models in capturing these convective systems and the two ingredients of climate regime over the CUS—the mesoscale systems and the strong land–atmosphere coupling—can conspire to create the systematic model biases over the CUS.
