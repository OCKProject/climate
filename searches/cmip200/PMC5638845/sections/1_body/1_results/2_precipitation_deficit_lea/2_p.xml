 </sup> Program. We categorize the daily rainfall into three intensities and examined the associated changes of surface temperature in the subsequent 5 days (see “Methods”). Following a heavy precipitation event, temperature drops quickly and substantially and then recovers gradually (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1a</xref>). The stronger the rainfall, the larger the magnitude of the temperature decrease, and the longer duration of the cooling effect. This suggests that surface temperature following a rain event will be misrepresented if the model could not simulate the precipitation accurately, especially for strong rainfall events. Consequently, the warm bias can stem from a precipitation deficit. After the precipitation events, temperature ultimately recovers, primarily related to the increased net downward radiation (Supplementary Fig.
