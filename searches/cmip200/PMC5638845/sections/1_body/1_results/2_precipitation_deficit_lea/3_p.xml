 </sup>. Some of them organize into squall lines. Notoriously, current GCMs cannot accurately simulate these convective systems due to the fact that the convective parameterizations in the current generation of climate models have not been intended to work well for these systems

 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>, in which we compare the intensity frequency distribution of model daily precipitation at the grid point closest to the SGP site during 1996–2005 with ARM observations. Note that the ARM precipitation has been area-averaged with a similar spatial coverage as a model grid box. The models severely underestimate the rainfall intensity and the occurrence frequency of heavy rainfall events (here defined as daily precipitation ≥10 mm). Heavy rainfall events contribute to 85% of the total precipitation in ARM observation, while the percentage simulated by the models is only 37% ± 15%. Consistent with the previously discussed results of the good and bad models, the good group has relatively larger probability of heavy rainfall occurrence (55% ± 10%) than the bad group (31% ± 18%).
