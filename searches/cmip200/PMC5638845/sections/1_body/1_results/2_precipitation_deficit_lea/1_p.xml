<p id="Par8" class="p">Examination of the seasonal evolution of the temperature and precipitation biases in different CMIP5 models indicates precipitation bias preceding that of temperature. This can be illustrated by selecting two groups of models—the good and bad, based on their performances in historical simulations. The good group includes models with warm and dry bias much less than the MMM bias (on average, −0.3 K for temperature and −0.1 mm d
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> for precipitation), whereas the bad group includes models with biases larger than the MMM biases (on average, 4.8 K and −1.4 mm d
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, approximately two times larger than the MMM biases). The classification is indicated by the circles in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref>, and each group has five models. In the good model composite, the peaks of precipitation deficit and the warm bias occur almost simultaneously from July to August (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b</xref>). By contrast, in the bad group, the peak of precipitation deficit leads the warm bias by about 1 month. The precipitation bias reaches its maximum during June to July, while the temperature bias peaks from July to August (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2c</xref>).
