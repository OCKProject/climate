 </sup>, including soil moisture, relative humidity, and cloud cover that could be strongly impacted by the preceding nocturnal precipitation. To quantify the impacts of different rainfall associated processes on temperature, we utilize the comprehensive variables from ARM best estimate (ARMBE) data archive for detailed analysis. We first compare the diurnal changes in the surface temperature, cloud fraction, and surface energy budget terms between precipitating days and non-precipitating days (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). As shown in the diurnal evolution (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>), the temperature contrast between the different composites peaks during daytime with the value to be 4.8 K (3.4 K if we take the daily average). This indicates that although the reduced temperature in rainy days may partly result from the direct rain evaporative cooling including cold pool associated with the MCS passage, it mainly results from the processes during the daytime. All the daytime radiant and turbulent fluxes are smaller during the precipitating days than those during the non-precipitating days. Clouds play a crucial role in regulating the energy budget given its strong interaction with both solar and infrared radiation. Shallow cumulus, usually occurring during daytime with the growth of the boundary layer and a gradually lifted cloud base under 3 km, has a typical fraction of 10–12% over this area. It strongly impacts the shortwave radiation. The cloud fraction of shallow cumulus is larger than 15% during precipitating days while it is about 5% during non-precipitating days (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4a, b</xref>). The total cloud fraction is about two times larger in precipitating days compared to non-precipitating days. This leads directly to a reduction in net shortwave absorption of 107.2 W m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> with 32.4 W m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> smaller net longwave emission. The net reduced radiative heating (74.8 W m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>) is approximately balanced by the decreased latent heat (37.9 W m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>) and sensible heat (36.1 W m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>) fluxes (the residual ground heat flux term is usually small relative to other components). We further divide precipitating days into three categories by intensity (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>). The average differences of nocturnal precipitation amounts correlate well with the correspondent daytime temperature changes with 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = −0.92 (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05), indicating that the larger the nocturnal precipitation, the larger daytime temperature drop. And consistent with Phillips and Klein
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>
 </sup>, the net shortwave radiation decreases quasi-linearly with increasing cloud fraction while a highly positive correlation between the net surface longwave fluxes with cloud cover is found. Sensible and latent heat fluxes vary inversely with cloud fraction (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>). Switching the averaging periods does not change the conclusion. As a result, on a diurnal time scale, the daytime temperature drop in rainy days is predominately associated with the reduced solar radiation.
