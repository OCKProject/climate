<p id="Par12" class="p">During the following days after a rainfall event, however, the inherent complexities in land–atmosphere interactions might make these processes more complicated. For instance, soil moisture is proved to have profound impacts on land–atmosphere interaction due to its long memory

 </sup>. To quantify impacts of rainfall on temperature in the following days, we contrast the surface energy terms between two composites: a wet precondition composite requiring five consecutive non-precipitating days following a rainfall event and a dry precondition composite requiring five consecutive non-precipitating days following prior five consecutive non-precipitating days. The prior five consecutive non-precipitating days in dry precondition composite are adopted here to minimize the influence of preceding rainfall events (see “Methods”). This classification makes the two composites independent of each other and thus enables us to quantify the rainfall impact on temperature. Compared with dry precondition, surface temperature after the rainfall is about 2.8 K lower under wet precondition, which, from the surface energy budget, is primarily associated with the enhanced latent heat fluxes (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref>). Larger cloud fraction is noted under wet precondition, particularly, shallow cumulus is more prevalent due to the strong coupling with soil moisture (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4c</xref>). In contrast, shallow cumulus is rather limited under dry precondition (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4d</xref>). This indicates that soil properties and land surface processes after the rainfall infiltration can indirectly regulate the subsequent low cloud formation. These features are also evident in the evolution of other variables in the surface energy budget (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref>). Low clouds gradually decrease to a level (~5%) similar to that in the dry composite 3 days after a rainfall event. This is likely due to the subsequent gradual evaporative drying of the soil in the absence of additional precipitation. One thing worth noting is that despite the larger cloud fraction under wet precondition, there is more downward solar radiation near the surface (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref>). This lies in the seasonal variation of the solar insolation at the top of the atmosphere. It decreases progressively from June to September. And wet precondition composite has larger proportion in June (28.6%) than dry precondition composite (6.8%). In fact, the scaled surface downward shortwave radiation increases gradually to that under dry precondition, consistent with the evolution of cloud fraction (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3e</xref>). These results imply that except the immediate temperature drop on rainy days, such an impact could last for several days in the aftermath of a precipitation event due to the land–atmosphere interaction mediated by soil moisture. Other properties, like the lower atmosphere’s aerodynamic resistance and humidity saturation deficit, could complicate the strength of land–atmosphere coupling
