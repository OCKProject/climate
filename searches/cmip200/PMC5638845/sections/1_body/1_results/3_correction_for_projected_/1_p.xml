<p id="Par14" class="p">How would the identified systematic biases impact future projections of climate change in CUS? We calculate the projected CUS-averaged temperature and precipitation change over the 20 years at the end of 21st century in all the three RCP scenarios relative to the 20 years at the end of 20th century in historical simulation (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">4</xref>). The projected temperature and precipitation change vary greatly among these models with an overall warming and drying. On average, taking RCP8.5 scenario as an example, model projected warming is nearly 6 K with a slight drying about 0.2 mm d

 </sup>. An important question is how these biases may affect the climate change projections. We start with the temperature bias since the model temperature changes are relatively consistent among the models. Given a model with a systematic warm bias, future warming can be assumed to be the sum of one related to the radiative forcing and the other induced by the bias itself. To estimate the impact of model systematic warm bias on future projections, we regress the projected temperature change with the identified systematic biases. We note robust linear relationships between temperature bias and its future projected change in all three RCP scenarios (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>), with linear regression coefficient to be 0.27, 0.31, 0.41 and

 </sup> (but is included here for completeness). This suggests that a model with a large historical warm bias is likely to overestimate the projected warming. Taking the linear regression as a proof of concept, the intercept at a zero bias in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref> represents the best multi-model estimate of the warming, and the slope describes a scaling factor of the extra warming that would result from the systematic bias. The increased slope with increased radiative forcing in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref> demonstrates that the systematic warm bias in the historical simulations will be proportionally amplified with the magnitude of the overall warming. The slope for the three RCPs (0.27, 0.31, and 0.41) corresponds well with the best multi-model estimate of warming (1.20, 2.43, and 5.16 K). The dependence of the slope with temperature is about 4% per degree of warming (
