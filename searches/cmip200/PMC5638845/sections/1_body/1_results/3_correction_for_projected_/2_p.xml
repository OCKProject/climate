<p id="Par15" class="p">Based on the robust relationships between future warming and the identified present-day warm bias, we are able to make use of this linearity to empirically correct the potential uncertainties in the projected warming (see “Methods” for details). As expected, this procedure leads to decreased warming accompanied by reduced inter-model spread simultaneously (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6a</xref>). The temperature correction results in a mean reduction of warming by 0.7 K and a reduced inter-model spread after the correction, implying a convergence in their warming projections. The overall improved model agreement indicates more confidence in the future projections. In terms of the future projected temperature, which is more relevant for the public, the model systematic bias needs to be considered. Taking RCP8.5 scenario as an example, after both corrections, the future MMM projected temperature will be 28.0 °C instead of 30.5 °C (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6b</xref>). Without the corrections, current GCMs are likely overestimating the future projected temperature over the CUS due to the inherent systematic bias associated with model physics. Overall, the corrections not only substantially narrowed the intermodel differences of the projected future climate, but also altered the quantitative nature of future changes.
