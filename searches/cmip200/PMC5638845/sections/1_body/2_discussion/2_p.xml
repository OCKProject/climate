<p id="Par17" class="p">To conclude, most climate models suffer from systematic biases. This work aims to better understand the cause of the warm/dry bias over the CUS during summertime, which is highly coherent among the latest GCMs. Our investigation suggests that the cause for the identified warm/dry bias is likely triggered by the precipitation deficit arising from the model’s failure in capturing the large precipitation events, followed by strong and complex land–atmosphere interactions on different time scales. Other model deficiencies, such as underestimated shallow cumulus and misrepresented soil processes, may also initiate or reinforce the warm and dry bias, but the deficiency in the large precipitation events in models is at least one of the leading causes of the bias.</p>
