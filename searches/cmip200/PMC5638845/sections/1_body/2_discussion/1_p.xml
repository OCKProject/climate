<p id="Par16" class="p">As expected, the situation for precipitation change is more complicated without a distinct dependence on precipitation bias (correlations are not statistically significant for the three RCPs, Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">4</xref>) and warrants further investigation. However, if we assume the correspondence between precipitation bias and temperature bias (as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref>) still holds in the future, we can adjust precipitation changes based on the temperature correction we proposed. There is no reason to think of this assumption as invalid. After the correction, models projected a slight wetting instead of drying for all three RCP scenarios (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">5a</xref>). The original MMM projection in RCP8.5 is about 2.5 mm d
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, which is substantially drier than the historical observation (3.48 mm d
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> averaged over the period 1980–1999). After further considering the systematic dry bias, the adjusted MMM is 3.51 mm d
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">5b</xref>), indicating a negligible increase of future summer precipitation over the CUS. We believe that the adjusted projections are more credible than the default projections considering the large inherent model systematic bias over this region. This can have important implications for appropriate decision makings and adaptation guidance.
