<p id="Par3" class="p">Well-planned adaptation and mitigation policies require reliable information on how future climate changes. However, despite decades of efforts to improve model performances, systematic biases still exist over highly populated regions on continental scales in the majority of climate models

 </sup> which is likely to remain so for years to come when results of climate models are directly used. Identifying the origins of these systematic biases and determining their potential impacts on future climate changes are thus immensely important and crucial for adaptation guidance and policy making. This topic is currently the subject of intense research in the climate community. For example, in the most recent round of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), understanding and reducing model systematic biases is one of the three major tasks of the community effort
