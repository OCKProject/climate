<p id="Par4" class="p">Among the model biases, one of the most conspicuous is the warm and dry bias over the central U.S. (CUS) in the summer (June–August) that has persisted in many generations of regional and global climate models

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>
 </sup>. Soil moisture deficit and the resultant underestimated shallow cumulus can lead to an excess of surface temperature and, meanwhile, reduce the formation of precipitation. Though these feedbacks have been extensively discussed, the origins of the model biases are still unclear. More importantly, a warming and drying future is projected over the CUS by current models

 </sup>, which has been widely recognized to have significant socioeconomic and agriculture impacts

 </sup>. Given the large warm and dry bias over this region, our confidence in the model projections is overshadowed by potential uncertainties. How the warm and dry bias impact future climate projections remains unknown and needs to be evaluated. Here we identify that the warm and dry bias over the CUS in GCMs is likely triggered by the precipitation deficit arising from the model’s failure in capturing the large precipitation events, followed by land–atmosphere feedbacks. We make use of the robust linear relationship between the projected warming and the present-day warm bias to correct the future projections of temperature. The future projected precipitation is empirically corrected on the basis of the dependence of warm bias on dry bias. Results show that current GCMs are likely overestimating future warming and drying over the CUS.
