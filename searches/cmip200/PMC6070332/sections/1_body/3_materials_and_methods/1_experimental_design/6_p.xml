<p class="p">We first calculated the average temperature shift associated with each dryness threshold for each pixel. To find the temperature shift between periods, we calculated the difference between the temperature averages associated with the two periods. We used the U.S. Drought Monitor classification scheme (
 <italic class="italic">D</italic>
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>, 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic>
 <sub class="sub">1</sub>, 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic>
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, etc.) to define the drought severity thresholds. 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic>
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> began with an SPI of −0.5, 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic>
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> began with an SPI of −0.8, and 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic>
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> began with an SPI of −1.3. For instance, for the 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic>
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> threshold, we isolated months that had an SPI value of −0.5 or lower and found the corresponding temperature average. We then summarized the temperature shifts within seven climatically consistent regions in the contiguous United States. For average shifts of relative humidity and VPD between time periods, we used the same dryness thresholds for all pixels.
