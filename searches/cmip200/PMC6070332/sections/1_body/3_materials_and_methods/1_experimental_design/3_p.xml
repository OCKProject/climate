<p class="p">For the model projections, we used the bias-corrected spatially disaggregated (BCSD) downscaled CMIP5 multimodel ensemble under RCP 8.5 at a 0.125° resolution available from the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation website (

The CMIP5 models are the most recent internationally coordinated collection of climate models used to estimate historical observations and project how the climate will change in the future (
