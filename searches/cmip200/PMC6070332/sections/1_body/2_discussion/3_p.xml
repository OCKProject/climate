<p class="p">The accuracy of our observations and model projections limits our interpretations of the findings. In some areas, the CMIP5 models may have inconsistent physical interpretations since representations of land surface and atmospheric interactions vary across models. Although the models capture large-scale temperature patterns, extreme precipitation events are still not adequately represented (

The known errors in the CMIP5 output prevent us from drawing concrete conclusions from the differences between the observations and the projections.
