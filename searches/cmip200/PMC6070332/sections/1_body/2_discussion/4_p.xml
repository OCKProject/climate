<p class="p">Observations show that amplified temperature shifts have been occurring under drought conditions relative to temperature changes occurring under average climate conditions in the southern and northeastern regions of the United States. The spatial pattern of the drought-conditioned temperature shift can largely be associated with observed shifts in atmospheric moisture content such as relative humidity and VPD. Although we cannot define which variable is the driver at this temporal scale, both temperature and moisture shifts are interacting and amplifying under drought conditions. Projections show that droughts will be significantly warmer than average conditions across the southern region of the United States and are also associated with modeled shifts in relative humidity and VPD. This study highlights the importance of atmospheric moisture in the absence of precipitation in driving changes in the energy and hydrologic cycles.</p>
