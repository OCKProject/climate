<p class="p">The Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) and Studentâ€™s 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> tests revealed statistically significant differences between the shifts seen from average temperatures and those seen under the

 <sub class="sub">0</sub> threshold in the two observational periods in all regions. The K-S test also showed statistically significant differences between the average temperature and

 <sub class="sub">0</sub> threshold shifts in comparing the future projections relative to the modeled past. 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic> testing showed that all regions, except the northwest, show statistically significant differences between the dry and average temperature shifts. The statistical tests highlight that all amplified temperature shifts occurring under drought conditions in the observations and models are significantly different from temperature shifts occurring under average climate conditions.
