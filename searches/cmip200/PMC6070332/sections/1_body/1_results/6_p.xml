<p class="p">As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1B</xref>, the spatial pattern of temperature change does not coincide with the north-to-south gradient of latitudinal heating predicted under the representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenario. Instead of the north experiencing greater shifts in comparison to the south, our results display the opposite pattern. The spatial patterns where amplified shifts in temperature are projected to occur can also be seen in the patterns in relative humidity and VPD. CMIP5 ensembles have predicted changes in water vapor concentrations and changes throughout the hydrologic cycle due to projected climate change, causing shifts in the distributions of precipitation and evaporation around the globe (
