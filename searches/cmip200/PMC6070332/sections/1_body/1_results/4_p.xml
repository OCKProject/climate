<p class="p">We argue that the decreasing availability of regional moisture relative to evaporative demand may be the driving force shaping the spatial pattern of temperature, relative humidity, and VPD changes. Changes in relative humidity and VPD are the physical manifestations of the limits on land evaporation (

 </xref>). The limit on land evaporation will increase the amount of local sensible heat, subsequently leading to a relative warming of the land surface. As we observe in our results, this is amplified during periods of drought. Although observed increases in temperature have increased the upper limit of saturation vapor pressure, the relative lack of available moisture, especially during droughts, limits actual vapor pressure (
