<p class="p">Between the early and late 20th century observations from the Climatic Research Unit (CRU), the southern and northeastern United States experienced greater temperature shifts under dry conditions than the average climate (

 <sub class="sub">1</sub> thresholds contrasted with the warming regions highlighted in the average temperature change panel, indicating that the observed pattern was not temperature-driven. The accelerated warming under dry conditions also does not correspond with regions commonly identified as semiarid or arid. For example, the southern United States experiences a dry climate in the west and a humid climate in the east; however, all southern states experience similar accelerations in warming under dry conditions.
