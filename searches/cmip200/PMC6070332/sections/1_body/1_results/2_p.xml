<p class="p">Around the globe, increasing aridity has been attributed to more rapid increases in evaporative demand relative to precipitation supply (

 </xref>–
 <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">

 </xref>). This increase in aridity has been expressed in decreasing relative humidity and increasing VPD shown in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Figs. 1A</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2</xref> (A and B), we see positive temperature shifts corresponding with decreases in relative humidity and increases in VPD.
