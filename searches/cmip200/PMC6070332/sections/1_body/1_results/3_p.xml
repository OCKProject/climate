<p class="p">We also observe corresponding increases in moisture in regions where temperature shifts under the average climate have outpaced shifts under drought. For instance, in the upper Midwestern region, we see negative temperature shifts relating to increases in relative humidity and decreases in VPD (

 </xref>) recently established that nonrainfall water sources—such as atmospheric moisture—can act as a significant source of moisture in drylands during periods when the relative humidity in the soil is lower than that of the air above. This finding explains the mechanism behind stagnant or cooling temperature shifts under drought conditions with respect to average temperatures. The effect of water vapor on soil moisture (and by proxy, land surface warming) highlights the importance of the general dryness or wetness of the area, which cannot be attributed to a single variable. In all regions, we hypothesize that, during periods of drought, the concurrent shift in atmospheric moisture contributes to the amplification of temperature changes relative to the average climate. Note that, when considering all months, wet or dry, this concurrence does not occur between the variables (see first column in
