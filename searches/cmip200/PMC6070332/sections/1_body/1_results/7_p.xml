 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Figs. 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">4</xref> highlight the differences between the historical observations and model projections. Historically, the northeastern region of the United States shows the amplified drought-associated temperature shift, while CMIP5 models predict a smaller, more muted future shift in temperature with respect to the average climate in the entire upper half of the United States, including the northeast. CRU observations show that the median dry temperature shifts 0.81° higher than the average climate when we isolate regions with amplified temperature shifts. In the CMIP5 projections, the median dry temperature shifts 0.30° higher than the average climate in the regions with amplified temperature change. The shifts quantified in the observations and models show the influence of dry periods on the increasing intensity of climate conditions in the southern United States. These changes occurred for VPD and relative humidity as well.
