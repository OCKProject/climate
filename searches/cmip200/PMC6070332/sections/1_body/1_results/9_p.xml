<p class="p">We also plotted cumulative distribution functions of the temperature shifts under different dryness conditions to illustrate distributional changes between the periods. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">Figure 5A</xref> shows that observed temperatures in the southeastern United States shift to the right under 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic>
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> drought conditions. A shift to the right represents more severe temperature conditions. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">Figure 5B</xref> also shows the modeled temperature distribution under the 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic>
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> condition, increasing the emphasis on warmer months in comparison to the average climate. Distributional plots for the remaining regions reflect the results from the boxplot figures (figs. S2 and S3).
