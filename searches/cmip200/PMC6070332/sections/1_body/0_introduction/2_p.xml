<p class="p">These short-term temperature changes are dependent on the negative and positive feedbacks between the local land surface condition and the atmosphere above (

Moreover, we still do not completely understand the full spectrum of changes that will accompany the simple increase in greenhouse gases, such as compounding extreme events (
