<p class="p">The concurrence of drought and heatwave events has caused severe ecosystem and societal stresses, as witnessed during 2014 in California and 2003 in Europe (

During dry soil moisture conditions, we expect to see associated surface warming, as the available energy will be expressed as sensible heat instead of being evaporated as latent heat, causing the concurrence of these conditions (
