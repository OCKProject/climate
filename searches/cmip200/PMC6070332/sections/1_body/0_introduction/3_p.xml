<p class="p">Here, we examine long-term shifts in temperatures occurring during dry months to further explore feedbacks between surface moisture and temperature conditions (fig. S1). Drawing from established interactions between drying and warming conditions, we study whether temperatures during droughts have experienced changes in the 20th century and whether shifts in dry temperatures will occur under projected climate change conditions. We also evaluate changes in uncertainty that have occurred under observed and projected meteorological drought conditions in comparison to average climate conditions. Because of projections showing droughts and high temperatures intensifying over the next century, the goal of the study is to understand whether temperatures are projected to experience different rates of intensification when coupled with dry conditions. We hope to evaluate whether conditional temperature shifts under droughts are occurring while acknowledging the possible drivers of land surfaceâ€“atmosphere interactions and feedbacks under climate change. We also examine changes in atmospheric moisture to evaluate concurrent shifts in the climate system.</p>
