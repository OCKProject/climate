<p class="p">For this study, we evaluate temperatures during different drought severities in two observed periods (1902–1951 and 1965–2014) and two modeled periods (1951–2000 and 2050–2099) in the contiguous United States. For the observations, we compare the late 20th century to the early 20th century to quantify temperature changes that have already occurred. For the model ensemble, we compare the late 21st and late 20th century periods to investigate future conditions relative to the recent historical past. We defined drought severities on the basis of the U.S. Drought Monitor: with the

 <sub class="sub">1</sub> threshold equivalent to an SPI of −0.8 or lower (see Materials and Methods for further explanation). To evaluate coincident changes under atmospheric moisture conditions, we used relative humidity and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) as quantitative measures of available moisture.
