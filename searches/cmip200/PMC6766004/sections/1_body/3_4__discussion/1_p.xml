<p class="p">Various climate-based models for the suitability of malaria transmission have been proposed around the world in view of climate change for fore-warning and improvement in planning intervention measures [

 <xref rid="B58-ijerph-16-03474" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>]. Fuzzy logic has been used in the field of malaria since 1998 [
 <xref rid="B23-ijerph-16-03474" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. We attempted CORDEX data using fuzzy logic, a soft modeling approach, to map the climate suitability for malaria transmission. Fuzzy sets express how the transition of indices’ suitability from least to most, representing the intensity of suitability, takes place. It offers a better approach to climate suitability classification for malaria transmission than discrete sets. We have generated a Climate Suitability Map for both 
 <italic class="italic">Pv</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Pf</italic> malaria transmission with baseline (1976–2005) and projected 2030s for India using the FCSMT model under the GIS (Geographical Information System) environment, and have projected the changes that are likely to occur in malaria TWs with reference to climate change.
