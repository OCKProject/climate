<p class="p">The physiography of the country has a great role in determining the temperature and humidity distribution, which is reflected in the monthly climate suitability maps for malaria transmission. Climate suitability for more than six months ensures stable malaria transmission [
 <xref rid="B3-ijerph-16-03474" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. In all the southern states, there exists stable climate suitability for malaria transmission, while in northern states monthly suitability decreases considerably from eastern to western parts of the country. Between the two periods (baseline and projected 2030s) for both 
 <italic class="italic">Pv</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Pf</italic> increase in ‘outbreak prone regions’ i.e., for 4–6 months TWs may be registered due to the reduction in ‘stable transmission regions’, and again, 7–9 months of TWs by the 2030s. Meanwhile interior parts of Karnataka, and Telangana are expected to gain 2–3 months of TWs due to a projected increase in temperature in the winter months. Districts in the Himalayan foot hills that are also likely to experience new foci or increase in TWs by 1–3 months, are due to a projected increase in temperature which at present remains below the temperature threshold of malaria transmission. Owing to the variability in temperature as projected during the 2030s, a shift in TWs is also likely in the northern and eastern states. In baseline years, the transmission suitability improves from July onwards and withdraws by October, but in the 2030s scenario, the transmission suitability window extends up to November, thus making these regions vulnerable to prolonged malaria transmission. In short, the projected suitability of malaria transmission by those 2030s in the context of climate change projects the opening of new foci of transmission in the Himalayan region, a change in the length of TWs in most parts of the country including reduction, and a shift in the months of transmission in some regions.
