<p class="p">The near-future malaria transmission patterns, generated from the FCSMT model using one of latest simulated climate database CORDEX and soft partitioning techniques ‘Fuzzy’, have given a broad spectrum of advantages over the projections for malaria transmission that were made in earlier studies [

 <xref rid="B40-ijerph-16-03474" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. First, earlier crisp temperature and RH threshold-based models informed regional climatic suitability in binomial: Yes (1) or No (0); whereas the fuzzy model works on threshold gradation between 0 (least suitable) to 1(most suitable), and thus generates trend-surface maps with third dimensions. The spatial trend-surfaces are indicated by a likelihood of the suitability between 0 (least) and 1 (most), i.e., the closer a region is to value 1, the higher is the suitability intensity, and vise-versa. This is sharply visible for the month of November, where in central India the climate-based transmission suitability is likely to be at its peak during the projected 2030s, while it is weak during baseline. Second, monthly transition of climate suitability (temperature and RH) maps from most to least across the country gives a detailed visualization on the projected changing pattern of malaria transmission. Third, month-wise gradual changes in the climate-based transmission suitability index within the district not only helps in defining the enhancement or reduction in months of TWs at better resolution, but also assists in identifying areas within the district as potential new foci. Fourth, regions with possible reduction in TWs in the projected 2030s have also been identified, which are likely to the possibility of less than six months of transmission and thus suitable for outbreaks of malaria.
