<p class="p">The discussion can further be enriched with an attempt to corroborate the present malaria trend in India with the FCSMT model’s projected outcomes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-03474-f007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref>). The western states like Rajasthan (Barmer, Bikaner and Jaisalmer districts) that have less than four months of TWs, have often experienced an outbreak. Malaria seasonality of Saharanpur and Khushinagar, lying at the two extremes of Uttar Pradesh, also corroborates the length of TWs available for transmission, with no change in the number of TWs during the projected 2030s. The situation is similar in Assam and Andaman-Nicobar Islands, where the region is climatically stable and cases are registered throughout the year with peaks during monsoon months. In southern states, stable climate suitability prevails here too, the graphs for Dakshin Kannada (Karnataka), Prakasham (Andhra Pradesh) and Ramanathapuram (Tamil Nadu) show that cases are registered throughout the year, however, their incidence is low. The region has less than 2 API, and even few districts with 0 API. It shows the predominance of the physiographic complexity of the region in terms of soil type, surface gradient, hydro-geology and land use pattern, over climatic suitability. One important fact has to be accentuated that the potential geographic distribution of climate suitability in the study does not directly translate into an actual malaria case scenario. Striking examples are southern states and the state of Punjab. In southern states, the temperature remains mostly between 28 °C and 34 °C, and in spite of climate suitability for 10–12 months, malaria incidence remains low.
