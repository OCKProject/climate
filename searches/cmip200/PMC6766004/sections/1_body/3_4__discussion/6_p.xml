<p class="p">Moreover, the climate suitability for district Jaisalmer in Rajasthan shows that except for September, all its months blocked for transmission owing to temperature &gt; 34 °C and RH &lt; 40% in both scenarios, however, the cases occurring from August to October (

Otherwise, the CORDEX data-based FCSMT model has efficiently mapped the climatically vulnerable areas of malaria transmission in response to climate change in India. Through the fuzzy-based transmission suitability mapping, month-wise gradual change in the suitability index from least to most within the district has been highlighted, along with the identified few ‘new foci’ for malaria transmission during the 2030s. This soft partitioning approach of malaria transmission suitability mapping has dissolved the crisp boundaries generated from conventional hard classifiers, making the suitability results more close to the reality. Further, in view of the launch of a malaria elimination program in India [
 <xref rid="B31-ijerph-16-03474" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>], the gradual increase in malaria outbreak-prone areas due to a reduction in malaria would also necessitate an early warning system for the detection of outbreaks. The projected new foci need health education in the vulnerable communities.
