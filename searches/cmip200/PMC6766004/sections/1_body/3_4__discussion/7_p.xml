<p class="p">The limitations of the study include: (i) The projected outcome of the FCSMT model are based upon only two climatic parameters (Temperature and RH), and (ii) the certainty of the projected scenario may largely be affected by strengthened intervention measures guided by micro-stratification for malaria control, ecological changes and socio-economic conditions, etc. The outcome of the model can further evolve if intervention measures are included in it. In this study, only the CORDEX model has been used, warranting the need for other climate models as well as epidemiological or vector distribution models for comprehensive conclusions.</p>
