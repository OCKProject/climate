<p class="p">Malaria is still a major public health challenge in India, where around one million cases are reported annually [
 <xref rid="B1-ijerph-16-03474" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. One of the major reasons for the persistence of malaria is the extensive geographic and climatic diversity of the country, which supports ideal ecological conditions for sustaining the parasites and their vectors. Studies have found that the spatial limits of the distribution and seasonality of malaria are sensitive to the seasonal characteristics of climatic factors [

 <xref rid="B4-ijerph-16-03474" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. The major climatic determinants of malaria are temperature, rainfall and humidity [

 <xref rid="B10-ijerph-16-03474" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Hence, the threat of climate change is expected to have a profound effect on the mosquitoâ€™s longevity, development of malaria parasites in the vectors, and consequently opening the windows of malaria transmission particularly in areas which are free due to temperature constrains. In other words, global climate change is likely to alter the spatial and temporal distribution of malaria.
