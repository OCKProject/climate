<p class="p">Prior studies suggest that climate change will increase the opportunities for malaria transmission in traditionally non-malarious areas, and make it difficult to control in traditionally malarious areas due to an alteration in their growth cycle and transmission seasons [

Although it has been recognized that the direct and indirect effects of climate change depend upon the populationâ€™s ability (social, economic and political environment) to cope with and respond to disease burdens, the impacts of future climate change on malaria transmission cannot be ignored [
