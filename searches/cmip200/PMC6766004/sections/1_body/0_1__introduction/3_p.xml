<p class="p">The future repercussions of climate change on malaria transmission at the global level have already been explored; however, such evidences are limited in India. In India, climate suitability models for malaria transmission were developed mainly by considering the Temperature and Rainfall variables [

 <xref rid="B22-ijerph-16-03474" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] had projected the climate suitability of malaria transmission with respect to climate change by the year 2030. These regional models were developed on traditional threshold-based hard partitioning. Soft partitioning approaches like Fuzzy logic-based climate suitability models have been applied to define suitable and unsuitable areas for malaria transmission in many studies [

While resolving the uncertainty in defining distinct thresholds of most suitable to least suitability, the present study adopts the soft partitioning approach using Temperature and RH to map potential malaria transmission vulnerability in the context of climate change. Hence, a Fuzzy-based Climate Suitability Malaria Transmission (FCSMT) model using CORDEX (Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment) data is generated with the objective of identifying climate-based

Resultant maps would guide the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) in addressing the early preparedness to eradicate malaria. The near-future projected malaria transmission scenario in the present study is limited to the 2030s for two reasons: One, climate sensitivity uncertainty increases in the long term projections; and two, this study is an initiative towards the Government of India’s National Framework for Malaria Elimination in India 2016–2030 Program [
