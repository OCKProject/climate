<p class="p">The diverse geography of India is characterized by a subtropical monsoon climate. Therefore, to model the climate suitability map for malaria transmission, multicollinearity among temperature, rainfall and RH for 2010, 2011 and 2012 IMD data were assessed. It shows that rainfall and RH are the two predictor variables that are highly correlated (r = 0.8, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Thus, both the predictors have a similar effect upon malaria transmission under suitable temperature conditions. Unlike RH, Rainfall pattern (number of rainy days etc.) and quantity is highly variable across the country, and has a lag period effect on malaria transmission [
