<p class="p">The CORDEX South Asia dataset includes dynamically downscaled projections to remove systematic error (called bias) and provide a set of high resolution (50 km) regional climate change projections. For the near future projection scenario of the 2030s, Near-Air-surface Temperature and RH, MPI-M-MPI-ESM-LR_MPI-CSC-REMO2009 and MPI-M-MPI-ESM-LR_SMHI-RCA4-simulated climate data models RCP 4.5 scenario, respectively were used. RCP 4.5 corresponds to a low stabilization scenario, and represents the realistic range from a reduction of GHG emissions in the near-term future [

 <xref rid="B37-ijerph-16-03474" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. Increase of global mean surface temperatures under RCP 4.5 is projected to be between 1.1 °C and 2.6 °C (high confidence) until the end of this century with respect to 1986–2005 [

 <xref rid="B35-ijerph-16-03474" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>] and was, therefore, chosen for the present study. The projected increase in temperature by the 2030s is expected to be 1.7–2 °C. The CORDEX South Asia RCM data sets were downloaded from Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) Data Node. The other secondary datasets used during model formulation and analysis are observed meteorological data (temperature, rainfall and RH) 2010–2012, and malaria epidemiological data 2013–2017, procured from the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD, Pune) and NVBDCP, respectively.
