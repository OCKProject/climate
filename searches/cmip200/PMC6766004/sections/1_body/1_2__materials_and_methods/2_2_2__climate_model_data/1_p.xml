<p class="p">District wise monthly Temperature and RH data for Baseline years (1976–2005) and its near future projection scenario of the 2030s (2021–2040) were extracted from CORDEX South Asia (domain WAS-44i). The near-future projection has an advantage of a minimum climate sensitivity uncertainty that increases in long term projections [
