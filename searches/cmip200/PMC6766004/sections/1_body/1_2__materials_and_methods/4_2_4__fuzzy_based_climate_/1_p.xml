<p class="p">The FCSMT model includes six stages: 1. Generation of monthly interpolated temperature and RH maps for both the periods i.e., Baseline (1976–2005) and projected by 2030s (2021–2040); 2. Determination of fuzzy membership functions for both indices; 3. Creation of fuzzy-monthly temperature and RH suitability maps; 4. Month-wise generation of climate suitability maps for each period; 5. Generation of TW’s-based climate suitability map for both period; and, 6. Generation of ‘climate suitability change map’.</p>
