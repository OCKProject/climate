The ‘Composite climate suitability map’, representing the length of transmission windows (TWs), was generated by compiling monthly suitability maps for both baseline and projected 2030s scenarios. A ‘climate suitability change map’ between baseline and projected by 2030s were generated for visualizing the spatio-temporal changes in the length of the TWs, and to identify the new foci of malaria transmission due to climate change.
