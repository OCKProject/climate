 <xref rid="B43-ijerph-16-03474" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>] interpolation algorithm was applied to further downscale the climate data to a 10 km resolution, the data were later classified into fuzzy subsets by fuzzy membership functions. Fuzzy set theory attempts to generate a consistent representation of an inconsistent reality [
 <xref rid="B44-ijerph-16-03474" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>], where the fuzzy membership function (Î¼) is a curve that defines the degree of belongingness between 0 and 1 [
 <xref rid="B45-ijerph-16-03474" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. Unlike threshold-based models, fuzzy-based models have an advantage over information or data loss by making it a prime candidate for inclusion in a model during classification.
