Previous studies suggest that temperature ranging between 18 °C and 32 °C is required for

Regarding RH, the ‘most suitable’ range for transmission is between 55 and 80 percent, while, the lower and upper threshold, which are though poorly delineated so far, are taken as 40 and 95, respectively, on the basis of: 1. Vector survival is least at RH less than 40% [

Since, we have considered the ‘most suitable range’ for defining temperature and RH suitability thresholds; ‘sinusoidal membership function’ was selected. This function is characterized by four scalar parameters, a, b, c and d. Defined as (
