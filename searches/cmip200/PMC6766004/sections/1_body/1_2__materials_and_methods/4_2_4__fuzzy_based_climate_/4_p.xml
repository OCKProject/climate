<p class="p">For the temperature index, ‘a’ represents the lower threshold (18 °C for

Similarly, for RH scalar parameters a, b, c and d are 40, 55, 80 and 95, respectively, where the membership function for the range 55% and 80% is 1 as ‘most suitable’, and as the value moves away from the range towards 40% or 95%, the membership function decreases to 0, representing ‘least suitable’ (
