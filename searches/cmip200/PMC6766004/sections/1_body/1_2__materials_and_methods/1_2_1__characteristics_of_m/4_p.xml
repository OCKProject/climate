 <italic class="italic">Plasmodium vivax</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Plasmodium falciparum</italic> are the main malaria parasites, though 
 <italic class="italic">P. malariae</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">P. ovale</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. knowlesi</italic> have also been recorded, but rarely. 
 <italic class="italic">P. vivax</italic> accounts for around half of all malaria cases in the country. As per the available data of 2014, a high Annual Parasite Incidence (API &gt; 5) was found in most of the districts of Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Odisha and north-eastern states of India; and a few districts of Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Gujarat (

 <italic class="italic">Pv</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-03474-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>B), probably because of the phenomenon of relapse/reinfection. The states of Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Odisha located in the eastern part are the predominant states for the 
 <italic class="italic">Pf</italic> burden, of which the state of Odisha alone shares nearly 50% of this 
 <italic class="italic">Pf</italic> burden of the country. The high burden states have the presence of two vectors (
 <italic class="italic">An. culicifacies</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">An. fluviatilis</italic> in the eastern part, while 
 <italic class="italic">An. minimus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">An. dirus</italic> in northeastern states).
