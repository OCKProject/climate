<p class="p">In India, the distribution of vectors and malaria endemicity largely depends on the physiographic, climatic, eco-epidemiology and socio-developmental conditions and varying from area to area. The northern part of the country is characterized by a subtropical climate and increase in altitude towards north, and has high variation of temperature between summer and winter with only a brief rainy season, providing suitable RH for a shorter period. The southern part of India has a tropical climate and is surrounded by seas; the temperature varies little throughout the year, and receives significant SW and NE monsoonal rains. The northeastern states are characterized by the Himalayan ranges receiving heavy annual rainfall (&gt;2000 mm), a most conducive temperature, and thus stable malaria transmission. The western states, particularly Rajasthan, Gujarat and parts of Karnataka, are mainly plain areas, receive scanty rainfall (&lt;1000 mm), and are prone to malaria outbreaks.</p>
