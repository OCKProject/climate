<p class="p">Monthly climatic suitability maps (combining temperature
 and RH) for

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-03474-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-03474-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>) show that the northern half of India remains least suitable for malaria transmission in both baseline and projected periods during first six months of the year. The low temperature (below malaria transmission threshold) during the winter months (December, January and February) and high temperature with low humidity (exceeding upper malaria transmission thresholds) during the summer months (March, April and May) are the barriers here. With the onset of the monsoon in the June month, the transmission suitability improves, thereby between July and October about 80% of the country becomes suitable for 
 <italic class="italic">Pv</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Pf</italic> transmission at different suitability scales. The trend remains the same in both baseline and 2030s scenario with some exceptions as projected in the 2030s: 1. Late onset of malaria transmission suitability during monsoon in the Indo-Gangetic plains of India, as the onset of transmission suitability shifts from July to August; 2. Enhancement in malaria transmission suitability during December, January and February months in Southern states of India; 3. Improvement in intensity of transmission suitability in Central and Eastern states between September and November, and 4. For P
 <italic class="italic">v</italic> malaria transmission, a one month window has expanded in the month of November in most of the Central and Southern states. All these projected outcomes indicate the shifting and extension of malaria transmission windows (TWs).
