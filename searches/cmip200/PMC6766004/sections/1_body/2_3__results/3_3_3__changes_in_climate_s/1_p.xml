<p class="p">The climate suitability change map (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-03474-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>) depicts the changes in number of months of TWs (new foci/extension/reduction) projected to occur by the 2030s as compared to our baseline year. The major changes are: 1. Some areas in a few districts of the western Himalayan states like Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, are likely to have new foci of transmission (
 <xref rid="ijerph-16-03474-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>); 2. In other Himalayan states like the northern parts of West Bengal, Bihar and Sikkim, a spatial extension of TWs by two months within the districts is more likely; 3. All of the foothill blocks/circles of the Arunachal Pradesh districts are projected to gain up to three months of 
 <italic class="italic">Pv</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Pf</italic> malaria TWs, the highest being the Wakro, Chowkham and Tezu circles of the Lohit district with seven months. 4. Few districts in Rajasthan, Punjab, Gujarat, Maharashtra and West Bengal are also likely to experience nearly two months gain in P
 <italic class="italic">v</italic> malaria TWs, 5. Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Telangana, Odisha, Karnataka and West Bengal are also likely to experience an increase in nearly two TWâ€™s months for 
 <italic class="italic">Pf</italic> malaria transmission; 6. Coastal districts of Maharashtra, Odisha, Goa and West Bengal are also likely to become suitable for 
 <italic class="italic">Pf</italic> malaria transmission; and, 7. Rest of the districts in the states of Haryana, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu are projected to experience reduction in number of months of TWs.
