<p class="p">The generated composite climate suitability maps for malaria transmission (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-03474-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>) show the spatial distribution of TWs (no. of months) across the country for both 
 <italic class="italic">Pv</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Pf</italic>. For both the 
 <italic class="italic">Pv</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Pf</italic> malaria, the spatial extent of TWs of 4–6 months and 10–12 months are projected to increase by 2030s. This may result in shifting of some 
 <italic class="italic">Pf</italic> areas in the northwestern part of India from 4–6-months category to 1–3 months and some areas in the central part of India from the 7–9 months’ category to the 4-6 months’ category of TWs. Eastern coastal belt, mainly Odisha and West Bengal, are projected to experience increased TWs for 
 <italic class="italic">Pv</italic> malaria transmission by the 2030s.
