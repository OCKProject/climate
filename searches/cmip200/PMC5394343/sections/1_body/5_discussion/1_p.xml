<p class="p">In this study, we show that a comparison of the observed and CMIP5 multi-model-simulated time series of March NH SIE anomalies alone is insufficient for understanding the cause of the observed winter NH sea ice declining trend over the satellite period. Closer inspection of spatial patterns of NH SIC trends reveals that the CMIP5 externally forced March NH SIC trend in individual regions differs substantially from that observed. The CMIP5 externally forced response in March NH SIC displays a much weaker decline in regions where the observed decline is most pronounced (Barents Sea). It also exhibits a weak declining trend over a broader region in the NH, and thus opposite to the observed increasing trend in central Arctic. Hence, the CMIP5 externally forced response in March Barents Sea SIE exhibits a large discrepancy (that is, a much smaller decline) compared to that observed, but the discrepancy is less severe in March NH SIE because the discrepancies in the spatial pattern are partially masked by summing over the entire NH. The large discrepancies in the spatial pattern of March NH SIC trends and in March Barents Sea SIE trend suggest that the observed winter NH sea ice trend over the satellite period cannot be well explained by the externally forced response alone, and that the observed rapid declining trend in winter Barents Sea SIE is not predominantly due to external radiative forcing.</p>
