<p class="p">To our knowledge, our work is the first to use CMIP5 coupled climate models, augmented by extended control simulations, to quantify the relative contribution of external radiative forcing versus internal variability to the observed Barents Sea winter SIE decline. Our results suggest that enhanced HT
 <sub class="sub">BSO</sub> associated with regional internal variability may have played a leading role in the observed decline in winter Barents Sea SIE over the satellite period. Further studies are needed to provide additional support for this proposed mechanism. Understanding the leading cause of the observed winter Barents Sea SIE decline over the satellite period is crucial for understanding and predicting the associated broad impacts on high/mid latitude climate and weather, and Arctic ecosystems.
