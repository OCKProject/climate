<p class="p">Our analysis further suggests that an enhanced Atlantic heat transport across the BSO (HT
 <sub class="sub">BSO</sub>) has played a key role in March Barents Sea SIE decline, while the warming in global mean SAT has been relatively unimportant for March Barents Sea SIE decline in individual CMIP5 ensemble members. We identify a significant high anti-correlation between winter Barents Sea SIE trends and HT
 <sub class="sub">BSO</sub> trends throughout individual CMIP5 ensemble members. This suggests that at multi-decadal time scales, changes in HT
 <sub class="sub">BSO</sub> are forcing changes in Barents Sea SIE and in net upward surface heat flux over the Barents Sea in these models. The CMIP5 externally forced HT
 <sub class="sub">BSO</sub> increase is too small to cause the observed decline in winter Barents Sea SIE. Based on CMIP5 results and observations, we estimate that a total 35 TW per 37 years trend in HT
 <sub class="sub">BSO</sub> is needed to explain the observed winter Barents Sea SIE decline over the satellite period. Among this, an increase in HT
 <sub class="sub">BSO</sub> on the order of 30 TW per 37 years due to regional internal variability is necessary to explain the majority of the observed winter Barents Sea SIE decline seen in recent decades and its discrepancies with the CMIP5 multi-model mean forced response. Results from long pre-industrial control simulations of three coupled models show that the simulated March Barents Sea SIC declines in response to a positive trend of HT
 <sub class="sub">BSO</sub> (scaled to 30 TW per 37 years) are much larger than the CMIP5 multi-model ensemble mean forced response and are on the same order as that observed.
