<p class="p">Meanwhile, substantial multi-decadal/centennial variability of Arctic sea ice cover has been inferred from high-resolution multi-century algal proxy
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5" class="xref">5</xref>. Multi-decadal fluctuations in Arctic surface air temperature (SAT) have been found in historical records
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6" class="xref">6</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7" class="xref">7</xref>, and are attributed to reduced sea ice cover due to internal variability of Atlantic inflow
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8" class="xref">8</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9" class="xref">9</xref>. Low-frequency variability in winter Arctic SIE has been shown to be linked to the Atlantic multi-decadal variability in coupled climate models
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10" class="xref">10</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11" class="xref">11</xref>, as well as in historical records and palaeo proxy data
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" class="xref">12</xref>. The rapid decline of summer Arctic SIE in recent decades may be partially due to an enhanced Atlantic heat transport into the Arctic associated with a strengthening of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) since the 1970s
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13" class="xref">13</xref> as indicated by the observed AMOC fingerprints
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14" class="xref">14</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" class="xref">15</xref>. Both the tropical AMOC ‘fingerprint' based on the anti-correlation between surface and subsurface temperature variations in tropical North Atlantic
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14" class="xref">14</xref> and the extra-tropical AMOC ‘fingerprint' based on the leading mode of upper ocean heat content variations in the extra-tropical North Atlantic
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" class="xref">15</xref> suggest that the AMOC has strengthened since the 1970s. The importance of internal variability is further suggested by the fact that the recent rapid decline of summer Arctic SIE took place during a period of only relatively modest global warming
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3" class="xref">3</xref>. The Arctic SIE is also found to be subject to significant internal variability among individual ensemble members of National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) CCSM3 and CCSM4 simulations forced by identical changes in anthropogenic forcing
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16" class="xref">16</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17" class="xref">17</xref>. On decadal to multi-decadal time scales, internal variability could also temporarily counter changes in anthropogenic radiative forcing and cause a hiatus or pause in the decline of Arctic sea ice
