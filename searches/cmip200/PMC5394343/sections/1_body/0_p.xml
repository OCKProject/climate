<p class="p">The decline of Arctic sea ice over the satellite period has often been attributed in large part to anthropogenic climate warming. Were the observed decline to continue at its recent rate, the Arctic would likely become nearly ice-free during summer within the next decade

It is well known that the simulated multi-model ensemble mean summer Northern Hemisphere (NH) sea ice extent (SIE) decline under increased anthropogenic forcing in the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 (CMIP5) is less rapid than that observed
