<p class="p">Why does the CMIP5 externally forced response account for a substantial part of the observed March NH SIE trend, but only a modest part of the observed March Barents Sea SIE trend (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>)? We interpret this in terms of the discrepancy between observed and CMIP5 multi-model-simulated spatial patterns of March NH SIC trends over the satellite period (1979â€“2015). The observed declining trend in March NH SIC is most pronounced in the northeast section of the Barents Sea (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2a,c</xref>). Beyond the Barents Sea, the observed March NH SIC trend also exhibits significant decline in the Sea of Okhotsk and Greenland Sea, but shows a slight increase in the Bering Sea and central Arctic (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2a</xref>). The observed increase of SIC in the Bering Sea was also found in a previous study
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" class="xref">25</xref>, but is not statistically significant in this analysis with up-to-date data. In contrast, the CMIP5 externally forced response in March NH SIC displays a much weaker declining trend in regions where the observed decline is most pronounced (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2b,d</xref>). It also exhibits a weak declining trend over a broader region in the NH, and thus an opposite trend to that observed in central Arctic (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2a,b</xref>). On the other hand, although the CMIP5 externally forced March NH SIC trends in individual regions differ substantially from those observed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>), the CMIP5 externally forced declining trend in March NH SIE is not much weaker than that observed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1a</xref>) because the discrepancy in the spatial pattern is masked by summing over the entire NH. Hence, simply comparing the time series of March NH SIE anomalies is insufficient for understanding the cause of the observed winter NH sea ice decline. Closer inspection of spatial patterns of NH SIC trends reveals why the CMIP5 externally forced response compares much better with the observed March NH SIE declining trend than with the observed March Barents Sea SIE declining trend (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1a,b</xref>). A better performance in simulating the observed time series of winter NH SIE can be misleading, as the model-simulated spatial structures may differ substantially from observations. Similar results are also found in a previous study showing forced ensemble mean sea ice response from one CMIP5 model
