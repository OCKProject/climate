<p class="p">In this study, we included 79 ensemble members from 32 CMIP5 models (‘Methods' section), and the multi-model ensemble mean represents the response to changes in external radiative forcings in the models, as the internal variability in individual ensemble members tends to cancel out in the multi-model ensemble mean. The CMIP5 multi-model ensemble mean March NH SIE shows a gradual decline over the 37-year period from 1979 to 2015 due to changes in external radiative forcing (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1a</xref>). The observed March NH SIE anomalies and associated trend generally remain within ±1 s.d. of the CMIP5 multi-model ensemble mean except the recent low records since 2005 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1a</xref>). The CMIP5 multi-model ensemble mean March NH SIE declining trend (−1.03 million km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> per 37 years) is weaker than that observed (−1.51 million km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> per 37 years), but still accounts for a substantial part (68%) of the observed declining trend. On the other hand, the observed March Barents Sea SIE declining trend is not well captured by the CMIP5 multi-model ensemble mean. Both the observed March Barents Sea SIE declining trend and anomalies often stay outside of the ±1 s.d. of the CMIP5 multi-model ensemble mean (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1b</xref>). The CMIP5 multi-model ensemble mean declining trend of March Barents Sea SIE during this period (−0.10 million km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> per 37 years) is much weaker than that observed (−0.36 million km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> per 37 years), accounting for only a modest part (28%) of the observed declining trend.
