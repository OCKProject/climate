<p class="p">Despite the weaker than observed declining trends in March NH and Barents Sea SIEs in the CMIP5 multi-model ensemble mean, the annual global mean SAT simulated by the CMIP5 multi-model ensemble mean displays a warming trend (0.86 K per 37 years) stronger than that observed (0.51 K per 37 years) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1c</xref>). Both the observed global mean SAT warming trend and anomalies are often (more than half of the time) outside of the ±1 s.d. of the CMIP5 multi-model ensemble mean (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1c</xref>). Here the annual global mean SAT is a measure of the response to global scale changes in external radiative forcings, which is better represented by global mean SAT than by regional SATs. If we take into account this discrepancy in the externally forced response in global mean SAT warming trend versus observations, the externally forced response in March NH and Barents Sea SIE trends should be adjusted by the ratio 0.51/0.86≈0.59, increasing the discrepancy between the observed March NH and Barents Sea SIE trends even more.
