<p class="p">The CMIP5 individual ensemble members in general seem incapable of simulating a positive HT
 <sub class="sub">BSO</sub> trend on the order of 30 TW per 37 years. The majority of CMIP5 ensemble members have much smaller trends in both HT
 <sub class="sub">BSO</sub> and March Barents Sea SIE (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3b</xref>). Among the three long control simulations, the largest trends of HT
 <sub class="sub">BSO</sub> over all available 37-year segments are 23, 45, and 25 TW per 37 years in the three control simulations (GFDL CM2.1, GFDL CM3 and NCAR CESM), respectively. Even for GFDL CM3, only 38 out of all 3,564 available 37-year segments have such large HT
 <sub class="sub">BSO</sub> trends (⩾30 TW per 37 years), suggesting a rare occurrence. The implications are that either current climate models have unrealistically small amplitudes of low-frequency internal variability in HT
 <sub class="sub">BSO</sub>, or the recent observed decline of March Barents Sea SIE is a remarkably rare event. We speculate that it is more likely that models have unrealistically small amplitudes of low-frequency internal variability in HT
 <sub class="sub">BSO</sub> due to common systematic model deficiencies and mean state biases, rather than that the recent observed decline is a rare event. The underestimation of mean state HT
 <sub class="sub">BSO</sub> is implied from the simulated excessive mean state winter Barents Sea SIE (southward shift of climatological March sea ice edge) in CMIP5 models (
