<p class="p">To further investigate the response of winter Barents Sea SIE to internal variability in Atlantic heat transport across the BSO (HT
 <sub class="sub">BSO</sub>), we seek insights from long-term pre-industrial control simulations that are available from three coupled climate models (GFDL CM2.1, GFDL CM3 and NCAR CESM). As discussed in the previous section, we estimate that an increase in HT
 <sub class="sub">BSO</sub> on the order of 30 TW per 37 years due to regional internal variability is necessary to explain the dramatic decrease of winter Barents Sea SIE seen in recent decades. The simulated March Barents Sea SIC declines in response to a positive trend of HT
 <sub class="sub">BSO</sub> (scaled to 30 TW per 37 years) in all three models due to internal variability (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>) are much larger than the CMIP5 multi-model ensemble mean forced response, and are on the same order as that observed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2c,d</xref>). GFDL CM3 exhibits a spatial pattern closest to that observed with the most pronounced decline of March SIC in the northeast section of the Barents Sea, partially because its climatological March SIC and sea ice edge is more similar to that observed during recent decades (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Figs 2c</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5" class="xref">5</xref>). The control simulations from GFDL CM2.1 and NCAR CESM both have excessive climatological March sea ice in the Barents Sea region, thus the most responsive area of March SIC is displaced towards the southwest section of the Barents Sea (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>). The correlations between 37-year March Barents Sea SIE trends and HT
 <sub class="sub">BSO</sub> trends of 500 randomly sampled 37-year segments from each control simulation are −0.94, −0.96 and −0.91 for GFDL CM2.1, GFDL CM3 and NCAR CESM, respectively, larger than the CMIP5 inter-model correlation (−0.82, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3b</xref>). The regression coefficients between 37-year March Barents Sea SIE trends and HT
 <sub class="sub">BSO</sub> trends are −0.31, −0.55 and −0.25 million km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> per 30 TW for GFDL CM2.1, GFDL CM3 and NCAR CESM, respectively. The response of March Barents Sea SIE trends to HT
 <sub class="sub">BSO</sub> trends in GFDL CM2.1 is about the same as that derived from the CMIP5 ensemble members (−0.31 million km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> per 30 TW, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3b</xref>), while the response is stronger in GFDL CM3 and weaker in NCAR CESM compared to the CMIP5 ensemble.
