<p class="p">There is no significant anti-correlation (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>=−0.2) between annual global mean SAT trends and March Barents Sea SIE trends over the 37-year period across the CMIP5 ensemble members (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3a</xref>). In contrast, March Barents Sea SIE trends are strongly anti-correlated with the trends in the annual mean Atlantic heat transport across the BSO (HT
 <sub class="sub">BSO</sub>) (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>=−0.78, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3b</xref>) over the 37-year period across the CMIP5 ensemble members. The results suggest that an enhanced HT
 <sub class="sub">BSO</sub> has played a key role in the March Barents Sea SIE decline while the warming in global mean SAT appears not important for March Barents Sea SIE decline in individual CMIP5 ensemble members. Furthermore, there is strong positive correlation (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>=0.69) between the trends in annual mean net upward surface heat flux integrated over the Barents Sea region (F
 <sub class="sub">SFC</sub>) and trends in HT
 <sub class="sub">BSO</sub>, and strong anti-correlation (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>=−0.64) between trends in F
 <sub class="sub">SFC</sub> and trends in March Barents Sea SIE, over the 37-year period across the CMIP5 ensemble members. Hence, an enhanced HT
 <sub class="sub">BSO</sub> leads to a reduced winter sea ice cover in the Barents Sea, and more net upward surface heat flux is released into the atmosphere through larger winter open water area in the Barents Sea

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26" class="xref">26</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27" class="xref">27</xref>. Through this mechanism, changes in F
 <sub class="sub">SFC</sub> provide a negative feedback to changes in winter Barents Sea SIE. The positive correlation between HT
 <sub class="sub">BSO</sub> and F
 <sub class="sub">SFC</sub> trends and the negative correlation between F
 <sub class="sub">SFC</sub> and March Barents Sea SIE trends suggests that at multi-decadal time scales, changes in HT
 <sub class="sub">BSO</sub> are forcing changes in Barents Sea SIE and F
 <sub class="sub">SFC</sub> in the models, not the other way around. If the net upward surface heat flux (F
 <sub class="sub">SFC</sub>) were driving the winter Barents Sea SIE changes, one would expect a positive correlation between them (that is, sea ice loss occurs when net downward surface heat fluxes are enhanced), which is opposite to the behaviour simulated in the models.
