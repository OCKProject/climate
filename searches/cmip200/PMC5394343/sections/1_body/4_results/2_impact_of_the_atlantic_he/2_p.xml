 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>). If we take into account the overestimation of the externally forced response in CMIP5 multi-model ensemble mean (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1c</xref>), the externally forced response in HT
 <sub class="sub">BSO</sub> should also be adjusted by the ratio 0.51/0.86=0.59, and the inferred externally forced increase of HT
 <sub class="sub">BSO</sub> over the 37-year period should be 8 TW × 0.59≈5 TW after the adjustment. In comparison, the HT
 <sub class="sub">BSO</sub> increase needed to induce the observed March Barents Sea SIE declining trend over the 37-year period is on the order of 35 TW, as indicated by the least-square linear-fit line of the scatter plot (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3b</xref>). This is consistent with the simulated HT
 <sub class="sub">BSO</sub> increasing trend of ∼35 TW over this period in the decadal prediction experiments initialized with the observed ocean information and the ocean-only simulation forced by observed atmospheric states in a recent study
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19" class="xref">19</xref>. The adjusted CMIP5 externally forced HT
 <sub class="sub">BSO</sub> increase (∼5 TW per 37 years) is thus too small to cause the observed decline in winter Barents Sea SIE (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>). Based on CMIP5 results and the observed March Barents Sea SIE declining trend (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3b</xref>), we estimate that an increase in HT
 <sub class="sub">BSO</sub> on the order of 30 TW per 37 years (that is, 35 TW per 37 years–5 TW per 37 years) due to regional internal variability is necessary to explain the dramatic decrease of winter Barents Sea SIE seen in recent decades, in addition to the externally forced response. Here internal HT
 <sub class="sub">BSO</sub> changes could be affected both by local variability in surface winds through changes in volume transport across the BSO, as well as by remote variability in the large scale ocean circulation, such as AMOC, through changes in both volume transport across the BSO and ocean temperature of the Atlantic inflow.
