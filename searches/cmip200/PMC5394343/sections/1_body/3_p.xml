<p class="p">In this study, we would like to address the following questions: What are the relative roles of changes in external radiative forcing versus internal variability in causing the observed winter Barents Sea SIE decline over the satellite period? Are there any substantial discrepancies between the observed and CMIP5-simulated externally forced response in winter NH sea ice decline, particularly given that the internal variability of Atlantic heat transport into the Arctic is largely removed in the CMIP5 multi-model ensemble mean forced response? The work presented here aims to provide insights on these questions by comparing observations with the CMIP5 multi-model ensemble simulations forced by changes in external radiative forcing as well as with long pre-industrial control simulations under constant radiative forcing. We show that the CMIP5 externally forced winter NH sea ice concentration (SIC) trend in individual regions (especially in Barents Sea) differs substantially from that observed. Our analysis suggests that enhanced Atlantic heat transport into the Barents Sea associated with regional internal variability may have played a leading role in the observed winter Barents Sea SIE decline since 1979.</p>
