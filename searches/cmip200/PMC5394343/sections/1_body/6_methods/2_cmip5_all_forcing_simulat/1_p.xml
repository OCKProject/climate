<p class="p">To compare with the observations, we combined CMIP5 twentieth century all-forcing (historical) simulations with CMIP5 representative concentration pathway (RCP) 4.5 future emission scenario simulations to cover the period from 1979 to 2015. The RCP4.5 pathway is chosen from among the four available future emission scenarios to represent the period after 2005, noting that these scenarios deviate little from each other during the short period 2006–2015. A total of 79 ensemble members from 32 CMIP5 models are selected, based on the criteria that all variables needed in our analyses are available in a selected ensemble member, and that the ensemble member has both historical and RCP4.5 simulations so that the they can be combined. Due to the large number of selected ensemble members, the multi-model ensemble means represent the response to changes in external radiative forcings in the models, as the internal variability in individual ensemble members tends to cancel out in the multi-model ensemble means. In this study, both observed and CMIP5-simulated anomalies are referenced to climatological means for 1979–2015. The correlation between March and November–April averaged Barents Sea SIE trends over the 37-year period across CMIP5 ensemble members is 0.94, and the correlation between March and February–April averaged Barents Sea SIE trends over the 37-year period across CMIP5 ensemble members is 0.99. These confirm that trends in March SIE are representative for trends in the winter SIE in this study. To study the oceanic impact on the Barents Sea winter SIE, we calculated the annual mean advective Atlantic heat transport across the BSO (71° N–76° N, 20° E) (HT
 <sub class="sub">BSO</sub>) using monthly mean ocean velocities and potential temperature (reference temperature being 0 °C) from the selected CMIP5 ensemble members.
