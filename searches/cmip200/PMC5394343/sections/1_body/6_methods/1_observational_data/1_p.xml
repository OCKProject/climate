<p class="p">Here we use the satellite SIC data for the 37-year period (1979–2015) from the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC)
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30" class="xref">30</xref>. We define the NH and Barents Sea SIEs as the total marine area where SIC ≥15% within the NH and within the Barents Sea (70° N–81° N, 15° E–60° E), respectively. The climatological sea ice edge is defined as the 15% climatological SIC contour line.
