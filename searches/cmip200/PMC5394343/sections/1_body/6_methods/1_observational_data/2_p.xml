<p class="p">The observed global mean SAT is derived from the averaged SAT of three reanalysis data sets: NCEP/NCAR
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31" class="xref">31</xref>, ERA-Interim
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32" class="xref">32</xref> and NASA MERRA
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33" class="xref">33</xref>. The annual global mean SAT trends over the 37-year period in three reanalysis data sets are: NCEP/NCAR (0.61 K per 37 years), ERA-Interim (0.46 K per 37 years) and NASA MERRA (0.45 K per 37 years), and the averaged trend of three reanalysis data sets is (0.51 K per 37 years). It has been shown that SAT data in NASA MERRA is most realistic in the Arctic region
