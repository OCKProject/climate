<p class="p">The Barents Sea is located on one of the main corridors of Atlantic inflow entering the Arctic. Strong coupling between winter Barents Sea SIE and the Atlantic heat transport into the Arctic through the Barents Sea Opening (BSO) are found in both observations and modelling studies

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" class="xref">22</xref>. Multi-decadal variability of the Atlantic inflow temperature in the Barents Sea has also been recorded and is correlated with the Atlantic multi-decadal variability

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" class="xref">24</xref>. Recent work also suggests that winter Barents Sea SIE is well correlated with summer Arctic SIE in both coupled climate model simulations and observations, suggesting an important role for enhanced Atlantic heat transport into the Arctic in both winter and summer Arctic sea ice declines
