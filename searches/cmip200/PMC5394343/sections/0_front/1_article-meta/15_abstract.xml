 <p class="p">The relative roles of external forcing versus internal variability in the Barents Sea winter sea ice decline since 1979 remain unconstrained. Here, the authors show that enhanced Atlantic heat transport into the Barents Sea associated with regional internal variability may have played a leading role.</p>
