  <p class="p">(
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>,
   <bold class="bold">c</bold>) Observations (NSIDC), (
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>,
   <bold class="bold">d</bold>) CMIP5 multi-model ensemble mean. The lower panels zoom in over the Barents Sea. Black lines mark the climatological March sea ice edge, and the red box outlines the Barents Sea. SIC from individual CMIP5 models are regridded onto a common polar-stereographic grid so that a multi-model ensemble mean is applicable. Grid points with a mean SIC less than 1% are masked white. In 
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>,
   <bold class="bold">c</bold>, grid points poleward of 85°N are also masked due to missing data. The unhatched regions in all panels have statistically significant trends at 95% confidence level.
