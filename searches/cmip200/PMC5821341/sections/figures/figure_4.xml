  <title class="title">Future climate ensemble map for common vampire bats (
   <italic class="italic">Desmodus rotundus</italic>) in North America using binary predictions from 5 species distribution model approaches projected into 17 downscaled IPPC5 (CMIP5) future climate projections (85 future models; see 
   <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0192887.t004" class="xref">Table 4</xref>) using the 8.5 representative concentration pathway for 2070 (average for 2061–2080).
  </title>
  <p class="p">The grey-scale indicates the proportion of the 85 model predictions that considered a given cell on the map as suitable habitat in year 2070. Black indicates that all of the models predict the area will be suitable habitat, while white indicates that all of the models predict the area will be unsuitable habitat. Three possible routes of vampire bat and vampire-borne rabies dispersal into the ecoregions of the United States are also indicated: (1) via the Western Gulf Coastal Plain (GP) and Southern Texas Plains (TP) ecoregions in the México-Texas borderlands; (2) via Cuba and the Southern Florida Coastal Plain (FP) and Southern Coastal Plain (SCP) ecoregions in south Florida; and (3) via the Mandrean Archipelago (MA) ecoregion in New Mexico and Arizona (this route is not likely through year 2070, given the results of this analysis). Outlines of North American ecoregions are indicated, but only ecoregions associated with possible routes of dispersal are named using a 2 or 3 letter acronym.</p>
