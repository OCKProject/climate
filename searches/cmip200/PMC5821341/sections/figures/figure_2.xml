  <title class="title">Comparison of response curves for the highest-scoring predictor variable, minimum temperature of the coldest month (Bio6; °C) for each of the 5 species distribution modeling approaches used in this analysis of common vampire bats (
   <italic class="italic">Desmodus rotundus</italic>) in North America.
  </title>
  <p class="p">GLM = Generalized Linear Models; MARS = Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines; BRT = Boosted Regression Trees; RF = Random Forest; and Maxent = Maximum entropy. The x-axis is minimum temperature of the coldest month (Bio6) and the y-axis is the estimated probability that a given value for Bio6 will result in suitable habitat for vampire bats, with all other variables in the model held at their mean values. The “Max” value indicated is the temperature at which the probability is maximized using a given SDM approach.</p>
