<p class="p">The purpose of this study was to use multiple species distribution modeling (SDM) approaches (N = 5) to model and map the potential distribution of vampire bats in North America under current and “worst-case” future climate scenarios (N = 17), focusing specifically on the northern limits of the current vampire bat distribution and the México-U.S. borderlands. Our rationale was to develop well-justified and empirically-based hypotheses of the current and future potential distributions of this species, especially in relation to the risk of vampire-borne rabies virus to cattle in the extreme southern United States (such as south Texas). Concerns about vampire-borne rabies can also result in wanton destruction at bat roosts in areas known to be occupied by vampire bats, but also in areas not known to be occupied by this species, which can in turn negatively affect some bat roosts, populations, and species that are of conservation concern [

Thus, a key goal of this project was to better understand the current and possible future distributions of vampire bats so that current and future management activities can be targeted most effectively at appropriate vampire populations, but not adversely influence other bat populations and species of conservation concern. This project is part of a broader research program aimed at better understanding the ecology, population genetics, and fine-scale distribution patterns of vampire bats in northern México. In an attempt to capture the possible current and future distributions of vampire bats, we used five SDM approaches that have performed well in comparative SDM analyses [

These approaches include a classical statistical model (logistic regression within the generalized linear models (GLM) and maximum likelihood framework), but also newer machine learning algorithms, such as random forest and maximum entropy approaches. We developed a set of carefully-chosen predictor variables, then pooled the predictions from each SDM model approach and generated ensemble maps; such ensemble methods often provide better overall prediction when compared to single model approaches [
