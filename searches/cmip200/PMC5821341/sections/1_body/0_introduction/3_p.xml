<p class="p">Recent research suggests that vampire bats readily exploit a variety of prey resources [
 <xref rid="pone.0192887.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>], including livestock and invasive mammals, such as feral pigs [
 <xref rid="pone.0192887.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>], and that males in particular can rapidly disperse in response to newly-available prey resources [
 <xref rid="pone.0192887.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. Although the dispersal distance into the U. S. from currently occupied areas would be relatively short (e.g. from north-eastern México into the southern tip of Texas; &lt; 200 km), some stakeholders are concerned that one or more established populations of vampire bats would represent a novel, invasive colonizer [
 <xref rid="pone.0192887.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>], with the potential to have significant impacts on the new environment and the local agricultural economy. Cattle densities are relatively high in north-eastern México—including in the states of Tamaulipas and Nuevo Leon—and in southern Texas and elsewhere in the south-eastern United States [
 <xref rid="pone.0192887.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. Feral pigs, which are a key food resource for vampire bats in some parts of their range [
 <xref rid="pone.0192887.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0192887.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>], are widespread in the south-eastern U.S., including throughout most of Texas [
 <xref rid="pone.0192887.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Although the economic impacts of vampire bats are difficult to quantify, they are known to weaken cattle due to loss of blood, lead to secondary infections, reduce milk production, and lead to death if cattle contract paralytic rabies [
 <xref rid="pone.0192887.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0192887.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Thus, vampire bats are of concern to livestock industry producers and managers who strive to control the spread of disease among cattle herds. Vampire bats are also of concern to biologists and wildlife managers, due to the destruction of some bat roosts that contain species of conservation concern that were incorrectly thought to contain vampire bats [
