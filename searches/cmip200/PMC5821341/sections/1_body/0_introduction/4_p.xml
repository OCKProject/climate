<p class="p">There are contradictory studies on whether suitable habitat currently exists for vampire bats in the southern U. S., especially in areas with high cattle, livestock, and feral pig densities. Several previous studies have evaluated the potential future North American distributions of vampire bats under the influence of a changing climate. Ceballos et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0192887.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>] suggested that future climate scenarios might result in some parts of the México–U.S. borderlands becoming suitable habitat for vampire bats. Mistry and Moreno-Valdez [
 <xref rid="pone.0192887.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>] concluded that parts of the United States could become suitable habitat in the future, including southern Texas, Louisiana, Florida, and perhaps Arizona and California. Alternatively, Lee et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0192887.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>] concluded that vampire bats will “…not expand into the U.S. through Mexico” through the year 2070 (pp7). Most recently, Zarza et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0192887.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>] analyzed the distribution of vampire bats in México and evaluated the potential impacts of a changing climate on the species; their analysis suggests that suitable habitat for vampire bats will not extend into the U.S. under future climate scenarios. However, each of these previous analyses either: did not explicitly extrapolate models into the United States [
