 <xref rid="pone.0192887.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. The distribution patterns of highly visible species, such as large and diurnal mammals, are usually relatively well-known, but much less is known about the distributions of elusive, nocturnal, or cryptic mammalian species. For example, many species of bat are small, reclusive, and rarely active or easily observable during the daytime. Thus, less is known about the distribution patterns of small, nocturnal bats compared to highly visible and/or gregarious diurnal bats, such as Old World fruit bats (family Pteropodidae). The compilation and analysis of occurrence records in combination with species distribution modeling has been used to address many problems in theoretical and applied ecology, including suggesting sites with high potential for occurrence of rare or cryptic species, and for development of management plans and conservation strategies under current and future climate scenarios [

 <xref rid="pone.0192887.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Several researchers and policy groups have emphasized the value of using currently-available data and quantitative models, such as species distribution models, to evaluate the relationships between areas currently occupied by species of management concern to other geographic areas that may currently represent suitable habitat for a given species, or might become suitable in the future [

 <xref rid="pone.0192887.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>] may be expanding in part due to environmental and climate changes in south and central Europe. Alternatively, some species of management and conservation concern in western North America may be at risk of substantial population declines and contracting distributions as a result of changing climate and water resource conditions [
