<p class="p">Another potential route of dispersal into the U.S. could be into southern Florida either via Cuba or by airline and marine transportation channels that connect currently occupied vampire bat habitat with southern Florida. Vampire bats do not currently occur on Cuba, but our analysis (

It does not seem likely that vampire bats would travel the long distance over water between México’s Yucatan Peninsula and Cuba, and then to Florida, given the long distances between these land masses (ca. 175–200 km). However, it is possible that hurricanes and/or other human mediated events could result in a small number of colonizers becoming established on Cuba, which could serve as a stepping stone to Florida, or being directly transported to southern Florida. Current and future climate models suggest that vampire bats would likely find southern Florida to provide suitable habitat (Figs
