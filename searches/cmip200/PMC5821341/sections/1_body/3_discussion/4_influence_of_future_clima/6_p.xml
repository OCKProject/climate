<p class="p">Species of 
 <italic class="italic">Desmodus</italic> previously occupied portions of what is now the United States. The fossil record suggests that extinct and extant species of the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Desmodus</italic> occurred commonly in some areas of the U.S. as recently as 5,000–35,000 years before present. Fossil vampire bats are known from as far north as northern California (late Pleistocene; [

 <xref rid="pone.0192887.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]), from Cuba (&lt;10,000 years BP; [
 <xref rid="pone.0192887.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]), and from several sites in Florida, as well as from other sites in the U.S. [
 <xref rid="pone.0192887.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Thus, it would not be surprising if vampire bats again spread into the U.S. if future habitat and climate conditions became suitable to sustain viable populations.
