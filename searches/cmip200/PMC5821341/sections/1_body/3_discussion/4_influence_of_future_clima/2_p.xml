<p class="p">These results suggest two potential future routes of vampire bat dispersal into the U.S., one via southern Texas, and a second into southern Florida. Vampire bats are currently known to occur in two ecoregions of north-eastern México that extend into southern Texas: the Western Gulf Coastal Plains, and the Southern Texas Plains and Hills ([

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192887.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>). Both of these ecoregions offer relatively contiguous habitat between north-eastern México and southern Texas, consisting of similar geology and vegetation structure. Two of our future climate models (MARS and GLM) suggest that the coastal plains habitat in southern Texas may become suitable in the future, and the MARS model projects suitable coastal habitat to just south of Galveston, Texas by year 2070. Although vampire bats are not strong dispersers, homing experiments suggest that they may be familiar with large expanses of habitat around their seasonal roost sites. For example, they may travel up to 20 km away from their day roosts during nightly foraging bouts [
