<p class="p">A third route of potential dispersal into the U.S. over the long term—but not likely through year 2070—is from México via the Madrean Archipelago (also known as the Mandrean Sky Islands), which provides a connection between the Méxican states of Chihuahua and Sonora with Arizona and New Mexico [
 <xref rid="pone.0192887.ref066" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>]. Vampire bats are not known to occur in the Madrean Archipelago, but this ecoregion is adjacent to the hills and canyons of Sinaloa and Sonora, and could provide a corridor for dispersal into the U.S. if a changing climate resulted in the Mandrean Archipelago becoming suitable habitat for vampire bats at some point in the future. However, our analysis suggests that the Mandrean Archipelago is not likely to represent suitable habitat for vampire bats over the coming ~60 years.
