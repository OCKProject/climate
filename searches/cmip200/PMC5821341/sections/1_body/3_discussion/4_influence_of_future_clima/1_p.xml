<p class="p">Some of our SDM models support the hypothesis that suitable habitat for vampire bats may currently exist in parts of the México–U.S. borderlands, including extreme southern portions of Texas, as well as in southern Florida and Cuba (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192887.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>). However, our analysis suggests that extensive expansion into the south-eastern and south-western U.S. over the coming ~60 years is unlikely, even under worst-case climate change scenarios (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192887.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>). There was not a consensus among SDM approaches about whether suitable habitat for vampire bats will expand into the U.S. GLM and MARS indicate that there might be a slight expansion of suitable habitat into the U.S., especially into southern Texas; BRT, RF and Maxent suggest possible contraction of suitable habitat. Of the SDM approaches used, MARS suggested the largest expansion of habitat northward, while Maxent suggested the most contraction of suitable habitat. There is also substantial uncertainty regarding which global circulation model (GCM) to use for projecting into future climate scenarios, focusing especially on southern Texas, and it is still unclear which of the many GCMs might perform best in this region of the U.S. and the México-U.S. borderlands.
