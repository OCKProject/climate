<p class="p">In 1967, one hairy-legged vampire bat (
 <italic class="italic">Diphylla ecaudata</italic>) was documented in an abandoned tunnel near Comstock, Texas [
 <xref rid="pone.0192887.ref062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0192887.ref063" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>]. This record is approximately 700 km north of the next most northerly record of this species [
 <xref rid="pone.0192887.ref063" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>], and may represent an anomalous record a long distance from regularly occupied habitat [
 <xref rid="pone.0192887.ref064" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>] or may represent an as yet unidentified population in the México-Texas borderlands [
 <xref rid="pone.0192887.ref062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>]. Nevertheless, this record indicates that bats in the subfamily 
 <italic class="italic">Desmodontinae</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">Desmodus rotundus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Diphylla ecaudata</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Diaemus youngi</italic>; [
 <xref rid="pone.0192887.ref064" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0192887.ref065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>]) may occasionally be found and perhaps establish small and undetected populations north of their regularly occupied habitat. Given that recent population genetics data suggests that the vampire bat populations in north-eastern México are expanding spatially and demographically [
 <xref rid="pone.0192887.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>], that vampire bats have been recently documented within 50 km of the Texas border, and that there is a contiguous corridor of potentially-suitable habitat between north-eastern México and southern Texas [
 <xref rid="pone.0192887.ref047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>], it would not be unreasonable to hypothesize that the southern tip of Texas could become occupied by vampire bats in the future.
