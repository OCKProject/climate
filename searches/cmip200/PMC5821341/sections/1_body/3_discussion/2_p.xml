<p class="p">Vampire bats have been observed in diverse habitats throughout much of southern and central México, but do not tend to occur at the higher elevations of the Trans-Méxican Volcanic Belt (including near México City), the Sierra Madre Oriental, and the Sierra Madre Occidental [

 <xref rid="pone.0192887.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. However, given these results it appears possible that some vampire bats occur in the extreme southern portion of Texas and have not yet been detected, or that this species has not yet spread into potentially-suitable habitat, including areas with available prey resources. It is also possible that factors that we did not analyze are preventing the spread of vampire bats into this area. Our results also suggest that the southern half of the Florida Peninsula and parts of Cuba may currently represent suitable habitat for vampire bats (
