<p class="p">This was the first attempt to map potentially suitable habitats for common vampire bat in North America using multiple SDM approaches focusing explicitly on the MÃ©xico-U.S. borderlands. Our purpose was to use SDMs to evaluate the potential for vampire bats to expand northward into the southern United States. Our results demonstrate how combining species distribution models and ensemble mapping can be a useful tool for developing empirically-based and testable hypotheses of animal distributions and potential future distribution patterns, given the impacts of future climate conditions.</p>
