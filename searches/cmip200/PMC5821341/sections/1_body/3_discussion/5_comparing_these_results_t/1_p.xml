<p class="p">We restricted our analysis to distributional data on vampire bats from North America. Lee et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0192887.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>] used occurrence data from all available records of common vampire bats in North and South America. It is possible that the extent we used for our analyses (North America only) may explain some of the difference in our results. We considered highly plausible the McNab [

 <xref rid="pone.0192887.ref052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>] hypothesis that minimum annual temperature constrains the distribution of vampire bats, and thus we developed our final set of predictor variables beginning with the minimum temperature of the coldest month (WorldClim Bio 6) predictor. We then selected subsequent predictors that were both biologically plausible and not highly correlated. Mistry and Moreno-Valdez [
 <xref rid="pone.0192887.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>] used GCM data to evaluate how the 10°C January isotherm might change in and near the México–U.S. borderlands under future climate change scenarios. These researchers concluded that vampire bats “…probably will expand significantly along the east and west coasts of Mexico and into the southern tip and Gulf Coast of Texas, possibly including lower Louisiana” (pp. 10–11); they also concluded that some areas of Florida, Arizona, California, and the Baja Peninsula could become suitable habitat for vampire bats. We agree with Mistry and Moreno-Valdez that the Gulf coast of southern Texas is the area most likely to become suitable to vampire bats in future years. However, while we conclude that the southern tip of Texas and Florida may become suitable by year 2070, none of our models predicted that Louisiana could become suitable habitat by that time, or that contiguous areas would become suitable between the current northern limit of vampire bats and Arizona or California. Nevertheless, given that prey densities are relatively high in north-eastern México and in southern Texas [
 <xref rid="pone.0192887.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>], it would be reasonable to conclude that vampire bats could spread into extreme southern Texas under current and future climate conditions.
