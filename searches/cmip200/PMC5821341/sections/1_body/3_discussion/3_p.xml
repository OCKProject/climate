 <xref rid="pone.0192887.ref052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>] concluded that the distribution of vampire bats is correlated with, and possibly constrained by, the 10°C January average minimum isotherm. Our results support this conclusion that minimum annual temperatures constrain vampire bat distributions. The highest-ranked predictor variable in our analysis was minimum temperature of the coldest month (Bio 6, °C; 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0192887.t003" class="xref">Table 3</xref>), and this variable had substantially more support than any of the other predictor variables used. Additionally, all 5 SDM models predicted maximum habitat suitability between 15–20°C, but decreasing habitat suitability below 5–10°C (
