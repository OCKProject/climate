<p class="p">We analyzed the potential distribution of vampire bats in México and the southern U.S. using 5 SDM approaches: generalized linear models using logistic regression and maximum likelihood estimation (GLM), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), boosted regression trees (BRT), a random forest algorithm (RF), and maximum entropy (Maxent), using 10-fold cross-validation for each approach [

 <xref rid="pone.0192887.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. We used the Software for Assisted Habitat Modeling (SAHM) package for VisTrails software to fit species distribution models, perform model selection, and calculate performance metrics [
 <xref rid="pone.0192887.ref053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. For GLM, we used a bidirectional stepwise procedure using Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC), considering all interactions and squared terms. For MARS, we used Mars Degree (Friedman’s μ) = 1 and GVL penalty = 2.0. For BRT, we used alpha = 1, bag fraction = 0.5, and number of folds = 3, with other values at default values. For RF, we used the tuneRF function to minimize out of bag error. For Maxent, we allowed linear, quadratic, product, threshold, and hinge features, and used regularization values as linear/quadratic/product = 0.050 and hinge = 0.500.
