<p class="p">The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (referred to as AUC) is often used in the analysis of SDM results [

 <xref rid="pone.0192887.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Sensitivity (a model’s ability to predict true presences) and specificity (a model’s ability to predict background cells) are also commonly used SDM metrics for comparing model performance [
 <xref rid="pone.0192887.ref054" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]. We calculated AUC, sensitivity, and specificity to evaluate each SDM’s performance. For threshold-dependent metrics (sensitivity and specificity) we used the threshold that maximized the average of sensitivity and specificity [
 <xref rid="pone.0192887.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. We evaluated variable importance by SDM approach by using change in the AUC statistic with and without the variable, but with all other variables used; thus, we calculated increase in AUC (ΔAUC) when each predictor variable was permuted for each model approach, and then ranked predictor variables by mean ΔAUC.
