<p class="p">Each model produced an estimate of potential habitat suitability for each cell, expressed as continuous values between 0 and 1, given the data, model, and predictor variables used. Using the threshold described above for each SDM approach, we mapped potential habitat suitability for each SDM approach using binary maps. We then generated an ensemble map of potential vampire bat distribution by using the average of the binary estimates (0 or 1) of the 5 models for each cell on the template [
 <xref rid="pone.0192887.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. We used the SAHM [
 <xref rid="pone.0192887.ref053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>] output and R statistical software [
 <xref rid="pone.0192887.ref046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>] to create response curves for each of the 5 SDM approaches using the highest-scoring predictor variable.
