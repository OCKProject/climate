<p class="p">We used museum and other occurrence records of vampire bats collected in México available in the Global Biodiversity Information Facility dataset (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gbif.org" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.gbif.org</ext-link>) and by Méxican collaborators. We added to this data set over 600 records representing 77 vampire bat occurrence locations compiled by Piaggio et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0192887.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>], which were originally compiled for a study investigating vampire bat population genetics in the north-eastern portion of their range. The extent of the analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192887.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>) included North America from the southern México border with Guatemala to the latitude of the northern-most location of vampire bat fossils in the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Desmodus</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192887.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>; Potter Creek Cave, Shasta County, California, ~40° 47’ N; [
 <xref rid="pone.0192887.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0192887.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]). We used the fossil record for 
 <italic class="italic">Desmodus</italic> to define the northern limit of the template because we were interested in including areas that, although not recently inhabited by 
 <italic class="italic">Desmodus</italic>, have been inhabited by this genus since the late Pleistocene. The extent was expressed as a raster with cell resolution of 2.5 arc-minutes (~5 km x 5 km) in the North American Albers Equal Area Conic projection (NAD83 datum). We eliminated occurrence records that had information identifying locality to only Méxican states. Background samples were generated by selecting a random sample of 10,000 points from all available cells in the extent [
 <xref rid="pone.0192887.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. If a background sample coincided in the same cell with an occurrence record, the cell was classified as being occupied. These background points were compared to cells known to be occupied by vampire bats using each of 5 SDM algorithms (see below); thus, each algorithm was used as a binary classifier to predict whether a given cell on the template represented suitable habitat for vampire bats.
