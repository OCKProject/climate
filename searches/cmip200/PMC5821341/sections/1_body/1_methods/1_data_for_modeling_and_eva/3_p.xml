<p class="p">The predictor variables considered were selected based on their relevance as plausible predictors of vampire bat occurrence, but we restricted use of predictor variables to those that had a North American or global extent, an estimated resolution of 2.5 arc-minute (~5 km x 5 km), and which could be used in future climate scenarios. As potential predictor variables, we considered use of WorldClim climate data (°C, 1950–2000; [
 <xref rid="pone.0192887.ref047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]), USGS topographic data (elevation (m); [
 <xref rid="pone.0192887.ref048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]), MODIS Vegetation Continuous Field data [
 <xref rid="pone.0192887.ref049" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>], and MODIS Phenology data [
 <xref rid="pone.0192887.ref050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. We considered using current prey density as a predictor (e.g., cattle and feral pig densities) but did not have access to projections of how prey density might change under the climate change scenarios used in this analysis. We evaluated the correlation between each possible pair of predictor variables and eliminated one variable from each pair that was strongly correlated (Pearson or Spearman correlation, r &gt; 0.70; [
 <xref rid="pone.0192887.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]). During winter, vampire bats avoid areas with prolonged cold temperatures that would make normal activity excessively challenging, especially given that they are known to have difficulty defending body temperature at low ambient temperatures and do not hibernate [

 <xref rid="pone.0192887.ref052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>] used metabolic rates and field observations of behavior to propose that the distribution of the vampire bat was constrained by the 10°C January isotherm. Vampire bats also require daily access to blood meals [
 <xref rid="pone.0192887.ref052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]. Thus, we suspected that vampire bats seek areas with moderate winter temperatures that allowed for continued year-round activity and pursuit of prey resources. Thus, we included minimum temperature of the coldest month (WorldClim Bio6; °C) as a predictor. We also used Worldclim diurnal temperature range data (Bio2; °C) as a predictor, given that vampire bat activity is likely affected by daily temperature variation. Annual precipitation (Bio12; mm) and precipitation of the coldest quarter were also used as predictors, as we expected precipitation to influence the availability of vegetation that might influence prey availability and availability of roosting resources in trees. We considered using remote-sensed phenology and vegetation variables, such as percent tree cover (derived from MODIS Vegetation Continuous Field data; [
 <xref rid="pone.0192887.ref049" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]), and vegetation phenology data, such as length of growing season (MODIS Phenology data; [
 <xref rid="pone.0192887.ref050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]). However, we concluded that the addition of such data in future climate models might add additional uncertainly to the final model projections and maps. The final set of predictor variables used in this analysis are shown in
