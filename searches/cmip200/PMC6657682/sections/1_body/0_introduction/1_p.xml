<p class="p">In a world where environmental changes occur faster than ever due to the expansion of human activities across all the continents (
 <xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ellis et al., 2010</xref>), the extinction of thousands of species is projected (
 <xref rid="ref-32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lovejoy, 2017</xref>). Despite the unfavorable prospect, extinctions can still be avoided (
 <xref rid="ref-40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Pimm et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, studies that identify extinction risks for diverse groups of organisms are relevant and raise public awareness about the importance of conserving species and their habitats as well as trigger policies and public investment required to tackle the problem (
