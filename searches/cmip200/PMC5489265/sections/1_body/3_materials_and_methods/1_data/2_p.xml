<p class="p">All our analyses are based on seasonal averages over the warm season (that is, one value per year). We defined the warm season as the hottest 3 months of the climatology of 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>. For the CMIP5 models, the warm season was defined based on 1870â€“1969. A change in time periods has little impact on the definition of warmest season or the interannual correlation between 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> (see below).
