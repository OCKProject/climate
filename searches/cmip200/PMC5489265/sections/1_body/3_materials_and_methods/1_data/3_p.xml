<p class="p">For CMIP5 data, before all calculations, all data were bilinearly interpolated to an equal 2.5° spatial grid. To compute changes in bivariate 100-year return periods of extremely hot and dry warm seasons, we chose the two time periods 1870–1969 and 2001–2100. These time periods were chosen as a trade-off between maximizing the climate change signal and, at the same time, maximizing the number of samples for computing bivariate extremes. Choosing 3 months as the length of an event is a compromise between potentially longer-lasting droughts and heat waves, which occur on shorter time scales. The combination of summer means in temperature and precipitation is a good indicator for the extremeness of the summer and its impacts (
