<p class="p">We used two different approaches to investigate compound extremes of extremely hot and dry warm seasons: (i) We counted concurrent exceedances of 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic> over the 90th percentile (“hot”) and 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> below the 10th percentile (“dry”), and (ii) we modeled the dependence of 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic> and −
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> with copulas and computed the bivariate return period from the fitted copula. Modeling dependence with a copula allowed us to investigate the effect of the dependence of 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> on bivariate return periods (see below).
