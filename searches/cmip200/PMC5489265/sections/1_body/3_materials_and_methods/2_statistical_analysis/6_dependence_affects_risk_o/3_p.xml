<p class="p">For modeled and observation-based 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> averaged over the warm season, we computed the likelihood multiplication factor starting with 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> = 0.01, corresponding to a 100-year return period for independent variables (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>). Figure S2 shows the effective return period if the thresholds to compute return periods had been defined under the assumption that 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> were independent (that is, showing RP
 <sub class="sub">1</sub>).
