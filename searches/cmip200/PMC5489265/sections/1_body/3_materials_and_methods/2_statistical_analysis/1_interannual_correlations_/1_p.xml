<p class="p">We computed interannual correlations between 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> averaged over the warm season at each location and model/data set. We investigated correlations in CMIP5 for the whole globe (land and ocean), but we used only land data for observation-based data sets. To eliminate the climate change signal on long-term trends, we linearly detrended both variables before computing correlations. Detrending has little impact on the correlation for the period 1870â€“1969 (fig. S6A) but strongly affects the correlation during the 21st century (fig. S6B). This is because the strong warming trend in 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic> in the 21st century overrides correlations at the interannual scale.
