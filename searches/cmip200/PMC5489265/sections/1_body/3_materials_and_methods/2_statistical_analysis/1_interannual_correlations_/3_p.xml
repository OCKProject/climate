<p class="p">To incorporate potential impacts of serial correlation, we tested whether seasonally averaged 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> are significantly serially correlated in time. Figure S7 shows that for most regions on land and most models, 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> are not significantly correlated at lag 1 (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05). For some tropical areas, including the Amazon, Congo, and Indonesia, most models show significant serial correlation at lag 1 for 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>. However, this is not the case for 
 <italic class="italic">P.</italic> Hence, we concluded that serial correlation should not have a significant impact on the assessment of bivariate extremes. All the remaining analyses were based on land data only.
