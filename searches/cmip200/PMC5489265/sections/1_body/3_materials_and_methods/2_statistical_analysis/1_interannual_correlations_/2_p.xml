<p class="p">In comparison to observation-based data sets, CMIP5 models capture the negative correlation between 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> quite well (fig. S5). Observation-based data sets lie within the 10th-to-90th percentile range of CMIP5 models in 75% of the land area. In the remaining areas, the negative correlations between 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> were generally much stronger in CMIP5, for instance, in the Amazon, Mexico, large parts of Africa and western Australia, and northern Canada and Greenland. Although this might suggest that CMIP5 models generally overestimate the strength of correlation between 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> during the warm season in these areas, this may partly also be related to noise in the observation-based data sets and the spatial coverage of actual climate stations (
 <xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">46</italic>
 </xref>). Correlations in CMIP5 were stronger especially in the tropics and subtropics, where the station cover for deriving observation-based gridded climate data is sparse (
 <xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">42</italic>
 </xref>), thus leaving the covariation between 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> less well constrained.
