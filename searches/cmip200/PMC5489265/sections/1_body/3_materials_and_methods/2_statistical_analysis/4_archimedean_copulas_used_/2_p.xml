<p class="p">To illustrate how these four copulas look like, we plotted 1000 random samples from the Frank, Clayton, Gumbel, and Joe copulas in fig. S8. Some of these copulas are able to model tail dependence, that is, the property that extremes are correlated. As illustrated in fig. S8, the Frank copula has no tail dependence, the Clayton copula has lower tail dependence, and the Gumbel and Joe copulas have upper tail dependence.</p>
