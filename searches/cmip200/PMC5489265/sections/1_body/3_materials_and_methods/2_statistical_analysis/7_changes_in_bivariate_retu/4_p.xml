<p class="p">We tested whether the ensemble median of the models shows an increase in likelihood with the one-sided sign test (
 <xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">58</italic>
 </xref>). We corrected for multiple testing by controlling the false discovery rate, as suggested by Wilks (
 <xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">59</italic>
 </xref>), and highlighted regions for which the model ensemble median of the likelihood multiplication factor is significantly larger than 1 with stippling (adjusted 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.1).
