<p class="p">The likelihood of a bivariate extreme may change if the dependence structure of the two underlying variables changes. A simple approach of assessing changes in bivariate extremes is to count concurrent exceedances of 90th percentiles in detrended 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic> and −
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> in 1870–1969 and 2001–2100. Figure S3 shows the differences in these counts. However, in this approach, the historical exceedance probabilities vary according to their dependence, and we cannot assess changes in, for example, 100-year events.
