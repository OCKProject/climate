<p class="p">To obtain uniform distributions in the marginals, we transformed marginal distributions into normalized ranks, which is a common procedure when working with copulas (

  <italic class="italic">52</italic>
 </xref>, 
 <xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">53</italic>
 </xref>) and is the only reasonable choice if goodness of fit is to be tested appropriately (
 <xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">54</italic>
 </xref>). We fit four different Archimedean copulas (Clayton, Frank, Gumbel, and Joe; see above and fig. S8) and selected the one with the best fit relying on the Bayesian Information Criterion implemented in the R package VineCopula (

  <italic class="italic">55</italic>
 </xref>). Goodness of fit was tested based on the Cramér–von Mises statistic (
 <xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">54</italic>
 </xref>) implemented in the R package copula (
 <xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">56</italic>
 </xref>). 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> values below 0.05 (rejecting the hypothesis that the copula is a good fit) were obtained for about 3% of the fits, which is an acceptable rate.
