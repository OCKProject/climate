<p class="p">Although our analysis focused on bivariate extremes, because we used a copula-based approach, goodness of fit was tested on the whole distribution. Hence, goodness-of-fit statistics may be largely driven by the less extreme values. However, using copulas allowed us to switch between different return periods without the need to fit a new model for each of the different return periods (for example, see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Figs. 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">4C</xref> and fig. S4). In addition, all results were averaged across &gt;80 model runs (table S1), which reduced some of the uncertainty related to the fitting procedure (
 <xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">57</italic>
 </xref>). 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Figure 2C</xref> provides some confidence that our approach based on copulas captures the desired change in likelihood due to a change in dependence well.
