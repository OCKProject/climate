<p class="p">Using copulas to model the dependence of temperature and precipitation allows an assessment of the change in likelihood of a 100-year event between the historical time period and the 21st century, ignoring the climate change signal on the trend. This likelihood is increased by a factor of up to 2 in the model average in some regions (spatial mean, 1.32), leading to a doubling in occurrence rate (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Fig. 4B</xref>), the increase in likelihood of extremely hot and dry warm seasons is largest in the northern extratropics, eastern Asia, and some parts of western South America. Despite large model uncertainties, in about 19% of the land area, this increase in likelihood is significant (
