<p class="p">The return period of an extremely hot and dry warm season that has a 100-year return period if temperature and precipitation were not correlated is reduced to merely 16 years in some regions due to the negative correlation between temperature and precipitation (fig. S2). This corresponds to a sixfold increase in likelihood (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>, A and B). The spatial distribution of this change in likelihood of extremely hot and dry warm seasons explains why some regions experience these compound events more often than others do. For example, averaged over central North America, the likelihood of a 100-year summer based on independent temperature and precipitation is increased by a factor 4.0 ± 0.9 because of their correlation. The likelihood of a 100-year event is increased by a factor of 3.6 ± 0.6 and 3.4 ± 0.5 in the Amazon and South Africa, respectively; by a factor of 3.2 ± 1.0 and 3.2 ± 0.5 in central Europe and South Asia, respectively; and by a factor of 3.0 ± 0.7 in East Asia (
