<p class="p">A simple approach to investigate the occurrence rate of extremely hot and dry warm seasons consists of counting the number of years in which both variables exceed a quantile-based threshold (
 <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">30</italic>
 </xref>). As an example, we pick a grid point in western Russia where precipitation and temperature are strongly negatively correlated in summer (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = −0.63; 1901–2013). We now count the number of summers in which temperature exceeds the 90th percentile and in which precipitation is at the same time below the 10th percentile (that is, negative precipitation exceeds the 90th percentile). Five summers fulfill this criterion (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Fig. 2A</xref>). If precipitation and temperature were uncorrelated, this number would lie between 1 and 2 [the expected number is (1 − 0.9)*(1 − 0.9)*113 = 1.13]. Although this is a straightforward approach to investigate compound extremes, it has the disadvantage that, for very extreme events, these exceedances contain only very few samples, thus requiring very long time series. For instance, if temperature and precipitation are uncorrelated and we count occurrences for which both variables exceed their 90th percentile, this results in only one event, on average, in the case of a 100-year time series, rendering an investigation of changes in occurrence rates unfeasible. To overcome the shortcomings of counting exceedances, we model here the dependence structure of temperature and precipitation with copulas (
 <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">32</italic>
 </xref>) and subsequently derive exceedance probabilities and return periods (Materials and Methods). Analogous to the simple approach introduced above, we define bivariate extremes as the concurrent exceedance of some predefined quantile. For two random variables 
 <italic class="italic">X</italic> (for example, temperature) and 
 <italic class="italic">Y</italic> (for example, negative precipitation), we compute

 <italic class="italic">x</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">y</italic> representing the same quantile of 
 <italic class="italic">X</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Y</italic>, respectively. We model 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="E1" class="xref">Eq. 1</xref> with the help of copulas, which model the dependence between 
 <italic class="italic">X</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Y</italic> (see Materials and Methods). This dependence thus affects the probability 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> of a bivariate extreme. The return period RP in years of this bivariate extreme is then given as RP = 1/
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> (note that we have one value per year). We quantify the impact of the correlation between temperature and precipitation on the likelihood of extremely hot and dry warm seasons (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref> and Materials and Methods). For instance, for the grid point in western Russia, a 20-year event (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.05) based on independent (permuted) temperature and precipitation becomes an 8-year event (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> ≈ 0.13) if the correlation between temperature and precipitation is taken into account (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Fig. 2B</xref>). Similarly, a 50-year event (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.02) becomes a 1-year event (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> ≈ 0.08). Dependence (measured here as correlation) between climate variables thus directly influences the likelihood of compound extremes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Fig. 2C</xref>). Both approaches, the counting approach and the approach based on copulas, lead to similar results on artificial data (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Fig. 2C</xref>), although with higher uncertainty associated with the counting approach. The comparison is shown for bivariate extremes based on 90th percentiles (corresponding to a 100-year event for independent data, that is, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.01). In principle, it is also possible that variables are strongly correlated, but their extremes do not co-occur [so-called tail independence (
 <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">32</italic>
 </xref>); see Materials and Methods]. However, below, we show that the correlation between temperature and precipitation is a good indicator for the likelihood of an extremely hot and dry warm season. This may be related to the fact that the analyzed events are not extreme enough to see the effect of tail (in)dependence.
