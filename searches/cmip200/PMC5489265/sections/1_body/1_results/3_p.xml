<p class="p">Greenhouse gas–induced climate change is projected to lead to a strong increase in temperature in many regions of the world, accompanied by differing trends in precipitation (

 </xref>). Under the business-as-usual climate change scenario, the state-of-the-art climate models collected in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) project very large increases in the concurrent exceedance of the historical 90th percentiles of temperature and dryness during the warm season (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Fig. 4A</xref>). In many regions, the occurrence rate of extremely hot and dry warm seasons increases by a factor of 10 between the historical time periods (1870–1969) and the 21st century. These exceptional changes are largely driven by strong long-term trends in temperature and precipitation. If we subtract these trends (see Materials and Methods), the CMIP5 models project and intensification of the predominant negative interannual correlation between temperature and precipitation in many regions of the world (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>) intensifies under future climate change, in addition to the change in mean climate. Particularly in the northern extratropics, but also in the Amazon region and in Indonesia, the change in negative correlation can be up to −0.2 in the model mean. Little change or a slight increase in correlation (that is, decrease in negative correlation) is projected in the Mediterranean, Central America, the Sahel, and northern and eastern Australia. As demonstrated below, an increase in negative correlation translates into an increase of the occurrence rate of extremely dry and hot warm seasons (see also
