<p class="p">Although important for assessments of future risks associated with climate extremes, the investigation of changes in the occurrence of compound events has received only limited attention so far (

 </xref>). Here, we translate the detected changes in correlation between detrended temperature and precipitation into changes in likelihood of experiencing concurrent extremes. Counting the occurrence of events lying above the 90th percentile for temperature and below the 10th percentile of precipitation slightly increases between the two periods 1871–1969 and 2001–2100 (fig. S3), with spatial patterns approximately resembling the change in correlation (
