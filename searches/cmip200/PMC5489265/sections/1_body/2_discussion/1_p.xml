 </xref>). Our results demonstrate that, in addition to the trend induced by warming, the strengthening of the dependence between temperature and precipitation further exacerbates the increase in co-occurrence of very hot and dry warm seasons in many regions. This increase can approach a doubling of probability in the 21st century for 100-year events of the historical time period. These results suggest that even if systems adapt to mean climate change, they will be hit by extremely hot and dry warm seasons more frequently. Quantifying this effect is highly relevant for future projections of impact assessments because the co-occurrence of extremely hot and dry conditions causes disproportionate impacts. Statistical projections of future impacts for which temperature and precipitation are relevant may thus not be very reliable. For making reliable projections, Earth system models need to be validated to represent the correct covariability between climatic variables. For many regions, this is a challenge because observational data sets are not well constrained (see fig. S5 and Materials and Methods).
