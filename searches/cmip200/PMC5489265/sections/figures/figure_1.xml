  <title class="title">Correlation between temperature and precipitation during the warm season.</title>
  <p class="p">The warm season is determined as the hottest 3-month period in the temperature climatology. The correlation is computed as the interannual correlation of the yearly averaged values of temperature and precipitation over the considered 3-month period. (
   <bold class="bold">A</bold>) Model mean of correlations of all CMIP5 models (1870–1969). Stippling is shaded according to the fraction of models that show significant correlations at the 0.05 level if this fraction is larger than 0.5. (
   <bold class="bold">B</bold>) Mean of the correlations of the observation-based data sets CRU (1901–2013), Princeton (1901–2012), and Delaware (1901–2012). Oceans and areas, where less than two of the three data sets show significant correlations at the 0.05 level, are colored in gray.
