  <title class="title">Increase in likelihood of extremely hot and dry warm seasons due to dependence.</title>
  <p class="p">Starting from a 100-year event with independent temperature and negative precipitation (that is, both exceed their 90th percentile), the increase in likelihood of these events due to the dependence between temperature and correlation is shown. (
   <bold class="bold">A</bold>) Average of the increases in likelihood across all CMIP5 models. (
   <bold class="bold">B</bold>) Average of the increases in likelihood in the data sets CRU, Princeton, and Delaware. (
   <bold class="bold">C</bold>) Increases in likelihood were averaged over CMIP5 models across the regions central North America (CNA), Amazon (AMZ), central Europe (CEU), South Africa (SAF), East Asia (EAS), and South Asia (SAS). Whiskers represent 1 SD over all models. (
   <bold class="bold">D</bold>) As in (C) but averaged over observation-based data sets CRU, Princeton, and Delaware. Whiskers represent 1 SD over all three data sets.
