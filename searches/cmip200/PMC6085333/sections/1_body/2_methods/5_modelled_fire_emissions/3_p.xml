<p id="Par46" class="p">Different representations of anthropogenic land cover and land use change over the industrial period in each fire dataset contribute significantly to the difference in PI emissions at northern mid-latitudes (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). The AeroCom and CMIP6 datasets assume that anthropogenic land cover does not change much over time, which is unrealistic

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">39</xref>,

 </sup>. As LMfire incorporates a dedicated modelling scheme for simulating post-harvest agricultural fires, the extra impact of agricultural fires on emissions from cropland areas are contributing to the larger emissions in these regions compared to SIMFIRE-BLAZE. In these simulations 10% of the annual agricultural biomass is assumed to be left on the field post-harvest and subsequently burned each year.
