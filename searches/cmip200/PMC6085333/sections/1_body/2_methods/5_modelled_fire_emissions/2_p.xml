<p id="Par45" class="p">Total biomass available as fuel (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref>) is calculated for SIMFIRE-BLAZE as the sum of carbon in living vegetation and the carbon in litter, and for LMfire as the sum of living vegetation in herbaceous vegetation and the carbon in litter. The spatial distribution of PI biomass is largely similar to the PD

 </sup> with peak biomass amounts simulated in SH tropical and NH boreal regions and appreciable biomass amounts in NH mid-latitudes (particularly around the Mediterranean and Eastern USA and China regions). Burned area (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref>) is defined as the annual mean fraction of the grid cell which burns over the studied simulation time frame. Burned area in LMfire is calculated based on the well-established Rothermel equations of rate of fire spread, so fires spread only when fuel is available. Globally, modelled maxima in burned area for both LMfire and SIMFIRE-BLAZE do not exceed PD maxima observed burned areas within African Savannah regions
