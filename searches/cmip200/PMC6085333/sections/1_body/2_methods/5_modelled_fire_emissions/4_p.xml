 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> from biomass burning can be resolved by scaling fire emissions by a factor of 1.5–3.4, depending on dataset. They also note that other models require a scaling as high as a factor of 6, although 2–3 is more common. We therefore suggest that our uncertainty (factor of 2) in PI emissions reflects this current PD uncertainty—but is not higher and hence not unrealistic.
