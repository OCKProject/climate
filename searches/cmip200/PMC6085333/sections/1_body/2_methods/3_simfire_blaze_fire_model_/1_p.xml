<p id="Par34" class="p">The principle fire modelling dataset is a transient simulation using the LPJ-GUESS-SIMFIRE-BLAZE model, where PI is defined as the mean of 1750-to-1770 and PD is defined as the mean of 2003-to-2012. The BLAZE (L.P.N. et al., manuscriptÂ in preparation) combustion model simulates fire driven fluxes within the biosphere and from biosphere to atmosphere. It computes survival-probabilities for stands of trees based on the vegetation properties and potential fire-line intensity (FLI)

 </sup> using an algorithm fitted to values of average annual maximum fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR), the maximum annual Nesterov-index, the biome-type, and human population density. The reciprocal of the monthly fractional area of grassland burned is used as a stochastic proxy for the occurrence of fire affecting forested regions in each grid cell. Fluxes between live and litter pools as well as the atmosphere are then computed depending on FLI. SIMFIRE-BLAZE is incorporated within the LPJ-GUESS dynamic vegetation model
