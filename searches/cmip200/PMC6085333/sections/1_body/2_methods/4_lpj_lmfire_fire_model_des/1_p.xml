 </sup> includes processes to simulate natural wildfires from lightning ignition and a unique representation of fire generated by both agricultural and pastoral societies. To run LMfire we combined climatological mean climate fields that provide a high-spatial-resolution baseline, with detrended, interpolated climate anomalies from reanalysis simulations that provide interannual variability. The original datasets used to drive the model are described in TableÂ 3 of Pfeiffer et al.
