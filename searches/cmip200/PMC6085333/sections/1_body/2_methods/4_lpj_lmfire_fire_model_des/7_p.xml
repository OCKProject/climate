<p id="Par41" class="p">In all three GFED regions (encompassing the USA and Mediterranean) where PD LMfire emissions were scaled, the scaling reflects a modern-day fire suppression practice driven largely by technologies and ideologies that were not present in 1750. For example, in the PD US &gt; 99.5% fires are actively suppressed
