<p id="Par39" class="p">Modern agricultural practices and legislation to protect air quality mean that in some parts of the world intentional burning of used land is currently rare. To account for this in the PD simulation, we set the burning-on-used-land factor described above to not exceed the observed burned area fraction in the JR12 burned area dataset

 </sup>, which leads to burning on used land at PD to be effectively zero in large parts of North America and Europe.
