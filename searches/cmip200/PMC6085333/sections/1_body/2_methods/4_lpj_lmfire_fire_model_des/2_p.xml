 </sup> is used to impose interannual variability in our simulations in several steps. First, we prepared monthly anomalies relative to the period 1961–1990 for: mean temperature, diurnal temperature range, total precipitation, number of days with precipitation, cloud cover, wind speed, and convective-available potential energy (CAPE). These monthly anomalies are then detrended using a robust loess regression filter

 </sup> with a bandwidth of 30 years. Next, we interpolated the detrended anomalies for each meteorological variable to 0.5° spatial resolution. Next, a climate driver dataset was generated from a 1080-year climate dataset by dividing the 140-year detrended climate anomalies into twelve 30-year blocks at 10-year intervals. Anomalies were then sampled using a pseudo-random scheme where once a block was chosen it was not selected again until all of the other remaining blocks have been selected. In order to generate a 1080-year timeseries 36 blocks were selected, i.e., each block was used three times but appeared in a different order each time. Finally, each anomaly timeseries was added to its complementary baseline climatological mean climate field, and used the resulting 1080-year (12960-month) climate data input file to run LMfire. For the PI simulation in LMfire, we used only the last 150 years of this model run, i.e., years 931–1080, as this is the period where all of the model pools are considered to be in equilibrium, although we acknowledge that the actual state of the terrestrial biosphere in the late preindustrial Holocene may have been far from equilibrium in many regions
