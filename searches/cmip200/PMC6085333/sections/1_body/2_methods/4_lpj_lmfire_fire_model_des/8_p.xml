<p id="Par42" class="p">Differences in fire emissions within boreal regions between LMfire and GFED4s are in part due to the longer simulation time within LMfire (150 years) compared to satellite measurements, resulting in fires being simulated in the model that are not represented in the satellite record used to construct the GFED4s emission dataset. In particular, the wide range of fire regimes within the Arctic tundra leads to fire return periods of between decades to millennia

Other differences include assumptions about fuel load, combustion completeness, emission factors, permafrost, PD fire suppression and increased post-harvest agricultural burning in the PI that is not present in the PD due to land use change practices. Within semi-arid regions LMfire predicts a shorter fire return interval
