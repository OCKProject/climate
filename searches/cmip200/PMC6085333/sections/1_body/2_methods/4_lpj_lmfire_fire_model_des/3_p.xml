 </sup> defines that 50% of the litter on 20% of the used land (cropland and pasture) is burned annually. As the seasonality of burning on used land is not well known at global scale, fire emissions are partitioned evenly across all snow-free days of the year with mean temperature above 0 °C. In reality, most biomass burning on used land probably occurred during certain periods of the year, e.g., after harvest, but it is currently beyond the capability of any global land use scenario to prescribe these periods.
