<p id="Par43" class="p">To test the sensitivity of PI fire emission estimates to natural climate variability the 150-year emission dataset of LMfire was partitioned into 15 decadal mean fire climatologies, each representing a plausible PI fire landscape. As tropical and extra-tropical fires belong to distinct regimes with different characteristics, four different scenarios (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>) based on the maximum and minimum emissions from each were selected. These four scenarios were then used to generate the uncertainty range in estimates of LMfire emissions in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> and the range in radiative forcing calculations in Supplementary Table
