 </sup> provides monthly fire emissions from 1750 to 2015 anchored to GFED4s PD (1997â€“2015) emissions. Estimates of historical fire emissions are derived by merging the satellite record with fire proxy records (fire tracers contained within snow and ice and the charcoal record) in regions with suitable proxy coverage (North America and Europe), and by using the mean of six fire models in regions of limited proxy record coverage. Within the tropical rainforest regions of Equatorial Asia (including Indonesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia) and South America fire emissions are held constant back in time from 1960 and 1970, respectively. Agricultural fires are also kept relatively constant over time. Here we use the mean of emissions from 1750 to 1770 to represent the PI and the mean of emissions from 2006 to 2015 to represent the PD. The CMIP6 PI dataset is presented here as a lower bound to, and likely underestimates, the magnitude of PI fire emissions because the fire models used to construct the main part of the inventory are unable to reproduce the observed 24% decrease in global burned area over the last 18 years due to human impact
