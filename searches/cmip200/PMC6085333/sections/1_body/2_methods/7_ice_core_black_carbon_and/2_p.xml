 </sup>, and by using a single year’s meteorology we do not capture possible changes to modelled deposition process (e.g., precipitation rates) at the ice core location. Another issue is relating the modelled regional aerosol emissions and processes to the point measurements of a single ice core, which can also capture emissions from varying sources. To account for uncertainties in the PI period caused by natural variability in fire activity and atmospheric circulation, the Greenland and Wyoming ice core BC concentrations in the PI were calculated as a 20-year mean (D4: 1788–1807, NEEM: 1740–1759, Wyoming: 1747–1766). In the PD Greenland ice core BC concentrations are also heavily influenced by industrial emissions that have been decreasing in strength over the past decades. We therefore calculate Greenland ice core means over a shorter 5-year period (D4: 1998–2002, NEEM: 1994–1998), and the Wyoming ice core over a 10 year period (1970–1979). The PD/PI ratio range was calculated using the standard error of the mean. The mean PD/PI BC, ratio for 5, 10 and 20-year averages in both time periods, and the standard errors, are shown in Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>. Mean PI BC concentrations from the Wyoming ice core are highly sensitive to the chosen PI start year; altering from 1747 (first year in the record) to 1750 (first year in the fire emission datasets) would increase mean PI BC concentrations by 23%, further reducing the measurement-based PD/PI BC ratio. For model M and observation O the symmetric bias factor was calculated as: For M &gt; O: (M/O)−1; For O &gt; M: –(O/M) + 1. Uncertainty in the CMIP6 industrial BC emission inventory used to calculate the decrease in BC emissions from anthropogenic activity in the region of the WY (factor of 1.6) and CG (factor of 2) glacier ice cores could be up to a factor of two
