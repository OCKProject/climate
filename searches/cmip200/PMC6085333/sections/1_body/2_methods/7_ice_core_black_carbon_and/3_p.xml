<p id="Par51" class="p">Specific fire emission tracers are also recorded within the Greenland ice cores: yearly measurements of Vanillic acid (VA) at D4 and sub-decadal (~2 measurements decade
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) Levoglucosan (LG) measurements at NEEM. The mean PD/PI VA and LG ratio for 5, 10 and 20-year averages in both time periods, and the standard errors, are shown in Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>. The sub-decadal NEEM data has a large fire year within the 20-year mean (155 ng/g LG compared to a mean of 44 ng/g LG without that year) and therefore the PD/PI ratio is shown both with and without this year included. Measurements of LG and VA show that PD fire emissions deposited to Greenland have decreased since the PI, further supporting the fire model emission data (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>).
