  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">44</xref>
 </sup> at 45.6° N, 7.5° E and 4450 m above sea level. Each site has BC measurements for different historical periods: D4 1788 to 2002; NEEM 78 to 1998; CG has a single year PI measurement at 1750 and an average PD measurement between 1950 and 1980. The CG site is located within a heterogeneous alpine environment and BC concentrations in both time periods are calculated as the average concentrations from the model level matching the ice core site over six grid cells: the grid cell containing the CG site plus the grid cells directly to the east, west, south, southeast and southwest, those adjacent to the north were not included as it is assumed the Alps would provide a barrier to continental air flow. As the Greenland sites are within a more homogenous Arctic environment BC concentrations in both time periods are calculated at the ground level within the closest four grid cell containing the site.
