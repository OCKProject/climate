The GCD contains 736 charcoal records (NH: 436, SH: 300). Following Marlon et al.

 </sup> charcoal accumulation records in the GCD are transformed in a 3 step process prior to examination to allow comparison of records that are based on a wide range of sampling techniques. Step 1: minimax transformation to rescale values. Step 2: Box-Cox transformation to homogenise the variance within individual time series. Step 3: rescaling values to Z-scores. A LOcally WEighted regression Scatter plot Smoother (LOWESS) smoothing of the data was employed with a 10-year window half-width (i.e., a 20 year smoothing). Bootstrap analysis (1000 samples by site) gives a 97.5% confidence interval. The main difference in the charcoal analysis presented here compared to those in previous studies

 </sup> is that the charcoal influx anomaly base period for all panels is 1750–2015 CE. This time period is omitted from the base period in other charcoal reconstructions so as to avoid the impacts of anthropogenic activity on the results, which is what we wish to capture in this study.
