<p id="Par48" class="p">The GLObal Model of Aerosol Processes (GLOMAP) was used to calculate monthly mean aerosol mass and number concentrations in seven lognormal modes (one soluble nucleation mode, plus one insoluble and one soluble for each of the Aitken, accumulation and coarse modes)

The horizontal grid resolution is 2.8° × 2.8° with 31 vertical levels between the surface and 10 hPa. Modelled aerosol transport in both time periods is prescribed by 3D gridded wind speed, temperature and humidity fields for year 2008 from the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), which are interpolated every 6 h. Cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) number concentrations are calculated at 0.2% supersaturation following Petters and Kreidenweis

 <italic class="italic">κ</italic>) values of 0.61 for sulphate, 1.28 for sea salt, 0.1 for organic carbon and 0.0 for black carbon (BC). Aged soluble aerosols in GLOMAP are internally mixed and contain the species: sulphate, sea salt, organic carbon, BC and dust. We report CCN concentrations at the 915 hPa model level (~850 m a.s.l.), approximately corresponding to cloud base for low-level warm stratiform clouds. GLOMAP-mode has previously been used to model aerosol number concentrations in various studies involving biomass burning aerosols
