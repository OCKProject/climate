 </sup>. AeroCom PI fire emissions are calculated by scaling back present day (year 2000) fire emissions from the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED2)
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" class="xref">60</xref>
 </sup> database according to the change in human population density between the PI and PD. Deforestation fires are scaled solely by population density data while fire emissions from all other land surface types are scaled to 60% of their PD value, assuming 40% would burn naturally. Exceptions for high latitude boreal regions were made to account for changes in fire suppression and are assumed to be double PD levels.
