<p id="Par6" class="p">Here we use two fire models driven by distinct philosophies of the relationship between humans and fire to simulate a range of PI fire emissions which are consistent with current knowledge of how humans influence global fire occurrence, as well as representing the uncertainty in anthropogenic land cover and land use change from the PI to the PD (see Methods). Emissions in the two fire models are much greater than in the AeroCom and CMIP6 PI datasets and are more in line with the trends predicted from paleofire proxy records. When used in a global aerosol model, the fire models result in a substantial reduction in the magnitude of anthropogenic aerosol forcing over the Industrial Era compared to the CMIP6 fire emission scenario; which has not been accounted for in climate models.</p>
