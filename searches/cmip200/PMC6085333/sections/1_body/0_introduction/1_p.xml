  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>
 </sup>. Analyses of ice core records, charcoal measured in lake and marine sediments, and tree-rings suggest that fire activity varied considerably over the last 500 years, but that generally fire occurrence increased to a peak around 1850 CE before declining to PD levels
