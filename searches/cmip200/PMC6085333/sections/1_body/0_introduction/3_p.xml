<p id="Par5" class="p">A large number of global fire models exist, of which six contributed to the creation of historical fire emissions in the CMIP6 dataset
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>
 </sup>. However, most fire models still assume an overall positive relationship between human population and fire
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>
 </sup> so they do not capture the observed human-driven decline in burned area, and hence fire emissions, over the last decades
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">20</xref>
 </sup>. Therefore, CMIP6 probably underestimates PI fire emissions.
