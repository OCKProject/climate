 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">20</xref>
 </sup>. For example, observationally based estimates of burned area over the last few decades suggest a global decline of 1–2% per year

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">20</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>

 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">23</xref>

 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">24</xref>
 </sup> suggest an overall global decline of 25–30% in burned area since the PI. This decline in fire is a result of human activity: e.g., passive fire suppression from landscape fragmentation limits the spread of fires
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">25</xref>

 </sup>. Therefore, advances in global fire modelling
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>
 </sup> suggest a significantly different pattern of fire occurrence under PI conditions (modelled PI burned area estimates: Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref>), with consequently higher aerosol emissions than previously estimated.
