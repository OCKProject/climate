The CMIP6 dataset for both the PI and PD combines information from satellite measurements, fire emission proxy records and six fire models from the Fire Model Intercomparison Project (FireMIP; see Methods). To assess how the CMIP6 fire dataset and our new fire models compare to earlier understanding of PI fire emissions we also compare to the Dentener et al.

We also calculate the effect on the aerosol radiative forcing between the PI and PD assuming a common observation-based fire emission dataset for the PD, which is also used in CMIP6 (see Methods).
