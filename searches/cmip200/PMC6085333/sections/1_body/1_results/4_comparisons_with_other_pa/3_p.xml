<p id="Par21" class="p">Greenland ice core measurements of unique chemical tracers of fires are also consistent with a decrease in fire emissions since the PI (see Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref> and Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>). We note that CO measurements in Antarctic ice cores

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">7</xref>
