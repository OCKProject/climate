<p id="Par22" class="p">Overall, the CMIP6 fire emission inventory does not capture the trends in these proxies, which are more closely in agreement with the overall trends in fire occurrence calculated from fire modelling, which specifically incorporates information on the non-linear relationship between fire occurrence and human population density. In terms of fire model performance, neither model outperforms the other in all regions and each has its own strengths (see Methods). Based on currently available measurements and the limited comparison with ice core records, we suggest that LMfire represents what is likely to be an upper limit to the plausible range of PI fire emissions in many regions, particularly in the extra-tropics.</p>
