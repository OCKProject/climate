 </sup> recently reported a 28% decline in global burned area from the PI (1850–1870) to PD (2005–2010). Applying this change to PD estimates of burned area from GFED4s (~475 Mha)

 </sup> and FINN (~725 Mha)

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">46</xref>
 </sup> results in an estimated PI range in burned area from 679 to 1040 Mha (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref>). Emissions from SIMFIRE-BLAZE in the PI are based on a burned area of 641 Mha, while emissions from LMfire are based on a burned area of 1180 Mha (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref>). This would suggest that burned area in SIMFIRE-BLAZE is below the lower end of the range in PI burned area and LMfire is above the upper end of the range. However, Arora and Melton state that their burned area estimates do not include contributions from agricultural burning, which are a significant proportion of emissions at mid-latitudes in LMfire, suggesting that LMfire represents the plausible upper limit of PI emissions in many regions. A regional comparison of modelled burned area with the Arora and Melton dataset

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">24</xref>
 </sup> suggests that the distribution of burned area, and hence emissions, in LMfire is appropriate, although the magnitude of the emissions is high.
