<p id="Par20" class="p">The charcoal record (see Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>) suggests that fire occurrence in the tropics (30° S to 30° N) increased slightly from the PI to the PD. Moreover, in general agreement with Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>, fire occurrence in the extra-tropical regions (&gt;30° S and N) in the PI was similar to or larger than in the year 2000

 </sup>. The charcoal record suggests fire occurrence in the NH mid-latitude region (25–45° N) is lower in the PD compared to the PI, due mainly to a decrease in charcoal deposition occurring over the last few decades, the same region in which the fire models (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>) predict the largest decrease in PD emissions compared to the PI, and where tree-ring-based reconstructions of fire activity for western North America also suggests a very rapid decline in fire occurrence from the PI to the PD
