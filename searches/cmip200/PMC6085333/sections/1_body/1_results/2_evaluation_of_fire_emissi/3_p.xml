 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> also compares SIMFIRE-BLAZE and LMfire modelled BC emissions for the PD climate (see Methods) along with the range in BC emissions derived from all three commonly used fire inventories (The Global Fire Emissions Database: GFED4, The Global Fire Assimilation System: GFAS and the Fire INventory from NCAR: FINN). SIMFIRE-BLAZE and LMfire emissions generally lie within the decadal-mean emission range of the three observation-based datasets, although LMfire emissions are consistently higher in SH regions compared to decadal mean values from all other datasets. We also note that the two observation-based inventories can differ by up to a factor 3 themselves, and therefore a factor 2 difference at mid-latitudes between SIMFIRE-BLAZE and LMfire emissions in the PI reflects the uncertainty which also hinders accurate estimates of PD emissions.
