<p id="Par9" class="p">The four PI fire emission datasets (AeroCom, CMIP6, SIMFIRE-BLAZE and LMfire) produce a wide range of aerosol and trace gas emissions (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>). Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> shows that when assuming a positive relationship between human population and fire occurrence (AeroCom scenario), fire emissions are consistently lower in the PI than the PD, because emissions are scaled only by population changes in most regions. Global annual mean PI CMIP6 carbonaceous fire emissions are 48% higher than in the AeroCom dataset, with major increases over Northern Hemisphere (NH) mid-latitudes and tropical Africa, but are still lower than the PD. In contrast, although the LMfire and SIMFIRE-BLAZE modelled PI fire emissions differ substantially, they are both much higher than PD emissions at almost all latitudes outside the tropics, where continental pristine aerosol environments are both spatially and temporally rare

 </sup>. The majority of PD fire emissions originate in tropical savannah and grassland regions

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>
 </sup> where herbaceous biomass accumulates during the wet season and provides large quantities of finely structured fuel that can readily burn during the dry season. In the PI a significant fraction of global emissions also originate from NH mid-latitudes, while in the PD passive and active human fire suppression is highly active (e.g., &gt;99.5% fire ignitions are actively suppressed in the US

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">32</xref>
 </sup>). Different representations of anthropogenic land cover and land use change over the industrial period between the two fire models (see Methods) contribute to the significant differences in modelled estimates of PI burned area (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref>) and emissions (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">4</xref>); particularly between 30° N and 45° N where agricultural emissions present in LMfire but not SIMFIRE-BLAZE are estimated to contribute up to 25% (Eurasia: 37%, North America: 1%) of total fire emissions, and during the boreal spring season. Recent studies suggest that mid-latitude Eurasian post-harvest agricultural burning emissions have been strongly underestimated in both the PI

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">34</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">35</xref>
 </sup>, so the inclusion of these sources in LMfire, but not SIMFIRE-BLAZE, adds significantly to the total emissions between 30° N and 45° N, but further research is needed to determine their accuracy.
