 </sup>. Using AeroCom emissions in the aerosol model results in a PD/PI atmospheric BC ratio that is a factor 2.2–3.1 higher at NEEM and a factor 5.6–8.6 higher at D4 than the measured BC ratio in the ice. These ratios suggest that assuming a positive relationship between human population density and fire occurrence results in PI fire emissions that are too low. Using CMIP6 emissions results in a PD/PI BC ratio that is a factor of 1.3–1.9 higher at NEEM and a factor of 2.9–4.5 higher at D4 than the measured BC ratio. Using LMfire emissions results in a PD/PI BC ratio that is a factor 1.7–2.4 lower at NEEM and between a factor of 1.3 higher and a factor of 1.1 lower at D4, while using SIMFIRE-BLAZE emissions results in a PD/PI BC ratio that is between a factor of 1.0–1.5 higher at NEEM and a factor of 2.0–3.1 higher at D4, than the measured BC ratio.
