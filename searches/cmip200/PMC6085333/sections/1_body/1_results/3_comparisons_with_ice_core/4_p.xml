 </sup>, so to compare with our model simulation in 2000 we scale the model PD concentrations by a factor of 1.6 ± 0.4 in line with the CMIP6 changes in anthropogenic emissions, and the uncertainty, over this period (see Methods). The global aerosol model with AeroCom fire emissions results in a PD/PI BC ratio at the altitude of the measurement site that is a factor 21.2 (15.7–26.2) larger than the measured ratio in the ice core (0.6), again consistent with the hypothesis of fire emissions being too low in the PI with a positive scaling of fire occurrence with population density. Using CMIP6 emissions results in a PD/PI ratio that is a factor of 11.5 (8.5–14.2) higher than the measured BC ratio. Using LMfire emissions results in a PD/PI BC ratio that is a factor 1.2 (1.0–1.6) lower than measured, while using SIMFIRE-BLAZE emissions results in a PD/PI BC ratio that is 2.2 (1.6–2.7) higher than measured. Aerosol model results using fire model estimates of PI fire emissions are much closer to the measured PI to PD change in BC concentrations than the aerosol model results using the AeroCom and CMIP6 datasets, which predict far larger increases in BC from PI to PD.
