<p id="Par18" class="p">Due to the short atmospheric lifetimes of aerosol and soluble gases, ice cores store local-to-hemispheric-scale changes and contain many uncertainties as a proxy for fire emissions (see Methods). Nevertheless, we find that the changes in BC recorded in ice cores at four sites in very different environments are inconsistent with the assumption that fire emissions were significantly lower in the PI than in the PD, especially over North America and Europe. Compared to using fire emissions from the CMIP6 dataset, incorporating fire model emissions within the aerosol model results in closer agreement with the measured PD/PI ratio of total BC.</p>
