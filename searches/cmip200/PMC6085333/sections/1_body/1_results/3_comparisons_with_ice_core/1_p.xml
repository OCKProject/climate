Our hypothesis is that a modelled PD/PI ratio that is higher than measured indicates that PI emissions are too low in the model compared to the PD. Although absolute BC deposition is uncertain

Together these ice core records provide an estimate of how fire emissions have changed within, or downwind of, NH regions of intensive land use and land cover change over the last 200 years
