 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>), global aerosol model simulations of the PD/PI ratio in BC concentrations using LMfire and SIMFIRE-BLAZE fire emissions are in closer agreement with ice core measurements than the global aerosol model simulation which uses the CMIP6 fire emissions dataset, although CMIP6 is an important improvement on the AeroCom dataset.
