 </sup> (see Methods), BC concentrations averaged for 1950-to-1980 are a factor of 2.9 higher than in 1750 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Total BC concentrations at this site are significantly higher in the PD than in the PI due to additional industrial emissions that are not present in the PI. Similarly to North America, European industrial BC emissions have been decreasing significantly since 1960

 </sup>. In Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> we account for this known change by increasing the global aerosol model PD concentrations of BC by a factor of 2.0 ± 0.5 (see Methods). The global aerosol model with AeroCom fire emissions results in a PD/PI BC ratio, at the altitude of the measurement site, that is a factor 4.1 (3.1–5.2) larger than the PD/PI BC ratio recorded in the ice core; again, consistent with AeroCom PI emissions being too low. Using CMIP6 emissions results in a PD/PI ratio that is a factor of 2.7 (2.0–3.3) higher. Using LMfire emissions results in a PD/PI BC ratio that is a factor 1.6 (1.3–2.2) lower than the ratio recorded in the ice core, while using SIMFIRE-BLAZE emissions results in a PD/PI BC ratio that is 1.3 (1.0–1.6) higher than the ratio recorded in the ice core.
