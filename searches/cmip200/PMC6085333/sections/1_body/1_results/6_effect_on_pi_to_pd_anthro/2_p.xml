 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> also shows the aerosol direct radiative forcing between the PI and PD for each fire emission scenario. Each PI fire emission experiment results in a similar spatial pattern of direct forcing. The global mean differences are much smaller than for the cloud albedo forcing, ranging from −0.68 W m

 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> for LMfire PI fire emissions (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>). The sensitivity of the direct radiative forcing to PI fire emissions is weaker than for the cloud albedo forcing. This is caused by (i) the more linear response of the natural aerosol direct radiative effect compared to its cloud albedo effect
