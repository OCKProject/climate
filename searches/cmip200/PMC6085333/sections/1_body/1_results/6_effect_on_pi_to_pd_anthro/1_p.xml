 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> shows the radiative forcing due to changes in cloud albedo between the PI and PD using PI fire emissions from the CMIP6 dataset or the fire model datasets (see Methods). Other cloud adjustments caused by the changes in aerosol were not included, but are likely to enhance the albedo effect we calculate

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">8</xref>). This suggests that in order to improve the accuracy of radiative forcing estimates in climate models, it is more important to reduce the structural uncertainty between fire models than to improve our understanding of natural variability in PI fire emissions.
