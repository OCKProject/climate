<p id="Par28" class="p">A realistic lower bound for PI fire emissions is currently unknown, but analysis of ice cores, charcoal records and tree-rings suggests it will be nearer to SIMFIRE-BLAZE modelled estimates than those within the AeroCom or CMIP6 datasets. LMfire emissions are approximately double SIMFIRE-BLAZE in most mid-latitude regions due to the addition of agricultural emissions and a longer fire season, which both increase annual mean burned area and hence modelled emission estimates. We therefore suggest that in many extra-tropical regions LMfire represents a plausible upper limit, particularly in the Arctic and semiarid regions of the mid-latitude NH. The exception is temperate North America, a region important for the baseline forcing, where reconstructions based on paleoenvironmental archives are in closest agreement with LMfire of all examined datasets. However, LMfire emissions from Australia are close to an order of magnitude higher than SIMFIRE-BLAZE and should be treated cautiously in the absence of supporting evidence, in particular the impact that colonisation has had on fire activity within Australia which could be large. The upper limit of potential fire activity in most tropical regions is also currently unknown.</p>
