Improved characterisation of natural emissions and their radiative effects can therefore increase the accuracy of global climate model projections. Here we show that revised assumptions about pre-industrial fire activity result in significantly increased aerosol concentrations in the pre-industrial atmosphere. Revised global model simulations predict a 35% reduction in the calculated global mean cloud albedo forcing over the Industrial Era (1750&#x02013;2000 CE) compared to estimates using emissions data from the Sixth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project. An estimated upper limit to pre-industrial fire emissions results in a much greater (91%) reduction in forcing. When compared to 26 other uncertain parameters or inputs in our model, pre-industrial fire emissions are by far the single largest source of uncertainty in pre-industrial aerosol concentrations, and hence in our understanding of the magnitude of the historical radiative forcing due to anthropogenic aerosol emissions.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">Several lines of evidence suggest that fire activity was much greater in the preindustrial era than currently assumed in climate models.

The present-day (PD) pattern of fire (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) is relatively well understood based on global satellite measurements of burned area<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. However, despite the importance of fire in the climate system in the past and present<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, current understanding of fire occurrence in the late pre-industrial Holocene (PI) is limited<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.

Globally, most fire ignitions are caused by humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, which makes a positive scaling of total burned area, and hence total fire emissions, with human population density logical at first. However, recent analysis of global fire occurrence shows that, at a global scale, burned area declines with increasing population density<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> due to land use change<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. For example, observationally based estimates of burned area over the last few decades suggest a global decline of 1&#x02013;2% per year<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, with a maximum of 3&#x02013;6% per year regional decline in Europe and Australia/New Zealand<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. On longer timescales Mallek et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> suggest that PD (1984&#x02013;2009) burned area is just 14% of PI (1500&#x02013;1850) burned area in California, and Arora and Melton<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> suggest an overall global decline of 25&#x02013;30% in burned area since the PI. This decline in fire is a result of human activity: e.g., passive fire suppression from landscape fragmentation limits the spread of fires<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, while active fire suppression management and legislation aimed to improve air quality offset any potential anthropogenic increase in accidental fire ignitions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Therefore, advances in global fire modelling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> suggest a significantly different pattern of fire occurrence under PI conditions (modelled PI burned area estimates: Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>), with consequently higher aerosol emissions than previously estimated.</p><p id="Par5">A large number of global fire models exist, of which six contributed to the creation of historical fire emissions in the CMIP6 dataset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.

Therefore, CMIP6 probably underestimates PI fire emissions.</p><p id="Par6">Here we use two fire models driven by distinct philosophies of the relationship between humans and fire to simulate a range of PI fire emissions which are consistent with current knowledge of how humans influence global fire occurrence, as well as representing the uncertainty in anthropogenic land cover and land use change from the PI to the PD (see Methods). Emissions in the two fire models are much greater than in the AeroCom and CMIP6 PI datasets and are more in line with the trends predicted from paleofire proxy records. When used in a global aerosol model, the fire models result in a substantial reduction in the magnitude of anthropogenic aerosol forcing over the Industrial Era compared to the CMIP6 fire emission scenario; which has not been accounted for in climate models.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Modelling pre-industrial fire emissions</title><p id="Par7">To quantify how assumptions concerning PI fire emissions affect historical aerosol concentrations, and how this change in the PI aerosol baseline affects anthropogenic radiative forcing, we use four datasets of black carbon (BC), particulate organic matter (POM) and sulphur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) fire emissions in a global aerosol model (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). We define the PI to be 1750 and fire emissions are defined as the sum of emissions from natural wildfires as well as fires resulting from anthropogenic activity.</p><p id="Par8">The principal fire modelling dataset is calculated using the LPJ-GUESS-SIMFIRE-BLAZE model. To calculate burned area BLAZE incorporates the empirically optimised SIMFIRE (SIMple FIRE) model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. SIMFIRE-BLAZE is then configured to run under PI conditions, but does not explicitly simulate PI agricultural burning. We also calculate PI fire emissions using the LPJ-LMfire<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> model. LMfire is currently the only fire model specifically designed to simulate human-caused fires and natural wildfires in the PI period. LMfire reproduces long-term observed PD boreal fire behaviour within central Alaska<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, which is the PD region where fire activity is most analogous to the PI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. We compare PI fire emissions from these two fire models with emissions from the CMIP6 dataset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, which is the most recent fire emission dataset for use within global climate and Earth system models. The CMIP6 dataset for both the PI and PD combines information from satellite measurements, fire emission proxy records and six fire models from the Fire Model Intercomparison Project (FireMIP; see Methods). To assess how the CMIP6 fire dataset and our new fire models compare to earlier understanding of PI fire emissions we also compare to the Dentener et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> 1750 dataset adopted by AeroCom. A global aerosol model was then used to quantify the changes in PI aerosol concentrations resulting from each fire emission dataset. We also calculate the effect on the aerosol radiative forcing between the PI and PD assuming a common observation-based fire emission dataset for the PD, which is also used in CMIP6 (see Methods).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Evaluation of fire emissions</title><p id="Par9">The four PI fire emission datasets (AeroCom, CMIP6, SIMFIRE-BLAZE and LMfire) produce a wide range of aerosol and trace gas emissions (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows that when assuming a positive relationship between human population and fire occurrence (AeroCom scenario), fire emissions are consistently lower in the PI than the PD, because emissions are scaled only by population changes in most regions. Global annual mean PI CMIP6 carbonaceous fire emissions are 48% higher than in the AeroCom dataset, with major increases over Northern Hemisphere (NH) mid-latitudes and tropical Africa, but are still lower than the PD. In contrast, although the LMfire and SIMFIRE-BLAZE modelled PI fire emissions differ substantially, they are both much higher than PD emissions at almost all latitudes outside the tropics, where continental pristine aerosol environments are both spatially and temporally rare<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. The majority of PD fire emissions originate in tropical savannah and grassland regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> where herbaceous biomass accumulates during the wet season and provides large quantities of finely structured fuel that can readily burn during the dry season. In the PI a significant fraction of global emissions also originate from NH mid-latitudes, while in the PD passive and active human fire suppression is highly active (e.g., &#x0003e;99.5% fire ignitions are actively suppressed in the US<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>). Different representations of anthropogenic land cover and land use change over the industrial period between the two fire models (see Methods) contribute to the significant differences in modelled estimates of PI burned area (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>) and emissions (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>); particularly between 30&#x000b0;&#x02009;N and 45&#x000b0;&#x02009;N where agricultural emissions present in LMfire but not SIMFIRE-BLAZE are estimated to contribute up to 25% (Eurasia: 37%, North America: 1%) of total fire emissions, and during the boreal spring season. Recent studies suggest that mid-latitude Eurasian post-harvest agricultural burning emissions have been strongly underestimated in both the PI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> and PD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, so the inclusion of these sources in LMfire, but not SIMFIRE-BLAZE, adds significantly to the total emissions between 30&#x000b0;&#x02009;N and 45&#x000b0;&#x02009;N, but further research is needed to determine their accuracy.</p><p id="Par10">Depending on the emitted species, modelled total global fire emissions in the PI are estimated to be between approximately two-and-a-half and five times higher than those in the CMIP6 dataset (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>), reflecting the large contribution to the uncertainty in fire emissions from fire modelling processes and assumptions about land use change (see Methods). These differences also lie well outside the perturbations assumed in multi-model sensitivity studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, and have a different spatial distribution due to differences in fire emissions corresponding with changes in the location of PI fire occurrence rather than a uniform global increase. Seasonal patterns in fire emissions are similar between fire models, except in spring where LMfire simulates significantly more emissions than SIMFIRE-BLAZE in both hemispheres (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). Overall, the fire model simulations suggest that a large source of PI aerosol emissions is currently missing from climate models and the CMIP6 experiments.</p><p id="Par11">Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> also compares SIMFIRE-BLAZE and LMfire modelled BC emissions for the PD climate (see Methods) along with the range in BC emissions derived from all three commonly used fire inventories (The Global Fire Emissions Database: GFED4, The Global Fire Assimilation System: GFAS and the Fire INventory from NCAR: FINN). SIMFIRE-BLAZE and LMfire emissions generally lie within the decadal-mean emission range of the three observation-based datasets, although LMfire emissions are consistently higher in SH regions compared to decadal mean values from all other datasets. We also note that the two observation-based inventories can differ by up to a factor 3 themselves, and therefore a factor 2 difference at mid-latitudes between SIMFIRE-BLAZE and LMfire emissions in the PI reflects the uncertainty which also hinders accurate estimates of PD emissions.</p><p id="Par12">The ability of a model to reproduce PD emissions does not necessarily mean that it also produces realistic results under a different past climate using different boundary conditions and where emissions are controlled by different processes. Hence, we advocate that model performance is best evaluated against what we know about the PI, rather than the PD.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Comparisons with ice core records</title><p id="Par13">BC deposited on glaciers and recovered in ice cores can be used to infer the relative change in atmospheric total BC concentrations that occurred between the PI and the PD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Here we evaluate NH changes in BC concentrations in each dataset. We compare modelled PD/PI BC atmospheric concentration ratios (see Methods, Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>) to measured BC ice core ratios at four ice core locations: two in Greenland, and one in each of North America and Europe (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). To minimise the large uncertainties associated with the absolute deposition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, we analysed only the ratio of PI to PD BC in the cores, assuming that trends can be more accurately modelled than absolute values. Our hypothesis is that a modelled PD/PI ratio that is higher than measured indicates that PI emissions are too low in the model compared to the PD. Although absolute BC deposition is uncertain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> (see later discussion) we assume that the controlling factor in the PD/PI ratio across multiple independent sites will be the trend in emissions. Together these ice core records provide an estimate of how fire emissions have changed within, or downwind of, NH regions of intensive land use and land cover change over the last 200 years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Present-day/pre-industrial ratio in ice core and modelled black carbon concentrations.

These monthly anomalies are then detrended using a robust loess regression filter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup> with a bandwidth of 30 years. Next, we interpolated the detrended anomalies for each meteorological variable to 0.5&#x000b0; spatial resolution. Next, a climate driver dataset was generated from a 1080-year climate dataset by dividing the 140-year detrended climate anomalies into twelve 30-year blocks at 10-year intervals. Anomalies were then sampled using a pseudo-random scheme where once a block was chosen it was not selected again until all of the other remaining blocks have been selected. In order to generate a 1080-year timeseries 36 blocks were selected, i.e., each block was used three times but appeared in a different order each time. Finally, each anomaly timeseries was added to its complementary baseline climatological mean climate field, and used the resulting 1080-year (12960-month) climate data input file to run LMfire.

Because these are PD regions known to be subject to large-scale industrial fire suppression efforts, we accounted for this fire suppression by further correcting the LMfire output in a model postprocessing step. To identify regions affected by potential model bias, we compared modelled burned area with GFED4s at the level of GFED regions, with Europe further subdivided into North and South at 45&#x000b0; N (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>). Within those regions where the discrepancy between modelled and observed burned area was &#x02265;90%, i.e., the USA, southern Europe, and Middle East, we assumed that the primary reason for the discrepancy was active fire suppression. To correct this model PD bias in these regions, we scaled the modelled BC emissions by the ratio of GFED4s observed to LMfire modelled burned area calculated at the GFED regional level. This resulted in a slightly &#x0003c;10% decrease to the global BC annual emission flux. In all other regions, we used modelled BC emissions without bias correction because the discrepancy was smaller and we could not justify industrial fire suppression as being the potential primary cause of model-data mismatch.
