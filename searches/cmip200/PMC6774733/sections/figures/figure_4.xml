  <p class="p">Proportion of years with extremely low or high precipitation (lower or upper 20th percentile, respectively) that are also extremely low or high growth years after using a Cohen’s κ correction to account for chance co-occurrence. Responses to extreme precipitation were calculated from 1895 (the start of the PRISM precipitation estimates) through the ending year of tree-ring measurements, which varied by site but was never earlier than 1970.
