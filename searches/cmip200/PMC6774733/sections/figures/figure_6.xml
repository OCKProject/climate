   <bold class="bold">A</bold>) Cumulative and probability density functions (lines and bars, respectively) of the gamma distribution fit to regional cool-season precipitation. The 1901–1930 precipitation distribution was fit based on historical mean regional precipitation from PRISM, whereas 1981–2010 precipitation distribution was simulated with the same mean as 1901–1930 but with the observed increase in variability (∆CVP

   <bold class="bold">B</bold>) Violin and box plots of 10,000 cool-season precipitation realizations derived from the gamma distributions in (A), which were used to simulate growth anomalies based on the observed sensitivity of regional growth to precipitation. The empirical cumulative density functions from these growth simulations are shown in (
   <bold class="bold">C</bold>), with accompanying violin and box plots in (
   <bold class="bold">D</bold>).
