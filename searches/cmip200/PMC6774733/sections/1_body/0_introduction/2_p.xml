<p class="p">How vegetated ecosystems respond to these hydroclimatic changes remains unknown, with important implications for ecosystem services, hydrological feedbacks via changes in evapotranspiration, and biophysical and biogeochemical feedbacks to the climate system. Evidence suggests that higher VPD, which can initiate stomatal closure and increase hydraulic stress, generally leads to lower assimilation and plant growth (

 </xref>). However, increases in VPD will co-occur with likely increases in the variability of precipitation, with uncertain consequences for ecosystem carbon uptake. If plant growth and primary production respond asymmetrically or nonlinearly to precipitation, then an increase in precipitation variability can lead to long-term growth trends even with negligible changes in mean precipitation (

 </xref>). If dry extremes reduce growth more than wet extremes increase growth, then an increase in precipitation variability will result in reduced growth during dry years that is not offset by increased growth during wet years, leading to both increased interannual variability and long-term growth declines.
