<p class="p">Experimental manipulations and multi-decade observational datasets have been used to examine these asymmetries in growth responses to precipitation, particularly for grass and shrub species (

Moreover, previous research has generally focused on annual precipitation, but in many cases, forest growth and productivity have distinct responses to sub-annual variation in water supply (

Here, we use more than 100 years of tree-ring widths from across the conterminous United States (fig. S1) in combination with historical, high-resolution precipitation estimates to examine asymmetries in the relationship between tree growth and precipitation. Further, we examine how these asymmetries vary as a function of (i) species, (ii) seasonality of precipitation, and (iii) regional aridity. Last, we examine the implications of asymmetric precipitation-growth relationships in the context of a more variable hydroclimate. Because precipitation variability has increased and will likely continue to increase, a more robust understanding of the impacts of increasing precipitation variability on tree growth is a key step toward accurate forecasts of climate change impacts on forest ecosystems.
