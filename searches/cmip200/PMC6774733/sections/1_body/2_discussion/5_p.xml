<p class="p">We note, however, that the tree-ring database used here likely includes a disproportionate number of sites under relatively high stress, which can accentuate and overestimate the observed growth response to climate variability (
 <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">34</italic>
 </xref>). Our findings thus likely represent an upper threshold on asymmetric responses of tree growth to precipitation variability. In addition, the tree-ring database does not adequately represent the structure of eastern U.S. forests (
 <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">35</italic>
 </xref>), and the growth responses to climate variability in this region tend to be highly complex (
 <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">36</italic>
 </xref>). Our findings therefore pertain most strongly to dryland conifer forests of the western United States, while greater uncertainty likely exists in the more mesic and diverse forests of the eastern United States. We also caution that our findings pertain only to the time scales (3- to 6-month seasons) that were explicitly examined in this research. Although not common, growth responses to precipitation can be dominated by a single month (
 <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">37</italic>
 </xref>), so the seasonal aggregations used here could mute some subseasonal responses of tree growth to precipitation. Additional research efforts are therefore needed to better understand how sensitivity to precipitation variability varies along stress gradients and across temporal scales while better capturing responses of structurally and taxonomically diverse eastern U.S. forests. Future research is also needed to examine the temporal stability of these relationships and possible interactions between decadal-scale climate fluctuations (e.g., the El Niño–Southern Oscillation or the Pacific Decadal Oscillation) and secular trends in precipitation variability that could result in protracted periods of unfavorable growth conditions.
