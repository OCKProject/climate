<p class="p">Our study sheds new light on the distinct regional and seasonal trajectories that changing precipitation variability could have on U.S. forests. First, while many sites, particularly those in northern or high elevation regions, showed either little evidence of precipitation limitation or symmetric responses to precipitation (though they may respond differently at time scales other than those examined here), we find that asymmetric relationships to precipitation dominated the semiarid forests of the western United States, a region that has experienced a large historical increase in precipitation variability. These dryland forests are therefore likely to be most susceptible to any further increases in precipitation variability as the climate continues to warm. Some eastern oak species (post oak and bur oak in particular) also exhibit widespread asymmetric responses to precipitation that may portend future vulnerability to increases in precipitation variability. Second, we find that, with few exceptions, increases in cool-season precipitation variability (particularly during December to February) and spring precipitation variability are more likely to result in negative growth trends than increases in summer precipitation variability. While tree growth in much of the United States responded positively to changes in warm-season/summer precipitation, the vast majority of sites and species responded linearly (or symmetrically) to precipitation in these seasons, suggesting that increases in precipitation variability during these seasons would increase the variability of growth, but not the overall mean growth. The major exceptions are the bur oak sites of the central United States, which responded asymmetrically to warm-season precipitation at &gt;60% of sites and to summer precipitation at &gt;40% of sites.</p>
