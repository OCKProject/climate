<p class="p">Previous studies have documented long-term declines in forest growth and increases in forest mortality largely attributable to higher VPD and warmer temperatures, particularly in the southwestern United States (

 </xref>). Our findings suggest an additional climatic driver of declining tree growth that could further reinforce stresses resulting from a change in mean precipitation or VPD. An increase in precipitation variability alone, particularly during winter and spring months, can reduce growth of many U.S. tree species, especially those in the semiarid United States, due to asymmetric growth responses to precipitation, resulting in both higher growth variability and lower mean growth. The ecological consequences of this asymmetry between precipitation variability and tree growth in a warmer and more variable climate could be quite severe, as decreases in radial growth are linked to higher mortality risk (
