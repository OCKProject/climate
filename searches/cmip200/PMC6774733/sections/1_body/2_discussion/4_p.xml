The combination of higher precipitation variability with higher temperatures, higher VPD, and reduced snowpack could create novel climates that many species have not experienced during the comparatively stable Holocene. Unless plants are able to acclimate to these changes, or unless the negative impacts of higher VPD and CVP can be offset by positive impacts of longer growing seasons and/or CO
