<p class="p">Why might tree growth, as expressed in tree-ring width, respond asymmetrically to precipitation? We suggest three possible hydrological and physiological mechanisms (

 </xref>,

 </xref>). First, when precipitation is high, soil moisture levels may approach saturation and a larger fraction of the precipitation may end up as runoff, which would be unavailable to plants, resulting in little change in growth. Second, when precipitation is plentiful, plants may be limited by other factors (e.g., growing season length, nutrient availability, or incident photosynthetically active radiation), resulting in diminishing returns for any increase in precipitation above a threshold. Last, if moisture is plentiful, then plants may alter the allocation of photosynthate to organs other than the stem or store the excess photosynthate as nonstructural carbohydrates, which could potentially allow the positive effects of high precipitation to carry over into subsequent years. If the widespread asymmetries between precipitation and growth observed in this study are attributable to changes in carbon allocation, then growth may be relatively more resilient to increased precipitation variability than suggested solely by examining tree-ring widths.
