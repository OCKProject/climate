<p class="p">Asymmetric relationships between growth and precipitation could result in long-term negative growth trends if coupled to an increase in precipitation variability. Historically, there is clear evidence that these conditions co-occurred in the U.S. Southwest, where both a large increase in CVP (

 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figs. 2</xref> to 
 <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>) were observed. We therefore simulated the impact of the historical increase in precipitation variability, independent of a change in mean precipitation, on tree growth across this region. To examine potential impacts of the increased CVP on growth, we regressed a mean normalized growth index for the region (Materials and Methods) on mean regional cool-season precipitation, which explained about 61% of the regional growth variability, with a distinct negative asymmetry as observed in the site-level responses (fig. S8). To simulate long-term growth responses to the observed increase in CVP across the region, we generated two long (10,000-year) synthetic runs of precipitation drawn from (i) a gamma distribution fit to observed early 20th century precipitation (1901–1930) and (ii) a gamma distribution with the same mean as the early 20th century but with the elevated CVP observed during 1981–2010. We then simulated growth under these precipitation scenarios using the fitted regional precipitation-growth relationship plus white noise based on draws from the normal distribution defined from the residuals of the regional precipitation-growth relationship (fig. S8 and Materials and Methods).
