<p class="p">We assessed changes in interannual precipitation variability during the October to March “cool season” and April to September “warm season” using the coefficient of variation of precipitation (CVP; Materials and Methods) (

  <italic class="italic">19</italic>
 </xref>). The CVP varied spatially across the conterminous United States (
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>), with high variability (relative to mean precipitation) in the dry southwestern United States and lower variability in more mesic regions. In general, variability did not change substantially in regions with low CVP, such as most of the eastern and Pacific Northwest of the United States (
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 1, C to F</xref>). In contrast, regions with high CVP became even more variable during the 20th century, particularly the U.S. Southwest (
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 1, C to F</xref>). While the density of meteorological stations used to estimate gridded precipitation is relatively sparse during the earliest period (1901–1930), gridded and station precipitation datasets are in close agreement on observed changes in CVP (
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 1, C to F</xref>, and fig. S2), and the strong increase in CVP in the Southwest is robust to choice of time period, with a nearly monotonic increase in CVP over the historical record (fig. S3). Precipitation projections from an ensemble of models included in CMIP5, statistically downscaled using bias correction and spatial disaggregation (

 </xref>,

  <italic class="italic">21</italic>
 </xref>), show further increases in CVP under the RCP8.5 scenario over the next century, with large projected increases in cool-season CVP over the U.S. Southwest (
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 1G</xref> and fig. S4) and warm-season CVP in both Texas and southern California (
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 1H</xref> and fig. S5). While there is some disagreement among the models on the magnitude (and in some regions, the direction) of the change in CVP (figs. S4 and S5), the majority of the models agree on a large increase in CVP in the southwestern United States. Theory also predicts that warming will drive increases in precipitation variability (

 </xref>) and “hydroclimatic intensity” (
 <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">22</italic>
 </xref>) due to the physical relationship between temperature and the water holding capacity of the atmosphere. Further, global climate models generally underestimate the effects of warming on extreme hydroclimatic events (
