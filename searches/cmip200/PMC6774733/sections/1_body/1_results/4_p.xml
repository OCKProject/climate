<p class="p">Widespread asymmetric relationships between tree growth and precipitation, especially during the cool season in semiarid regions of the western United States, meant that extremely dry years were very likely to be years with extremely low growth (
 <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>; Materials and Methods). However, growth was far less likely to be extremely high following extremely wet cool seasons (
 <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 4B</xref>): Only 91 sites—mostly in southern California, Arizona, and New Mexico—exhibited significant overlap between extremely wet cool-season conditions and extremely high growth. In other words, while tree growth was very likely to be much reduced during extremely dry years, tree growth was not necessarily proportionately increased during extremely wet years, which is consistent with a fundamental principle of dendrochronology concerning the use of narrow rings as marker years for cross-dating samples (

 </xref>). Mean cool-season precipitation and mean cool-season temperature were important predictors of tree growth sensitivity to extreme precipitation, with drier and warmer sites exhibiting much stronger negative responses to extreme dryness relative to wetter and cooler sites (
 <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 5A</xref> and table S1). Even when accounting for differences in site climatologies, there were significant differences among species in their responsiveness to cool-season extremes (fig. S6, A and B, and table S1). These patterns generally did not hold as strongly for the April to September warm season, during which tree growth was less responsive to precipitation extremes (
 <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 4, C and D</xref>) irrespective of site-level mean precipitation (
 <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 5, C and D</xref>, and table S1), although warmer sites did tend to be more sensitive to extreme precipitation than cooler sites (table S1). However, the relative lack of response to warm-season extremes was likely due to relatively little summer precipitation limitation (fig. S7, G and H), whereas many sites, particularly those in the central and western United States, did respond significantly to spring precipitation extremes (fig. S7, E and F).
