<p class="p">Responses of tree growth to warm-season precipitation were predominantly symmetric (
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 2, C and D</xref>), with the exception of bur oak (
 <italic class="italic">Quercus macrocarpa</italic>), which responded asymmetrically to warm-season precipitation at more than 60% of sites (
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 2D</xref>). Other eastern oak species [white oak (
 <italic class="italic">Quercus alba</italic>) and post oak] were also limited by warm-season precipitation at roughly 80% or more of the sites, but these responses were predominantly symmetric. Dry-adapted western U.S. species—including western juniper, ponderosa pine, piñon pine, Douglas-fir, and blue oak—were positively correlated with warm-season precipitation at more than 60% of sites (
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 2D</xref>), but these relationships were also predominantly symmetric. Of the overlapping 3-month meteorological seasons, spring (March to May) precipitation was a particularly important driver of growth nearly everywhere except in the northeastern United States, west of the Cascade Mountains, and surrounding the Great Lakes (
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 3, E and F</xref>). Nearly all central and western oak sites (&gt;80% of post oak, blue oak, and bur oak sites) and most western conifer sites (&gt;70% of western juniper, ponderosa pine, piñon pine, and Douglas-fir sites) responded significantly, whether symmetrically or asymmetrically, to spring precipitation (
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 3F</xref>). Spring precipitation was also the most important season for bald cypress growth, with more than 90% of sites responded significantly (but mostly symmetrically) to precipitation during this season (
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 3F</xref>). By comparison, growth of most species did not show evidence of summer (June to August) precipitation limitation (
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 3, G and H</xref>), although in some cases (such as in southern California) this was probably driven not by lack of water stress but by the absence of summer precipitation in this Mediterranean climate. Of those species with at least 25 sites in the U.S. International Tree-Ring Data Bank (ITRDB), only four (bur oak, white oak, post oak, and western juniper) responded significantly to summer precipitation at more than half of the sites (
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 3H</xref>). Those responses were predominantly symmetric except for bur oak, which responded asymmetrically to summer precipitation at more than 40% of sites and could therefore be particularly vulnerable to summer drought and possible increases in summer precipitation variability.
