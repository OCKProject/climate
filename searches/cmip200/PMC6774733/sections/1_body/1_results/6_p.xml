<p class="p">While the two regional cool-season precipitation simulations had the same mean precipitation (roughly 190 mm year
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>), the 1981–2010 simulation had a wider, flatter distribution with much higher probabilities of both extremely low and extremely high precipitation years (
 <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 6, A and B</xref>). The probability of cool-season precipitation of 100 mm or less in any given year more than tripled under the high variability scenario, from less than 3% during the 1901–1930 period to nearly 10% during the 1981–2010 simulation (
 <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 6A</xref>). The increased likelihood and frequency of extreme precipitation in the high CVP simulation, combined with the strong negative asymmetry in regional precipitation-growth relationships, resulted in roughly a twofold increase in the probability of mean regional growth anomalies at least 1 SD below historical norms, and this increase in the probability of low growth was not offset by an increased likelihood of high growth, which remained virtually unchanged between the two simulations (
 <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 6C</xref>). While a linear precipitation-growth relationship would result in higher variability but no change in mean growth (fig. S9), the widespread negative asymmetries in the U.S. Southwest resulted in lower mean growth under the high CVP scenario (1981–2010) relative to the early 20th century simulation (
 <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 6D</xref>). In addition, the likelihood of multiyear runs of extremely low growth was much higher under the high CVP scenario (fig. S10), which, given the disproportionate impact of extended extreme events on both carbon uptake (
