<p class="p">The implications of changing CVP for tree growth vary across the conterminous United States due to regional, seasonal, and species differences in the nature of the precipitation-growth relationship (
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figs. 2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). Tree growth at northern and high elevation sites (including 
 <italic class="italic">Tsuga</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Abies</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Picea</italic> species) showed little to no evidence of precipitation limitation (whether symmetric or asymmetric) in any season (
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figs. 2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>), so any changes in CVP in these regions are unlikely to have major effects on growth, although it is possible that growth at some of these sites may respond to precipitation at shorter or longer time scales (e.g., monthly or annual) than examined in this research. However, in the semiarid regions of the western United States, growth typically responded positively, but asymmetrically, to cool-season precipitation (
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 2A</xref>) such that increasing precipitation yields diminishing returns for growth (a “negative asymmetry”). This asymmetry was particularly pronounced for the three most common species in the U.S. tree-ring database: piñon pine (
 <italic class="italic">Pinus edulis</italic>), Douglas-fir (
 <italic class="italic">Pseudotsuga menziesii</italic>), and ponderosa pine (
 <italic class="italic">Pinus ponderosa</italic>) (
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 2B</xref>). Dividing the precipitation into shorter seasonal composites (the traditional meteorological seasons) suggests that both prior autumn (September to November; 
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>) and winter (December to February; 
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 3, C and D</xref>) precipitation contributed to the cool-season precipitation responses of these three species, although asymmetric relationships were more widespread for winter than autumn precipitation. Blue oak (
 <italic class="italic">Quercus douglasii</italic>) also responded asymmetrically to cool-season precipitation at more than 60% of sites (
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 2B</xref>), but this was driven almost entirely by strong responses to winter precipitation (
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 3, C and D</xref>), with very little contribution of prior autumn precipitation (
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>). Evidence of positive asymmetries (i.e., where increasing precipitation yields increasing growth returns) was limited to only a small number of sites across the United States, primarily consisting of western juniper (
 <italic class="italic">Juniperus occidentalis</italic>). Among central and eastern U.S. species, both post oak (
 <italic class="italic">Quercus stellata</italic>) and bald cypress (
 <italic class="italic">Taxodium distichum</italic>) showed evidence of cool-season precipitation limitation at more than 60% of sites. Bald cypress responses were mostly symmetric, but post oak responses were split nearly evenly between symmetric and negative asymmetric relationships (
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 2B</xref>), with stronger (and more asymmetric) responses to winter precipitation than to prior autumn precipitation (
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 3, A and D</xref>).
