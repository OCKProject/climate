<p class="p">To simulate the potential impacts of higher precipitation variability on growth, we generated two synthetic 10,000-year runs of cool-season precipitation variability under two scenarios: (i) based on random draws from a gamma distribution fit to early 20th century (1901–1930) observed precipitation and (ii) based on random draws from a gamma distribution with the 1901–1930 mean precipitation but with the PRISM-estimated 1981–2010 CVP (

This allowed us to simulate the potential impacts of an increase of precipitation variability alone, independent of any change in mean precipitation. We simulated growth under these scenarios by applying the fitted Southwest regional precipitation-growth relationship to the simulated precipitation time series, with noise simulated with random draws from a normal distribution with a mean of zero and variance defined by the residuals of the regional precipitation-growth model (fig. S5B). We then examined the empirical cumulative distribution functions of simulated growth under each scenario to estimate changes in long-term regional mean growth and changes in the probability of extreme low and high growth as a result of an increase in precipitation variability alone.
