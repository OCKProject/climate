<p class="p">On the basis of the above analyses, we simulated potential impacts of the historical increase in cool-season CVP on growth in the U.S. Southwest (defined as 32째N-37째N, 122째W-108째W; 
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 1A</xref>), a region characterized by high interannual precipitation variability, a large historical increase in CVP, and a distinct negative asymmetry in precipitation-growth relationships. We calculated mean annual cool-season precipitation within this region from PRISM data, as well as annual standardized growth anomalies at each site, which were averaged together to form a regional growth index. We then fit a regional precipitation-growth relationship for the Southwest following the same methods described above for the site-level relationships, and examined the fit of the model as well as the distribution, serial autocorrelation, and heteroskedasticity of the residuals (fig. S6). A Lilliefors test of normality failed to reject (
