<p class="p">To assess projected change in CVP, we obtained monthly downscaled historical (1950–2005) and projected (2006–2100) simulations of precipitation under the RCP8.5 scenario from 32 models included in CMIP5 (

 </xref>), using only a single ensemble member (r1i1p1) per model to avoid overrepresentation of models with larger ensembles (
