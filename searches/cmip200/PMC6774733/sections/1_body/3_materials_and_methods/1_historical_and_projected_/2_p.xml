<p class="p">Because the number of stations used to develop the gridded PRISM precipitation product was not constant through time, changes in station density could contribute to systematic bias and spurious long-term trends (

 </xref>) as further confirmation of the CVP change and to assess whether the PRISM-estimated changes in CVP were an artifact of the interpolation process. The USHCN- and PRISM-estimated changes in CVP showed similar spatial patterns and magnitudes (

 <italic class="italic">R</italic> = 0.69 for cool-season ΔCVP and 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic> = 0.74 for warm-season ΔCVP), although the PRISM-estimated ΔCVP was slightly higher than the USHCN-estimated ΔCVP at the same locations (mean biases of +2.71% and +2.80% for the cool and warm seasons, respectively).
