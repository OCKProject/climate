<p class="p">We obtained tree-ring width measurements from the ITRDB for all sites in the conterminous United States that fully covered the period 1895–1970 (a total of 1314 sites; fig. S1). All sites were used in our analysis, but we limit our discussion to the most common of the 78 species in this dataset (those with at least 25 sites) to avoid overinterpreting results for species with few replicates. While the site-level sampling designs often used in dendrochronology preclude any analyses of long-term trends in growth (

 </xref>), the relationship between annual growth and climate variability is robust to these sample design choices (

 </xref>), making the ITRDB a suitable choice for our analyses, especially given its long-term data record and high spatial density in the United States. Ring widths were detrended using a stiff smoothing spline two-thirds the length of each ring-width series (

 </xref>) in the dplR package (
 <xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">45</italic>
 </xref>) of the R statistical computing environment. Detrended ring width indices were then averaged to a site-level chronology using Tukey’s biweight robust mean and pre-whitened to remove serial autocorrelation (i.e., “residual” chronologies). Seasonal precipitation was extracted from the nearest grid cell of the PRISM climate data for model fitting and analysis.
