 <p class="p">M.K. and J.V. designed the study with inputs from T.I., C.C., S.J., G.G., E.G., J.M., M.L., N.L., A.R. and M.J.M. M.K. developed the experimental strategy and ran the GCM models. T.I. performed the linear, continuously stratified, model simulations and the probability density function of observed SST anomalies. M.K. performed the observed and CMIP5 superimposed epoch composites over the historical period and analysed the model simulation outputs. All authors contributed to the interpretation and writing.</p>
