 </sup>. We restricted our analyses to 1870–2010 as there are too many gaps in spatial sampling before 1870. The earliest part of the record (late nineteenth century) is, however, less reliable due to lower spatial resolution. We build composites using the five tropical volcanic eruptions in 1870–2010 with significant injection of sulphuric aerosol in the tropical stratosphere: Pinatubo (June 1991), El Chichón (April 1982), Mt Agung (March 1963), Santa María (October 1902) and Krakatau (August 1883). SST anomalies are computed relative to the 5-year mean preceding each eruption (to remove multidecadal variability and long-term trends) and smoothed with a 3-month Hanning filter (to filter out intraseasonal variability). To evaluate the level of statistical significance, we first count the number of events with anomalies that have the same sign, as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref>. If we assume that there is the same probability of having positive and negative signs, according to the binomial law, the likelihood for having 5 anomalies of the same sign is 0.03, i.e., corresponding to a 97% confidence level. Second, we use a Monte Carlo approach to compute the distribution for the composite value of November–January RSST average anomalies of 5 randomly picked years within the historical period, the result of which is given in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>. The probability in the Niño3.4 composite of RSST anomaly equal or above the observed 1.1 °C value is very small (0.3%). The level of statistical significance is similar in other data sets such as HadiSSTv1.1, HadSST31, ERSSTv2b2
