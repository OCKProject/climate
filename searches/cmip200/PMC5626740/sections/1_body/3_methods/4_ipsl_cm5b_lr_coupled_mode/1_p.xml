We used the low-resolution grid with 1.87° in latitude and 3.75° longitude. The oceanic component, Nucleus for European Modeling of the Ocean (NEMO) version 3.2, is an oceanic GCM with 31 vertical levels (whose thickness varies from 10 m near the surface to 500 m towards the bottom), a 2-level representation of sea ice and a mean spatial horizontal resolution of about 2° (with a refinement of the latitudinal resolution to 0.5° near the equator; ORCA2 grid).

 </sup> found that this model reproduces ENSO variability with two spectral peaks around 3–3.5 years and beyond 4 years, which is in good qualitative agreement with observations.
