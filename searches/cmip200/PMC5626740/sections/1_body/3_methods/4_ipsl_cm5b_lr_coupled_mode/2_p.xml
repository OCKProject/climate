 </sup>. Initial conditions were chosen in the IPSL-CM5B-LR standard historical run. To disentangle the role of Pinatubo eruption on ENSO evolution and avoid model spin-up, we chose restart days in the historical run with greenhouses gases and tropospheric aerosols concentrations close to the 1990s levels and more than 5 years after any volcanic eruption. We selected three restart dates corresponding to 1 June (i.e., shortly before the Pinatubo eruption) with initial conditions that would be favourable to the development of an El Niño, neutral, or La Niña phase in the absence of volcanic forcing. WWV (the volume of water above the 20 °C isotherm within 5 °N–5 °N 120 °E–80 °W) is a good precursor of the upcoming ENSO phase in nature

 </sup>. We hence selected 3 model states representing discharged, near-neutral and recharged WWV based on normalized WWV values in May. For the three initial states, 30 members (forced and unforced) were generated by adding a small white noise on the initial SST. Consistent with observations, the discharged, neutral and recharged states ensemble mean respectively produce a La Niña, near-neutral and El Niño state in the absence of volcanic forcing (see Fig.
