<p id="Par24" class="p">To help analyse the response of ENSO to volcanic forcing, a suite of short ensemble experiments was run over January 1991 to December 1993 for the Mt Pinatubo eruption (June 1991) using the IPSL-CM5B-LR

 </sup> data set. The stratospheric volcanic cloud spreads from the tropics to the poles from the start of the eruption in June 1991 until late 1992, and then slowly disappears as the aerosols are totally washed out of the atmosphere in 1993. The total AOD reaches its maximum in boreal autumn–winter 1991–1992. Corresponding control ensembles starting from the same initial conditions but without Pinatubo volcanic forcing were performed.
