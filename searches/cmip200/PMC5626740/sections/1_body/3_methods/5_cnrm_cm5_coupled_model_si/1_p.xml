<p id="Par27" class="p">To evaluate the robustness of the results obtained with the IPSL climate model, we also used the CNRM-CM5 model developed jointly by CNRM-GAME (Centre National de Recherches Météorologiques—Groupe d’études de l’Atmosphère Météorologique) and Cerfacs (Centre Européen de Recherche et de Formation Avancée). CNRM-CM5, described by Voldoire et al.

 </sup>, couples the ARPEGE-Climat (v5.2) atmosphere, NEMO (v3.2) ocean, the ISBA land surface and GELATO (v5) sea ice models through the OASIS (v3) coupler. The horizontal resolution is 1.4° in the atmosphere and 1° in the ocean (with a refinement of the latitudinal resolution to 0.5° near the equator). The model reproduces ENSO typical variability well with an ∼2‒7-year period and a seasonal phase locking with a peak occurring mostly in boreal winter, in good qualitative agreement with observations
