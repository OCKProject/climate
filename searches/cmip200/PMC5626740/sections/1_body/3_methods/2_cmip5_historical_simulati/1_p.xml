<p id="Par23" class="p">We considered 26 CMIP5 models and a total of 106 members from the CMIP5 historical simulation database

 </sup> (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>). Each member is a coupled ocean–atmosphere simulation using the CMIP5 recommended transient forcing from 1850–2005. We did not include simulations using anomalies of the solar constant to mimic volcanic forcing, interactive chemistry, carbon cycle or prognostic global aerosol models in our analyses, to restrict the potential noise associated with those extra degrees of freedom. Despite this, there is still a relatively large diversity of specified external forcings, as shown in Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>. Anomalies were computed relative to the 1961–1990 climatology of each model simulation. We analysed SST evolution in these simulations by using both the raw and relative (obtained by removing the global tropical 20 °N–20 °S mean SST) SST anomalies. For each of the 106 CMIP5 historical simulations
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>
 </sup>, we identified El Niño events from averaged Niño3.4 region monthly raw and relative SST standardized anomalies that exceed half a standard deviation over the 1870–2010 simulated period. The percentage of CMIP5 simulations displaying an El Niño-like state and its statistical significance are shown in Supplementary Figs. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref>–
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">5</xref>. Using various methods to compute the SST anomalies (removing the mean climatology of the previous 5 years, using the 1961–1990 or the 1870–2010 baseline climatology) do not affect the results. The difference between raw SST (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1a, b</xref>) and RSST (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a, b</xref>) is weak in observations, but it is large in CMIP5 models (see Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">5</xref>). The largest uncertainties in the estimates of radiative forcing from CMIP5 historical simulations occur during periods of volcanic activity
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">43</xref>
 </sup> and generally models tend to overestimate the observed post-eruption global surface cooling

 </sup>. Relying on relative SST and precipitation anomalies partly corrects this bias, so that it reveals the dynamical ENSO response to volcanic forcing in CMIP5 models.
