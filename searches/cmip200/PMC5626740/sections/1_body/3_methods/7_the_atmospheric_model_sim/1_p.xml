 </sup>. Daily fields from each of the 30 members of the coupled model ensembles starting from neutral initial conditions are used to derive a set of boundary conditions (described below) for the stand-alone atmospheric component (LMDZ AGCM) of the IPSL-CM5B model, which includes the ORCHIDEE land surface module. The stand-alone atmospheric model is run for 2 years from 1 January 1991 onward (i.e., year 0; 5.5 months before the Pinatubo eruption) to enable the atmosphere to dynamically adjust to the boundary conditions. We have first run a Control 30-member AGCM ensemble using surface boundary conditions (i.e., SST and sea ice cover) from the coupled model control ensemble without including the changes induced the volcanic aerosol. The ALL experiment follows the same protocol, but includes the stratospheric AOD evolution corresponding to the Pinatubo eruption as in the coupled model experiments and specified SST and sea ice cover from each member of the coupled model Pinatubo ensemble. The anomalies of ALL relative to the Control are almost identical when compared to the anomalies of the coupled model experiment (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">10</xref>). The small differences between the coupled and the atmospheric experiment are explained by the differences in the surface flux due to coupling
