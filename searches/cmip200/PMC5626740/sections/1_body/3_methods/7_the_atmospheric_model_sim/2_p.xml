<p id="Par30" class="p">The ATM, LAND and OCEAN experiments were respectively designed to represent the effect of aerosol forcing through its direct impact on the atmospheric structure (ATM), and indirect impacts through changes in land (LAND) or ocean (OCEAN) surface temperatures. The ATM and LAND scenarios were developed using the same protocol as in ALL but with prescribed daily SST from the Control members (i.e., with a SST that excludes the impact of volcanic aerosol forcing). Volcanic aerosol forcing is included in the ATM experiments, but the surface albedo in this experiment is modified so that continental surfaces do not cool in response to volcanic forcing (details below). In LAND, there is no prescribed aerosol forcing, but the albedo modification enforces a land surface cooling that is consistent with that of the Pinatubo coupled model experiment. This strategy has the advantage of allowing surface land temperature to vary in the presence of SST anomalies (in the OCEAN experiment), as is seen in other model experiments in the context of global warming scenario

 </sup>. This is hence more physically relevant than experiments that constrain land surface temperature

 </sup> and which can result in unphysical and exaggerated land cooling, and hence exaggerated landâ€“ocean gradients. We modify the land surface albedo to restore the atmospheric temperatures over land to that of the Control coupled model ensemble in ATM and to that of the Pinatubo coupled model ensemble in LAND.
