 <italic class="italic">α</italic> from the control and Pinatubo mean ensemble simulations and performed ATM and LAND simulations imposing the albedo in order to restore the surface temperature towards control and Pinatubo values respectively. This protocol involves a linearity assumption of assumed constant values for the feedback parameter

 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">10</xref>) however add up quite linearly to surface temperature anomalies in the ALL atmospheric or Pinatubo coupled model experiment, indicating the validity of our approach. The LAND experiment isolates the effect of volcanically induced continental cooling but does not narrow down the region that plays a key role for inducing wind anomalies over the tropical Pacific. We hence also developed a suite of additional 30-member LAND sensitivity experiments (with and without Pinatubo radiative forcing) that allows exploring the respective roles of land cooling in the tropics (LAND-T), the extra-tropics (LAND-ET), Africa (LAND-Africa), Southeast Asia (LAND-SEA) and the maritime continent (LAND-MC) only (See Supplementary Table
