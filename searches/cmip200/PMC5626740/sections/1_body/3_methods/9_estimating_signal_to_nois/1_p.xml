<p id="Par39" class="p">For the analysis of these Pinatubo sensitivity experiments, we used two approaches to evaluate the statistical significance of anomalies associated with volcanic forcing, relative to purely random, internal coupled ocean–atmosphere variability. The anomalies associated with the response to volcanism are computed as paired differences between each of the members of the Pinatubo experiment and its unforced counterpart. The first statistical calculation estimates the statistical significance of the anomaly between the two ensemble means using a two-tailed Welch’s 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>-test, and taking into account the size and variance of each (control and Pinatubo) ensemble. For CMIP5 model analyses, the significance of anomalies relative to the climatology is measured using a two-tailed Student’s 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>-test, considering each model as an independent degree of freedom. For both our paired Pinatubo ensembles and CMIP5 models, we also estimated at each time step and grid point the percentage for which at least two thirds of the individual simulations have anomalies of consistent sign, which is a commonly used technique for analysing outputs of CMIP models. This allows us to verify that statistically significant anomalies in the ensemble mean are representative of the ensemble members and not due to a few extreme members. Figure captions specify the test for each figure.
