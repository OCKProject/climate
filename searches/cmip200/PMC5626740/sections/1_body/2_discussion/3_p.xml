<p id="Par20" class="p">Our results may allow further reconciling the CMIP5 models response to volcanism with that from the limited observational record. RSST anomalies peak at the end of the eruption year for most of the observed eruptions, as in our experiments with a recharged equatorial Pacific heat content at the time of the eruption (Fig.

 </sup>, only available for the 1991 Pinatubo, 1982 El Chichón and 1963 Agung eruptions, suggest high equatorial Pacific heat content before those eruptions (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">13</xref>), which would tend to favour maximum RSST anomalies at the end of the year. On the other hand, CMIP5 historical simulations sample the full ENSO cycle (mixture of discharged, neutral and recharged states), and hence yield a response that is more representative of neutral initial conditions.
