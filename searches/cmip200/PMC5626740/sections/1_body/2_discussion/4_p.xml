<p id="Par21" class="p">Our results suggest that volcanically induced El Niño-like events involve a more persistent external wind forcing than classical El Niños, whose growth is dominated by internally generated wind anomalies through the Bjerknes feedback. This may explain the atypical timing of the volcanically induced El Niño-like warming in our experiments that peak in boreal summer rather than boreal winter (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Further analyses are however required to understand how the timing of the eruption influences the El Niño-like response

 </sup>. An improved understanding and representation of ENSO response to volcanism in climate models may in particular yield extra ENSO predictability after major eruptions, beyond the traditional 6-month lead time limit.
