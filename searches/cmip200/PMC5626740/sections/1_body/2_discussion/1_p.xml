<p id="Par18" class="p">Previous work has offered no consensus on how ENSO responds to volcanic forcing because the observational record is relatively short and there were inconsistencies between modelling studies

 </sup>. In contrast, our results clearly indicate a tendency for large tropical volcanic eruptions to induce an El Niño-like response peaking during the year after the eruption. Part of the confusion in previous modelling studies arose because they did not properly separate the direct cooling effect of volcanism from that associated with ENSO. Global climate models, for instance, do not overestimate the volcanically induced tropical cooling

 </sup>. Similarly, it is necessary to remove the volcanically induced tropical cooling signal (for instance through the use of relative SST) in order to clearly isolate the ENSO response to volcanism. This is particularly true for the former studies suggestive of a La Niña response
