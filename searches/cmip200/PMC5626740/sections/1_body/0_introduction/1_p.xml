 </sup> between the ocean and atmosphere, whereby a central Pacific warm SST anomaly induces westerly wind anomalies that strengthen the initial SST anomaly. ENSO has two opposite phases with warm events being referred to as El Niño, and cold ones as La Niña. ENSO events occur spontaneously every couple of years, and usually peak at the end of the calendar year with worldwide impacts on climate through the alteration of the global atmospheric circulation
