<p id="Par4" class="p">Because of its global impacts and strong societal relevance, improving the understanding and forecasting of ENSO is a key objective in climate science. The understanding of ENSO intrinsic dynamics has improved over recent decades, in particular with the identification of useful predictors

 </sup>. An unusually high early-year WWV tends to precede an El Niño peaking 1 year later. The understanding of ENSO response to external forcing is however primitive compared to our understanding of its internal dynamics. There is, for instance, neither a clear consensus on how ENSO is influenced by anthropogenic forcing

 </sup> nor, as we will see below, how it is influenced by volcanism. Some explosive tropical volcanic eruptions are sufficiently strong to inject aerosols into the stratosphere. Those aerosols backscatter incoming solar radiation, and reduce the global surface temperature by a few tenths of a degree Celsius for a couple of years
