<p id="Par7" class="p">There is hence a need to reconcile in situ observations and paleo-proxies, which suggest an El Ni単o during the 2 years that follow the eruption, and modelling studies that have reached no consensus on either the sign or the mechanism of the ENSO response to volcanism. Here, we show that using SST anomalies relative to the tropical average (relative SST in the following) allows us to reconcile models and observations. This metric reveals that an El Ni単o event tends to follow large tropical eruptions in observed SST data sets and in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) historical experiments. We further use the Institut Pierre Simon Laplace (IPSL)-CM5B

 </sup> climate model and complementary atmospheric and oceanic ensemble simulations, with and without a Pinatubo-like forcing, to identify the main mechanism at play. We choose the Pinatubo eruption in June 1991, as it is the largest and best-documented tropical stratospheric eruption of the instrumental period. We first show that the response to volcanism superposes linearly with the natural ENSO cycle. We then demonstrate that the cooling of tropical Africa (the largest tropical landmass) reduces precipitation, and forces an atmospheric Kelvin wave response that triggers westerly wind anomalies and an El Ni単o over the Pacific. We also show that, while modulated by the seasonal cycle of convection, the effect of volcanism on wind forcing over the Pacific persists during the second year after the eruption, implying that the Pacific El Ni単o-like response involves more external forcing than traditional, internally generated events.
