<p id="Par14" class="p">The westerly wind anomaly in fall of the eruption year plays an essential role in favouring the development of an El Niño. We have developed targeted ensemble experiments using the atmospheric component of the IPSL-CM5B model forced by the outputs of the coupled model ensemble (see Methods and Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>) to investigate the respective role of the following three processes in its generation. First, we examine the direct effect of volcanic radiative forcing on clouds and atmospheric vapour content
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">36</xref>
 </sup>, potentially altering the atmospheric vertical structure and inducing an atmospheric dynamical response (hereafter referred to as ATM). Volcanic aerosol forcing is included in ATM, but the surface albedo is modified so that continental surfaces do not cool in response to volcanic forcing in this experiment (see Methods, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4e, f</xref>). We also examine the indirect effects of volcanic forcing through the induced horizontal SST gradients
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>
 </sup> (hereafter OCEAN, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4g, h</xref>). The OCEAN experiment includes not only the effect of SST anomalies that develop in response to volcanic forcing
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>
 </sup>, but also the positive Bjerknes feedback between the ocean and atmosphere once El Niño-like SST anomalies have started developing. Continents cool faster than the ocean in response to volcanic forcing, due to their lower heat capacity
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>
 </sup>. The third and last experiment (hereafter referred to as LAND) tests the effect of this differential surface cooling between land and ocean. In LAND, there is no prescribed aerosol forcing as in OCEAN, but the land surface albedo modification enforces a land surface cooling that is consistent with that of the IPSL-CM5B coupled model experiment (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4i, j</xref>). This strategy allows land surface temperature variations in OCEAN experiments, in response to SST anomalies (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4h</xref>), as described in the context of global warming
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref>, 
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">38</xref>
 </sup>. It is hence more physically relevant than experiments that directly constrain land surface temperature
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">19</xref>
 </sup>, which can result in an exaggerated land cooling and land–ocean gradients. A complementary set of sensitivity experiments (see Methods, Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>) explores the effect of the faster land cooling only over specific regions: tropics (LAND-T), extra-tropics (LAND-ET), Africa (LAND-Africa), Southeast Asia (LAND-SEA) and the maritime continent (LAND-MC).
