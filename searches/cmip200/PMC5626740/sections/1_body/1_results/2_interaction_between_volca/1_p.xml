<p id="Par11" class="p">While there are enhanced chances of El Niño events after the five major historic volcanic eruptions in the CMIP5 database, some members still display neutral or La Niña conditions following these eruptions. This can be explained by the interaction between volcanic forcing and the natural ENSO cycle. As mentioned earlier, the equatorial Pacific Ocean heat content (or WWV) is a well-known ENSO precursor

 </sup>. Using the IPSL-CM5B model we ran three pairs of 3-year-long ensemble experiments, starting from anomalously high, nearly neutral and low equatorial Pacific heat content shortly before the Pinatubo eruption (see Methods). Each pair consists of a 30-member ensemble with and without the Pinatubo eruption radiative forcing. Paired anomalies between these two ensembles combine the response to volcanic forcing (signal) and internal climate variability (noise), the latter being reduced by averaging across ensemble members.
