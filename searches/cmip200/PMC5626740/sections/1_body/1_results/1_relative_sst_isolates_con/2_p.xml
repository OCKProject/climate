<p id="Par9" class="p">Using RSST removes the apparent discrepancies among previous modelling studies that have reported responses to volcanism ranging from favouring La Niña to El Niño conditions. For each of the 106 CMIP5

 </sup> historical simulations (see Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>), we identify El Niño events from averaged Niño3.4 region monthly RSST standardized anomalies that exceed 0.5 for three consecutive months. This analysis indicates that the number of CMIP5 simulations displaying an El Niño response increases by 30–60% relative to the climatological El Niño probability within 2 years that follows the 5 major volcanic events of the historical period (Fig.

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3a</xref>). The low probability (
