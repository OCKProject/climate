 </sup> after large eruptions. Here we isolate the intrinsic ENSO signal from the volcanically-induced surface cooling by using relative SST (designated RSST) anomalies rather than raw SST anomalies. RSST, which was initially proposed to better explain the response of tropical cyclones to climate fluctuations

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">30</xref>
 </sup>, is defined as the residual signal obtained after removing the mean tropical (20 °N–20 °S) SST anomalies. In observations, RSST (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a, b</xref>) reveals an equatorial Pacific warming after the five largest tropical volcanic eruptions of the historical period. The resulting RSST composite anomaly in the Niño3.4 region (a common ENSO indicator) reaches 1.1 °C during early boreal winter following the eruptions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref>). The probability of having such an average anomaly for 5 randomly picked years is 0.3% according to bootstrap statistics (see Methods and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>). Such low probability is suggestive of a tendency for tropical explosive volcanism to trigger an El Niño event
