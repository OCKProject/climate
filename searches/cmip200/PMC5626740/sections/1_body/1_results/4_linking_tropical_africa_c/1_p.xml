 <italic class="italic">yellow curve</italic>), indicating that in isolation from the surface cooling, the direct effect of the radiative forcing on the atmosphere cannot explain the volcanically induced western Pacific initial westerly wind anomaly (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4e, f</xref>) and the subsequent El Niño. The initial westerly wind anomaly after the eruption is instead largely driven by land–sea temperature contrasts, accounted for in the LAND experiment (
 <italic class="italic">light blue curve</italic> in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5a</xref>). These land–sea temperature contrasts induce a strong cooling over tropical continental surfaces (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4j</xref>) in late summer and early fall after the eruption, which results in reduced convective activity and drying of tropical America, Africa and the maritime continent (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4i</xref>). The experiment (see Methods, Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>) including only cooling over tropical Africa indicates that it contributes to more than 80% of the initial westerly wind anomaly (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5a</xref>, 
 <italic class="italic">green curve</italic>). Rather than the maritime continent, Southeast Asia or the extra-tropics, it is hence the cooling over the largest tropical landmass, namely Africa, that has the strongest effect on Pacific winds (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5c</xref>). Indeed, the land surface cooling is maximum in the tropics during the first boreal summer and fall (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4j</xref>) and leads to a reduction of the West African monsoon (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6a, b</xref>). The reduced precipitation and tropospheric heating in the equatorial latitudes drive a Matsuno–Gill response

 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref> and Supplementary Fig.
