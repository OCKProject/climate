<p id="Par17" class="p">This western Pacific westerly wind anomaly initiates oceanic downwelling Kelvin waves that warm the central Pacific in winter of the eruption year (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7b</xref>), creating favourable conditions for El Niño development. While the westerly wind and positive RSST anomalies in the Pacific are initially driven by the continental—mostly African—cooling (

 <italic class="italic">green curves</italic> in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5a, b</xref>), the Bjerknes feedback (
 <italic class="italic">deep blue curves</italic> in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5a, b</xref>) strengthens those anomalies during the year after the eruption (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7c</xref>). The Pacific westerly anomalies driven by cooling over the continents weaken during boreal winter of the year following the eruption (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5a, c</xref>), probably because convection moves away from the equator during boreal winter (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6d–f</xref>). During the following year, the cooling of tropical land masses also induces a boreal fall westerly wind anomaly over the tropical Pacific again. This westerly wind anomaly is generated by similar mechanisms to those during the previous year (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6g–i</xref>), although the tropical African cooling and drying play a lesser role, as the tropical volcanic radiative cooling has significantly decreased by this time (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>a, c and 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7c</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">12</xref>). This volcanically forced westerly wind anomaly also contributes to the second-year Niño-like warming during summer and fall (
 <italic class="italic">dark</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">light blue curve</italic>s, Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>a, b and 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7d</xref>). Overall, this suggests a stronger role of externally forced westerly wind anomalies for volcanically induced El Niño-like events than for internally generated El Niños, for which the Bjerknes positive feedback is responsible for most of the anomalous conditions.
