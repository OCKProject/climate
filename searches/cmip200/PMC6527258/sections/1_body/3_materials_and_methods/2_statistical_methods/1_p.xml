<p class="p">To diagnose the impact of spring snow cover on the Indian summer monsoon rainfall, we performed a correlation analysis between AISMR (June to September) and satellite-based Eurasian spring (March to May) SCF for each grid square. We also computed the partial correlation between spring SCF and AISMR while controlling for the effects of ENSO, NAO, and IOD. In addition, we performed a linear regression analysis to reveal the response of the air temperature and atmospheric circulation to the snow anomalies. All variables were detrended before the statistical analyses. The significance of all the analysis was determined by the standard two-tailed Studentâ€™s
