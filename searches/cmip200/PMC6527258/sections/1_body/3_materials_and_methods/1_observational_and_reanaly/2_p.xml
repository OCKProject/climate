<p class="p">The snow cover data were from the Northern Hemisphere EASE-Grid 2.0 weekly snow cover and sea ice extent version 4, available at the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC). The data were stored as binary files in arrays of 720 columns by 720 rows and had a spatial resolution of 25 km. To make the comparison with other data easier, we converted the EASE-Grid 2.0 data to a 1° × 1° longitude-latitude grid. The snow cover data were in binary form (snow or no snow), and so we used the SCF, rather than snow cover extent, to represent the variability of snow cover. The monthly SCF was calculated by summing the number of weeks in that month for which snow was present for a pixel and by expressing this number as a fraction of the total number of weeks in that month (

First, the snow cover has little interannual variability during the winter. Second, the snow-albedo effect was found to be high in the spring because of the rapid retreat of snow cover. In addition, the snow-hydrological effect, controlled by anomalies in snow water equivalent, emerges in spring, meaning that the degree to which the atmosphere responds to changes in snow should be strong at this time of year (
