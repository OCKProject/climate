<p class="p">The data of 500 hPa air temperature and wind fields with a resolution of 2.5° × 2.5° for the summer months (June to September) were obtained from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP)–National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) reanalysis (

 <xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">54</italic>
 </xref>). The soil moisture data were provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Climate Prediction Center (CPC) and had a resolution of 0.5° × 0.5°. In addition, we used the 3-month mean (June, July, and August) Oceanic Niño Index in the Niño 3.4 region to represent the ENSO, and the average monthly NAO index for January, February, and March to represent the cold season NAO index. Both the ENSO index and the NAO index are also available at the NOAA CPC. We used summer (June to September) Dipole Mode Index (DMI) from the NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory to represent the IOD. The IOD was considered since it exerts an important impact on both the Indian summer monsoon rainfall (
