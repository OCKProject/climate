<p class="p">As illustrated in 
 <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>, in the period 1991–2015, mean spring SCF over central Eurasia decreased by 16% (
 <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 4A</xref>), and the snowmelt date advanced by at least 2 weeks (
 <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 4B</xref>) in comparison to those in the period 1967–1990. Such a decline in spring snow cover and an advance in snowmelt date could lead to less infiltration of meltwater into the soils, resulting in the soil moisture anomalies becoming more susceptible to rainfall and evaporation during summer and hence losing the memory. To test this mechanism, we calculated the memory of spring (March to May) soil moisture anomalies over central Eurasia as the number of months until the correlation coefficient of soil moisture between spring and the following months dropped below the insignificant level (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &gt; 0.05). Our analysis showed that the memory length reduced from 4 months (June to September) in the earlier period to 2 months (June and July) in the later period (
 <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 4C</xref>). As a result of the decline in soil moisture memory since 1990, the anomaly of CESCF can only efficiently affect the atmospheric circulations and air temperature over Asian landmass during June and July rather than during the whole monsoon season (June to September) (fig. S7). Therefore, the reduced snow-hydrological effect can be regarded as a plausible mechanism for the observed decoupled relationship between snow and air temperature in the later period.
