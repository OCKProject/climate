<p class="p">The potential mechanism responsible for the shift in snow-related circulations and the resultant snow-air temperature decoupling could be related to the change in the lagged snow-hydrological effect. Numerous observational and modeling studies indicated that the snow-hydrological effect has as a crucial role in determining the land-atmosphere coupling through its effects on the soil moisture (
