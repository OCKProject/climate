<p class="p">Changes in Eurasian spring snow cover and the resultant alterations of land surface conditions could exert strong impacts on the hemispheric atmospheric circulation and hence the climate during the following seasons (

 </xref>). Therefore, we explored whether the observed shift in the snow-air temperature relationship is explained by changes in the snow-related summer atmospheric circulation. We performed regression analyses of summer wind field at 500 hPa with respect to the CESCF. Our analyses illustrated that there is a prominent anomalous cyclonic circulation centered over the IPS following the excessive anomaly of CESCF during the earlier period (

Such an anomalous cyclonic circulation, on the one hand, acts to transport cold air from midlatitudes into the IPS via the anomalous northeasterly winds. On the other hand, the cyclonic flow could probably further lower the mid-tropospheric air temperature by favoring upward air motion that leads to an increase in cloud cover and a reduction of downward solar radiation (

 </xref>). The cooling in the mid-upper troposphere over the IPS would contribute to a decrease of the meridional thermal gradient and thereby a depressed Indian summer monsoon. In the later period, however, there are almost no significant anomalies of circulations in response to the variability of CESCF (
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 3B</xref>). Particularly, the cyclonic circulation over the IPS formed in the earlier period has vanished but was replaced by an anomalous weak southerly wind, which is conducive to the advection of warm air from lower latitudes to the IPS and may thus destroy the inverse snow-air temperature correlation (
