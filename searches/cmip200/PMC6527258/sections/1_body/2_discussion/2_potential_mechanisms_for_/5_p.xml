<p class="p">In summary, we have used the long-term satellite-based snow cover data and instrumental rainfall records (1967–2015) to show that the classical inverse relationship between Eurasian spring snow cover and subsequent Indian summer monsoon rainfall has disappeared after 1990. This shift in the snow-monsoon relationship is found to be related to the reduced lagged snow-hydrological effect, which could be further attributed to the reduction of spring snow cover and an advance in snowmelt date due to the climate warming. However, our understanding of the mechanisms behind the loss of the snow-monsoon correlation is still limited. Further studies using the state-of-the-art earth system models, which include a physical representation of the interactions between snow and atmospheric dynamics, are required to develop our comprehension of these mechanisms. In addition, similar behavior to the observed weakening of the snow-monsoon correlation is found in the relationship between the Indian summer monsoon and ENSO, suggesting a changing paradigm for Indian summer monsoon precipitation in a warming atmosphere. The CMIP5 models fail to capture the connection between snow cover and the monsoon and its shift at the decadal time scale, emphasizing the necessity to improve the models’ ability to represent snow status and atmospheric responses to snow anomalies in a warming world.</p>
