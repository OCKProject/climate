<p class="p">In addition, we note that the atmospheric circulation pattern associated with the anomaly of CESCF during 1991â€“2015 (

 </xref>). It therefore tentatively suggests that the emergence of the west-east dipole pattern may lead to changes in the CESCF-related atmospheric circulations, which, in turn, contribute to the decoupling between CESCF and air temperature over the IPS in the later period. However, uncertainties remain in understanding the linkage between snow and circulation anomalies based on statistical analysis. We could not rule out the possible interference of internal atmospheric dynamics and other boundary conditions, such as sea surface temperature over the North Atlantic, with the influence of snow (

  <italic class="italic">32</italic>
 </xref>). Further model simulation works are needed to quantify the actual role of the west-east dipole pattern of snow cover in shaping the circulation.
