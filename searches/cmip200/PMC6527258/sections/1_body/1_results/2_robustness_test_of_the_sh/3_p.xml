<p class="p">Third, the change in the snow-monsoon relationship was also found when the Climate Research Unit (CRU) precipitation dataset was adopted to represent the Indian summer monsoon rainfall intensity (
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 2, C and D</xref>). To obtain further insight into the shift in the snow-monsoon relationship, we performed linear regression analyses to determine how the spatial pattern of Indian summer monsoon rainfall anomalies covaries with CESCF for the two periods. These analyses show that positive anomalies of spring snow cover over central Eurasia precede a significant decline in summer rainfall especially over northwestern and central India (also known as the core Indian monsoon region) during the period 1967â€“1990 (
