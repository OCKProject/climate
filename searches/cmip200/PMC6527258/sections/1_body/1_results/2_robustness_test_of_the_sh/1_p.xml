 <sub class="sub">CESCF-AISMR</sub> between the periods 1967–1990 and 1991–2015, we performed the following tests. First, we randomly selected 20 years for each period (1967–1990 and 1991–2015) and found that

 <sub class="sub">CESCF-AISMR</sub> shifted from −0.61 ± 0.07 (with 98.6% of values being statistically significant and negative during 1967–1990) to 0.18 ± 0.11 (with 99.4% of values being statistically nonsignificant during 1991–2015) (
