<p class="p">Second, we tested whether the observed shift in the snow-monsoon relationship is due to the weakened ENSO-monsoon association. This is an important test, given that previous studies have indicated that ENSO could affect both the Indian summer monsoon and Eurasian snow cover through atmospheric teleconnections (

 </xref>). To make the test, we calculated a partial correlation between CESCF and AISMR after statistically controlling for the ENSO effect for the two periods.

 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 2B</xref> and fig. S2, C to F). These analyses illustrate that the shift in the snow-monsoon relationship is not an artifact but a real phenomenon.
