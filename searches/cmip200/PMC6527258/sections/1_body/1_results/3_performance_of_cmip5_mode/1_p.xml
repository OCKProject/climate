<p class="p">Do current climate models capture such a shift in the snow-monsoon connection? To answer this question, we examine the simulation outputs of 30 models participating in the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) (table S1). We show that the key region with the strongest impact of spring snow cover on the Indian summer monsoon rainfall varies among models (fig. S3). In terms of the multimodel mean, the strongest impact lies in central Russia rather than central Eurasia (fig. S3). These differences across models and the differences between the model outputs and observations could arise from a combination of several factors and should be interpreted with caution. The CMIP5 climate models have systematic biases in their simulation of snow states (

 <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">39</italic>
 </xref>). Such biases could propagate through the models and lead to errors in the modelsâ€™ atmospheric responses to the underlying snow patterns (

  <italic class="italic">4</italic>
 </xref>), thus contributing to the model-data mismatch. Although the key region with the strongest impact of snow on the monsoon was not captured, around 8 of 30 models and the multimodel mean could reproduce the shift in the snow-monsoon relationship (fig. S4), if their own region where spring SCF strongly affected the Indian summer monsoon was used.
