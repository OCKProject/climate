<p class="p">We found that changes in spring snow cover fraction (SCF; March to May) over central Eurasia (40 to 80°E, 35 to 65°N; the red box in 
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 1A</xref>), including eastern Europe, western Siberia, central Asia, and the western Himalaya, had the strongest negative impact on the subsequent all-Indian summer monsoon rainfall (AISMR; June to September) for the entire study period. This result is consistent with previous findings, although the time periods considered are different (

 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 1A</xref>). However, the spring SCF over this region exhibits smaller interannual variability in comparison with that in central Eurasia (fig. S1), meaning that its importance in the seasonal forecast of the AISMR changes should be limited.
