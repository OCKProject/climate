<p class="p">Next, we focus on the central Eurasian region only and examine the stability of the interannual relationship between central Eurasian spring SCF and the subsequent AISMR for the period 1967–2015. For this analysis, the area-weighted average spring SCF over central Eurasia (hereafter CESCF) was calculated as an index of spring snow cover variabilities. Both CESCF and AISMR have a prominent interannual variability (
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 1D</xref>). Correlation analysis between CESCF and AISMR, using a 15-year sliding window, indicated that the relationship between the two variables underwent a dramatic shift starting around 1990 (see inset in 
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 1D</xref>). Consequently, we split the study period into two subperiods (1967–1990 and 1991–2015) for further inspection. We found that

 <sub class="sub">CESCF-AISMR</sub> (both time series are detrended; see Materials and Methods) is significantly negative during the period 1967–1990 (
 <italic class="italic">R</italic> = −0.61,

 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.39) (
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 1D</xref>). This phenomenon was also reflected in the correlation patterns, where spring SCF over central Eurasia displays a coherent strong negative correlation with AISMR before 1990 but shows no significant correlation thereafter (
