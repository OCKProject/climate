<p class="p">The extent of spring Eurasian snow cover has been shrinking in recent years, as a consequence of rapid climate warming at mid to high latitudes (

 </xref>). It would seem reasonable to suppose that this large-scale spring snow retreat should lead to higher land temperature and an increased land-sea thermal contrast that would be expected to strengthen the Indian summer monsoon. However, the Indian summer monsoon rainfall has experienced a clear downward trend in the last several decades (

 </xref>), suggesting that our comprehension of the snow-monsoon relationship in a changing climate is incomplete. Previous studies have documented that the snow-monsoon relationship shows secular changes (

 </xref>), but the mechanisms through which the altered snow cover affects the snow-monsoon relationship have not been identified. Here, we aim to unravel the causes of an evolving relationship between the Eurasian spring snow cover and the subsequent Indian summer monsoon rainfall at the interannual time scale by synthesizing long-term satellite snow cover data, instrumental rainfall records, and reanalysis datasets.
