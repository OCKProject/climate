  <p class="p">(
   <bold class="bold">A</bold> and 
   <bold class="bold">B</bold>) Linear regression of summer (June to September) air temperature (AT) (°C) and wind fields (m/s) at 500 hPa with respect to CESCF for 1967–1990 and 1991–2015, respectively. (
   <bold class="bold">C</bold> and 
   <bold class="bold">D</bold>) Linear regression of air temperature with respect to AISMR for 1967–1990 and 1991–2015, respectively. The pink dashed lines represent significant air temperature anomalies at the 95% confidence level, and black arrows denote that the wind anomalies are statistically significant (
   <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) based on a Student’s 
   <italic class="italic">t</italic> test. (
   <bold class="bold">E</bold> to 
   <bold class="bold">G</bold>) Correlation coefficients of CESCF with air temperature averaged over the IPS, that of CESCF with AISMR, and that of AISMR with air temperature over the IPS, respectively. The IPS is denoted by the red box in (A). The asterisks indicate that the correlation coefficients are statistically significant (
   <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05). All the temperature and wind data are derived from the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis.
