All statistics are based on the average results from three land surface model (i.e., CLM4.5, VIC, NoahMP) simulations driven by observed meteorological forcings during 1961â€“2005. Maps were created by using the NCAR Command Language (Version 6.3.0) [Software]. (2016). Boulder, Colorado: UCAR/NCAR/CISL/TDD. 10.5065/D6WD3XH5.
