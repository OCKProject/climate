The population scenarios for Shared Socioeconomic Pathways with medium challenges to mitigation and adaptation (SSP2) provided by National Climate Center at China Meteorological Administration was used for future projection. Regions with risk values &lt;0.1 million days*persons per year were masked. Stippling denotes the regions where over 80% of the models agree on the sign of changes. All the statistics were calculated during the growing seasons (April–September). Maps were created by using the NCAR Command Language (Version 6.3.0) [Software]. (2016). Boulder, Colorado: UCAR/NCAR/CISL/TDD. 10.5065/D6WD3XH5. And the maps were updated with a database provided by
