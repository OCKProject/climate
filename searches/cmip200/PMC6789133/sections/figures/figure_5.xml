  <p class="p">Future changes in flash drought risk averaged over China under different warming and socioeconomic scenarios. The risk changes under (
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>) RCP4.5 and (
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>) RCP8.5 (% relative to the 1970–1999 present-day level) scenarios based on 29 realizations with different combination of CMIP5 climate models and land surface models (see Supplementary Table 
   <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref> for details). Population under SSPs 1–5 from CMA-NCC and CUNY-NCAR were used to estimate exposure risk, where the former considered the recent two-child policy in China. All the statistics were calculated during the growing seasons (April–September). The black bars show 5–95% uncertainties which were estimated by using bootstrapping for 10000 times
