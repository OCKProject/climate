  <p class="p">Attribution for historical change in flash drought frequency. 
   <bold class="bold">a</bold> Observed and simulated anomalies of the number of flash drought events per year averaged over China. Black line shows the ensemble mean of OBS/CLM4.5, OBS/VIC, and OBS/NoahMP simulations, red, blue, and cyan lines show the land surface model ensemble simulations driven by CMIP5 climate model ensemble simulations with ALL, NAT, and GHG forcings, respectively (see Supplementary Table 
   <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref> for details). The thick lines are 10 years running means, and the pink, cyan, and yellow shadings display the 5–95% ranges of ALL, NAT, and GHG ensemble simulations respectively. 
   <bold class="bold">b</bold> The best estimates of the scaling factors (left axis) and attributable increasing trends (right axis) from three-signal (GHG, OANT = ALL-GHG-NAT and NAT) analyses of flash drought changes for the period 1961–2005. Error bars indicate their corresponding 5–95% uncertainty ranges estimated via Monte Carlo simulations. All the statistics were calculated during the growing seasons (April–September)
