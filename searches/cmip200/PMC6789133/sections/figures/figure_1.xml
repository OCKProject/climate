  <p class="p">Illustration of the definition of a flash drought event. The black solid line shows 5 days mean soil moisture percentile (SM) for a grid point (112.75°E, 25.25°N) during the 2013 southern China flash drought. The dates in the horizontal axis are in the middle of the 5 days periods. The blue asterisks and red circles show flash droughts identified by concurrent heat and drought conditions (old; i.e., pentad mean surface air temperature anomaly larger than its standard deviation, and soil moisture percentile lower than 30%) and by the new definition used in this study (new; the pentad mean soil moisture decreases from above 40th percentile to 20th percentile, with an average decline rate of no less than 5% in percentile for each pentad; if the declined soil moisture rises up to 20th percentile again, the drought terminates; and the drought should last for at least three pentads), respectively</p>
