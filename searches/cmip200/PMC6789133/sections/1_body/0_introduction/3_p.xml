 </sup>, flash drought events are also subject to the processes of onset and recovery. Flash droughts could either evolve into seasonal droughts (e.g., the 2012 central USA summer drought), or terminate independently without connection with droughts at longer time scales. However, existing definitions do not explicitly consider drought intensification processes, or have neglected the recovery stage as well as the severity of a flash drought event

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">20</xref>
 </sup>. A popular definition for flash drought events in the hydro-climate community is based on the joint distribution of positive temperature anomaly (e.g., heatwave) and soil moisture deficit

 </sup>, although the eco-hydrological community has different opinions from the perspective of flash drought impact
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>
 </sup>. The former essentially defines an event with concurrent heat extreme and dry conditions, but not necessarily a drought event. For a drought event (no matter conventional drought or flash drought), the system should reach a water deficit for a period of time. If a dry anomaly lasts for a very short period (which is common in the previous definitions

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">20</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>
 </sup>), it may not have any significant impacts on the ecosystem or the society. Moreover, the rapid intensification is also a key feature to distinguish flash droughts from conventional droughts in terms of their physical characteristics and impacts, and the identification of the severity and different drought stages facilitates early warning and risk assessment during the evolvement of flash droughts.
