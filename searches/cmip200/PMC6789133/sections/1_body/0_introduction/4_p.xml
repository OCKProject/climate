<p id="Par6" class="p">Here, we propose a new flash drought definition based on soil moisture that can capture both flash (rapid intensification of a drought condition, e.g., rapid decline in soil moisture) and drought (under a certain soil moisture threshold for a period of time) conditions. Based on the new definition, we attribute historical change of flash droughts regarding human fingerprint, and project future exposure risk of flash droughts over China by carrying out land surface model (LSM) ensemble simulations driven by multiple climate model simulations from the fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). We find a significant increase in flash drought risk over China during the middle and end of this century, especially over southern China, where both human and ecosystems have high exposure and poor adaptability. The increasing flash drought risk is mainly caused by greenhouse gas-induced anthropogenic climate change, where both long-term warming and increasing rainfall variability lead to a drier but more variable soil condition over the flash drought hotspots. Moreover, population increase is another important factor for the increase of exposure risk. Our results suggest that non-traditional drought regions should also receive attention for drought adaptation, given the increasing risk of flash droughts in a changing climate.</p>
