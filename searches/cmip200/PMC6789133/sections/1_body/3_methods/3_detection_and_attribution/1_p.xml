 </sup> to analyze the anthropogenic climate change influence. The method regresses the observed changes (
 <italic class="italic">y</italic>) against the forced multimodel signal patterns (
 <italic class="italic">X</italic>) as: 
 <italic class="italic">Y</italic> = 
 <italic class="italic">βX</italic> + 
 <italic class="italic">ε</italic>. In this study, three-signal analysis was conducted, where 
 <italic class="italic">X</italic> was expressed as GHG, OANT (ALL-GHG-NAT), and NAT forcings on non-overlapping 3-year averages of flash drought frequency. The scaling factors (
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>) represent the model simulated response patterns to match observations, which were estimated by the total least-squares method. 
 <italic class="italic">ε</italic> is the residual or the internal variability, and it was estimated using the CTL ensembles with 36 trunks from nine models (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>). The uncertainties in the scaling factors give a measure of whether a particular external forcing is detected. If the 90% confidence interval of 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic> is above zero, the corresponding signal factor is claimed to be detected at a significance level of 5%. If the uncertainty range of 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic> also includes one, the attribution supports that the observed changes are consistent with the external forcings.
