In fact, 13 CMIP5/ALL/LSM simulations were carried out, and 11 CMIP5 models were selected due to their capability in reproducing the upward trend for flash drought frequency over China for CLM4.5 and VIC, while seven CMIP5 models were selected for NoahMP (see Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref> for details). Daily precipitation and surface air temperature future projection data from the above 11 CMIP5 models were used to drive LSMs to provide daily soil moisture for projecting future flash drought changes. Both the simulations under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios were used.
