 </sup> was aggregated into 0.5° over China. The original CUNY-NCAR population data was available every 10 years, and they were linearly interpolated into annual data. To better capture future population changes in China, a new annual dataset based on the 6th national census in 2010, as well as the newly released two-child policy in China (CMA-NCC)
