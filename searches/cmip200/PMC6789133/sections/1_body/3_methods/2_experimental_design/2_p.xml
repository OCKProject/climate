 </sup> was used by adjusting the cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) from CMIP5/ALL simulations of precipitation and temperature to the observed CDFs during 1959–2005. GHG, NAT, and CTL simulations were also corrected based on the same CDFs from ALL simulations during 1959–2005. For the future projection experiments, the CMIP5/RCP4.5 and CMIP5/RCP8.5 outputs were corrected based on the equidistant CDF matching method

 </sup> by accounting for distribution changes in historical (1959–2005) and projection (2006–2099) conditions. These bias corrections were conducted at monthly time scale, and the corrected monthly precipitation and temperature was applied to adjust daily CMIP5 outputs before being used to drive the LSMs for flash drought simulations. Supplementary Figs. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>–
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref> show that the bias correction method performed well during historical period and preserved the trends for future projections. Although all bias corrections use 1959–2005 as the baseline period for constructing historical distributions and correcting future projections, the soil moisture percentile estimations use 1961–2005 as the baseline period for both historical (1961–2005) attribution and future (2006–2099) projection of flash droughts, because the soil moisture data during 1959–1960 are dropped as LSM spin-up results.
