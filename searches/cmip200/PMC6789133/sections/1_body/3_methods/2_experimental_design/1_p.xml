<p id="Par23" class="p">To estimate daily soil moisture as well as variation of flash droughts, the LSM simulations under different climate scenarios were performed. First, CRUNCEPv7 data during 1901–1958 was used to drive LSMs to provide an initial land surface condition for subsequent runs. Second, CMA precipitation and temperature observations during 1959–2005 were used to replace those in CRUNCEPv7 data, and the merged data was used for LSM simulations for two cycles from 1959 to 2005, with the land surface conditions at the end of the first cycle being used for the initial conditions for the simulations in the second cycle. The results during 1961–2005 (dropping the 1959–1960 results for spin-up) in the second cycle were regarded as OBS/LSM simulations for the analysis in this paper. Third, CMIP5/LSM two-cycle runs similar to the OBS/LSM were carried out, by replacing CRUNCEPv7 precipitation and temperature during 1959–2005 with CMIP5 simulation data, and the corresponding 1961–2005 results in the second cycle were regarded as CMIP5/ALL/LSM, CMIP5/GHG/LSM, CMIP5/NAT/LSM simulations. The CMIP5/CTL/LSM experiments were conducted similarly, by repeatedly using CRUNCEPv7 data (except for precipitation and temperature) for the four sets of 45 years chunks for each CMIP5/CTL model simulations. These CMIP5/LSM historical simulations provided baseline information for the estimation of flash drought change, and were used for the detection and attribution analysis. Finally, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 results from CMIP5 simulations were used to drive LSMs for future projections during 2006–2099, with initial conditions produced by CMIP5/ALL/LSM simulations at the end of 2005.</p>
