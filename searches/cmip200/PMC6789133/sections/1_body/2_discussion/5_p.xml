<p id="Par19" class="p">In addition, the rapid onset of flash droughts poses a great challenge for early warning. The reason that the 2012 central USA drought was so pernicious was because it started with a flash drought with a rapid onset and intensification which reduced time for preparation, and the flash drought was followed by a seasonal drought that lasted for 8 weeks. In this regard, the flash drought occurred at the onset stage of a seasonal drought

 </sup>. Improving understanding of sub-seasonal predictability with consideration of vegetation–drought interactions and human interventions (e.g., agricultural practices), and developing climate–hydrology–human coupled prediction systems that utilize multiscale memory from the earth system (e.g., oceanic and land processes, or even human activities) would fundamentally increase our capability in managing risk of flash droughts, as well as those connected with seasonal droughts for both the society and environment.
