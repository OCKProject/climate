<p id="Par18" class="p">Flash droughts also have important implications for the ecosystem. Although a moderate drought may not necessarily hinder vegetation growth because there are less clouds and more solar radiation, flash droughts can cause serious damage to the ecosystems if they occur during critical stages of vegetation growth

 </sup>. Quantifying ecological impact of flash droughts is quite difficult because they are usually concurrent with heatwaves, and drought and heat extremes may have a synergistic adverse effect on the ecosystem. The flash droughts defined in this study do not explicitly consider heatwave conditions, but the heat and drought conditions may occur simultaneously for extreme cases, where a bivariate or multivariate (e.g., copula) analysis is needed for investigating their separate contributions and synergistic effect.
