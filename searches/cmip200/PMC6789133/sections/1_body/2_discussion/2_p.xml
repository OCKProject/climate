 </sup>, but this is not due to the definition of flash droughts because our previous studies based on the definition of concurrent heat and dry anomalies also suggests upward trends in China

 </sup>. While rigorous analysis based on comprehensive detection and attribution simulations should be carried out over USA to understand the difference, our preliminary speculation is that the difference may come from two sources: the focus periods and the internal climate variability are different between the studies over USA and China, which would influence the trend analysis; and the hotspots of flash droughts over USA (central Great Plains) experienced an increased soil moisture

 </sup>, while those over China (southern China) experienced significantly decreased soil moisture
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">20</xref>
 </sup>, again during different study periods. The different long-term trends in soil moisture may play an important role in altering flash drought trends, but the variability of hydroclimate variables (e.g., precipitation, temperature, and ET) at short time scales should also be investigated in detail.
