<p id="Par15" class="p">The results of this study have implications for understanding human influence on short-term hydrological extremes (e.g., flash drought), and how we quantify the impacts of future changes in both climate and socioeconomic development on the risk of extreme events. The impact of global warming on soil moisture drought

 </sup> depends on whether the rising temperature causes ET to increase or decrease, which is uncertain because drought conditions usually inhibit ET especially in arid and semiarid regions. For flash drought, the rapid soil moisture decline should be a result of the intensification of ET driven by higher temperature, which is very common in humid and semi-humid regions where soil moisture can sustain high ET amount up to a few weeks. Our projection results suggest that GHG warming will increase growing seasonal mean ET and decrease soil moisture (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">10a, b, e–h</xref>), and therefore will increase flash droughts over southern China, although the growing seasonal mean precipitation will also increase (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">10c, d</xref>). Moreover, significant increase in short-term (i.e., 5-day mean) precipitation variability during growing seasons (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">11c, d</xref>) also contributes to the increase in the variability of ET and soil moisture (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">11e–h</xref>), raising a higher chance for short-term hydrological extremes including flash droughts over China.
