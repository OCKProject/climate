<p id="Par17" class="p">Limiting the warming level as proposed by the Paris Agreement would have a nontrivial impact on reducing the risk of flash drought, but how to reduce the population exposure to flash droughts and how to develop adaptation and mitigation strategies are key to managing flash drought risk. As flash drought occurs more frequently especially in humid and semi-humid regions with a high population exposure, its risk will increase substantially in a warming climate with an accelerated urbanization and population growth, such as eastern China.</p>
