 </sup>, but at a higher temporal resolution. During a study period, the frequency is defined as the average number of flash drought events during the growing seasons per year, the mean duration is the average number of days during which an event lasts, and the mean severity is the mean accumulated soil moisture percentile deficits from the threshold of 40%. There is a higher chance for flash droughts over southern China (humid region) than over northern China (semiarid region), according to both the new and old definitions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a, b</xref>). There are more flash drought events based on the old definition (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b</xref>), but their corresponding mean durations are very short, mostly around 7 days (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2d</xref>). In contrast, the mean durations of flash drought events based on the new definition are about 20–40 days (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2c</xref>), which is more reasonable in terms of drought impact
