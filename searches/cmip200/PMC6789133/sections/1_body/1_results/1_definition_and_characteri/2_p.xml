<p id="Par8" class="p">For the case illustrated in Fig.

 </sup> (blue asterisks in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>), the new definition reflects both the flash (decline rate of soil moisture percentile larger than 5%) and drought (soil moisture percentile &lt;20%) conditions, while the previous definition may overestimate flash drought frequency with too short durations (usually only 5 days, e.g., June 20–24 in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>) that does not lead to any impact. Moreover, the severity of flash drought can also be explicitly estimated with the new definition, using the soil moisture percentile deficit during the flash drought event (red shaded area in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>).
