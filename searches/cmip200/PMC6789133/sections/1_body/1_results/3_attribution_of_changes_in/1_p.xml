<p id="Par13" class="p">To attribute flash drought changes, LSM simulations driven by CMIP5 climate simulations with different forcings were carried out (see the “Methods” section for details). There was an upward trend (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) for the frequency of flash drought events over China during 1961–2005, which was well captured by the CMIP5/ALL/LSM ensemble simulation (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.01) with both anthropogenic and natural forcings considered (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4a</xref>). However, the upward trend could not be reproduced by natural only forcings, where the ensemble simulation from CMIP5/NAT/LSM showed no trend. This suggests that anthropogenic climate change is mainly responsible for the increasing flash drought events over China. The upward trend from CMIP5/GHG/LSM (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.01) is similar to the all forcings simulation, indicating the dominant role of greenhouse gases in all anthropogenic forcings (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4a</xref>). The best estimates of scaling factors show that only the GHG signal is detectable, with a contribution of 77 ± 26% to the increase (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4b</xref>). These results are also consistent with the simulations of flash drought frequency, where GHGs play a dominant role in all anthropogenic forcings (Supplementary Fig.
