<p id="Par14" class="p">Besides the influence of GHGs emissions, the change of population is also an important factor for estimating the change of exposure risk of flash drought. Although the frequency and duration of flash drought increase in the future, the exposure risk over China may decrease significantly at the end of this century (blue bars in Fig.

 </sup> suggests that China’s future population might be underestimated, especially at the end of this century (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">9</xref>). Based on the new population data, significant increase in the flash drought exposure risk over China is projected by the middle of this century (pink bars in Fig.

 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5a</xref>). A higher warming scenario (RCP8.5) will further increase the risk by 9–11% according to the new CMA-NCC population data (Fig.
