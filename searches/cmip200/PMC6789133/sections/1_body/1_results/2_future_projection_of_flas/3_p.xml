<p id="Par12" class="p">The flash drought exposure risk (days*persons) is estimated by multiplying annual population with annual duration of flash drought each year. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3c, d</xref> show that future exposure to flash drought will increase by 23 ± 11% and 19 ± 16% averaged over China in the middle and end of this century. The hot spots for the increasing frequency and duration are located over Yangtze River basin (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">6</xref>), while the largest increases in flash drought risk (more than 40%) occur in the southernmost provinces (e.g., Guizhou, Guangxi, Guangdong; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3c, d</xref>), which suggests that climate change and population growth are the main reasons for the increasing flash drought risk over the north and south parts of southern China, respectively. For northern and northeastern China, future exposure risk of flash drought will decrease due to reductions in flash droughts and population, especially for the end of this century (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3c, d</xref>).
