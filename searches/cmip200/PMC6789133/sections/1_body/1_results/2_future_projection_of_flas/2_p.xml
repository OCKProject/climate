<p id="Par11" class="p">Compared to the baseline period, the severity of flash drought is projected to increase significantly over southern China and part of northeastern China, and decrease slightly over part of northern China under the business as usual scenario (i.e., Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 (RCP4.5)) during both the middle and the end of this century (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a, b</xref>). On average, China flash drought severity will increase by 18 ± 9% and 22 ± 12% during 2040–2069 and 2070–2099, respectively, with increases larger than 20% over most parts of southern China. The spatial patterns of the changes in frequency and duration are similar to the severity, where southern China will experience more frequent flash droughts with longer durations (Supplementary Fig.
