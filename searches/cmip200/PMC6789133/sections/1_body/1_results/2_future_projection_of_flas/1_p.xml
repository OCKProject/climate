<p id="Par10" class="p">To project future changes of flash drought risk, LSM ensemble simulations driven by historical and future meteorological conditions from CMIP5 climate models were performed, and the simulated soil moisture was used to calculate flash drought characteristics based on our new definition. The climate data from CMIP5 models were bias corrected (Supplementary Figs. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>–
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref>; see the “Methods” section for details) before feeding into the LSMs, and the LSMs included the Community Land Model version 4.5 (CLM4.5)

 </sup>. There are considerable uncertainties both from CMIP5 climate models and LSMs, where the uncertainty could be underestimated if using simulations with a single LSM (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">4</xref>). As compared with the LSM simulations driven by observed meteorological forcings, the CMIP5/ALL/LSM simulations underestimate the national-averaged flash drought frequency, but it is within the uncertainty of LSMs (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">5</xref>). Without using LSM ensemble simulations, the uncertainty range for the drought frequency might be underestimated by 21–44% (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">5</xref>).
