 <xref rid="grl56847-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>a shows the seasonality in the surface heat flux response associated with sea ice loss in the RCP8.5 scenario. In all the CMIP5 models, the largest heat flux response is found in the cold season, which implies a transfer of heat from the ocean to the atmosphere as also shown in previous single‐model experiments (e.g., Deser et al.,
