<p class="p">Further insight is obtained by inspecting the spatial distribution in the multimodel mean response. In early winter (October‐November‐December, OND) Arctic sea ice loss mostly affects the central Arctic ocean, where sea ice concentration is reduced by up to 90% (Figure 
 <xref rid="grl56847-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>a). In all these areas additional heat fluxes up to 40 W m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> are transferred from the ocean to the atmosphere (Figure 
 <xref rid="grl56847-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>b). A different spatial distribution is found in late winter (January‐February‐March, JFM), when central Arctic sea ice has largely re‐formed and sea ice loss is confined to the Arctic marginal seas, particularly Hudson Bay, Barents and Kara Seas, the Bering Strait, and the Sea of Okhotsk (Figure 
 <xref rid="grl56847-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>d). In these areas the surface heat flux is locally increased by up to 75 W m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>, which reflects the increased contrast between cold air masses forming over sea ice in the central Arctic and the exposed ocean in the Arctic marginal seas (Figure 
 <xref rid="grl56847-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>e).
