<p class="p">These results suggest that the CMIP5 multimodel mean future projections feature seasonal variations in the circulation response that are potentially consistent with the surface forcing from Arctic sea ice loss, particularly in the North Atlantic sector and at high latitudes. This will now be tested by comparing the circulation response in RCP8.5 to that found under the AMIPFuture and AMIP4xCO2 experiments, where sea ice is unperturbed.</p>
