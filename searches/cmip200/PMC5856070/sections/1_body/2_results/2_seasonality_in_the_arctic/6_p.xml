<p class="p">Together with these surface Arctic seasonal changes, substantial variations between early and late winter are found in the atmospheric circulation response (Figures

 <xref rid="grl56847-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>f). In the North Atlantic, a dipole in the zonal wind at 850 hPa reflecting the poleward shift of the jet is found in OND but not in JFM. A predominantly easterly wind response develops around the Arctic circle in JFM. The pattern in the North Pacific wind response shifts slightly southward from early to late winter, but the character of the response is not qualitatively affected.
