<p class="p">Given the strong seasonality in the Arctic surface forcing, it could be expected that its influence on atmospheric circulation should be most detectable in the cold season. Consistent with previous studies on the seasonality of jet responses (Barnes &amp; Polvani,

The multimodel mean even shows a southward shift of the jet in February. Such a seasonal southward anomaly in the jet response is consistent with the expected impact from sea ice loss on atmospheric circulation. This connection would imply that the circulation response lags the Arctic surface heat flux forcing by about 1Â month, which is a reasonable time lag for atmospheric stationary perturbations to grow in response to anomalies in the SST and sea ice (Deser et al.,
