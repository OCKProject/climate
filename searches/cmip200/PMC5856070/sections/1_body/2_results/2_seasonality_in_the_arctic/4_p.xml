<p class="p">The North Pacific jet also tends to shift poleward with climate change (Figure 
 <xref rid="grl56847-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>c). However, in contrast to the Atlantic region, the poleward shift of the Pacific jet is abated by only about half a degree in the multimodel mean from autumn to winter, while the minimum in the poleward shift of the jet occurs in June. This suggests that the seasonality in the North Pacific jet response to climate change is not primarily influenced by the surface fluxes associated with Arctic sea ice loss but is rather conditioned by tropical processes (Shaw &amp; Voigt,
