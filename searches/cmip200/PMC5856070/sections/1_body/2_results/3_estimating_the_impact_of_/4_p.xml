 <xref rid="grl56847-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>c show that RCP8.5 is characterized by substantially larger near‐surface atmospheric warming in the Arctic region compared to AMIPsst+co2, which reflects the lack of sea ice changes in AMIPsst+co2. The oceanic surface warming is instead comparable (see Figure 
 <xref rid="grl56847-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref>), so we can be confident that the differences in the circulation response between RCP8.5 and AMIPsst+co2 are most strongly influenced by the forcing due to sea ice loss rather than by SST differences.
