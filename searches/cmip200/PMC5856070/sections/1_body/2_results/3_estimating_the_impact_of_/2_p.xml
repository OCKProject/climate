<p class="p">The multimodel mean jet latitude response in the AMIPFuture and AMIP4xCO2 experiments are presented in Figure 
 <xref rid="grl56847-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>a, together with the mean response in the RCP8.5 scenario evaluated for the 10 coupled models corresponding to the AMIP experiments. While both the SST forcing (AMIPFuture) and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> forcing (AMIP4xCO2) are individually sufficient to generate a poleward shift of the North Atlantic jet, neither of them is able to reproduce the significant suppression of the jet shift found in JFM in the RCP8.5 scenario (Figure 
 <xref rid="grl56847-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>a). In particular, in AMIP4xCO2 the poleward shift of the jet is largest in the cold season, and almost all models show a poleward shift of the jet in JFM (Figure 
 <xref rid="grl56847-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>b). A slight suppression of the poleward shift of the jet is found in late winter in AMIPFuture, but the multimodel mean still shows a 1Â° poleward shift. Therefore, these results support the hypothesis that SST and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> forcing, in the absence of sea ice changes, are unable to generate the late winter suppression of the North Atlantic poleward jet shift found in the RCP8.5 projections.
