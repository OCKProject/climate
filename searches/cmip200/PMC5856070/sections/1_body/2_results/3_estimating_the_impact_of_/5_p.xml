<p class="p">The mean sea level pressure (MSLP) responses in RCP8.5 and AMIPsst+co2 are similar in the Pacific but are substantially different over North America, Europe, and Asia (Figures

 <xref rid="grl56847-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>f). Compared to AMIPsst+co2, the RCP8.5 response features higher surface pressure in northern Siberia and lower pressure in both North America and, with less model agreement, in the Mediterranean. At 500 hPa, the geopotential height increases in both experiments as a result of tropospheric warming, but in the Arctic the height increase in RCP8.5 is approximately twice that in AMIPsst+co2 (Figures

 <xref rid="grl56847-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>h). Therefore, the difference between the RCP8.5 and AMIPsst+co2 response is characterized by an equivalent barotropic pressure increase extending through the depth of the Arctic troposphere. Consistently, the difference in the zonal wind at 850 hPa between RCP8.5 and AMIPsst+co2 (Figures

 <xref rid="grl56847-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>i) is dominated by a weakening of the westerly flow at 60°N, which is strongest in the North Atlantic sector, together with a slight, and less robust, strengthening further south in the oceanic basins. The same analyses have also been repeated using the abrupt4xCO2 (Figure
