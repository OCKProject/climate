<p class="p">In contrast to these atmospheric circulation differences found in late winter, the early winter (OND) response is similar in RCP8.5 and AMIPsst+co2 (see Figure

Furthermore, the difference in the Arctic response is baroclinic in OND, with an increase in Z500 but a lowering of the surface pressure. Such a shift from a baroclinic to a barotropic response during the cold season is also a feature of sea ice perturbation experiments (Barnes &amp; Polvani,
