<p class="p">An open research question is the extent to which the late winter circulation response is mediated by a change in the strength of the stratospheric vortex (Wu &amp; Smith, 
 <xref rid="grl56847-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Although beyond the scope of this paper, we find that the seasonal evolution in the response of the vortex matches that in the North Atlantic jet latitude, as the vortex strengthens in autumn (until November) and then weakens until March (Figure

 <xref rid="grl56847-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S5)</xref>. This supports the view that the stratospheric vortex strength and North Atlantic jet latitude responses are related, as also found across the CMIP5 intermodel spread (Zappa &amp; Shepherd,
