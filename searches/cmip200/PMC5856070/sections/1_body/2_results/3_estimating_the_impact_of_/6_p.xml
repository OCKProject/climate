In particular, the increase in surface pressure in the northern North Atlantic and northern Siberia, the pressure reduction over North America, the increase in Arctic geopotential height, and the weakening of the high‐latitude westerly flow, including the North Atlantic sector, are common features of these studies. This gives us high confidence in interpreting the difference between RCP8.5 and AMIPsst+co2 as evidence for robust impacts of sea ice loss on the atmospheric circulation response in the CMIP5 models. Interestingly, other aspects of the identified response are present in some, but not all, of the single‐model experiments. In particular, a large pressure reduction in the Mediterranean area in response to sea ice loss is only present in Blackport and Kushner (
 <xref rid="grl56847-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). Many studies have found a stronger Aleutian pressure deepening in response to sea ice loss, although this might result from the indirect effects of sea ice loss on global SST changes (Deser et al., 
 <xref rid="grl56847-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>), which cannot be separated using this approach.
