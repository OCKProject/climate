<p class="p">To quantitatively explore the role of sea ice loss in JFM, we now compare in Figure 
 <xref rid="grl56847-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> the RCP8.5 response to the combined AMIPsst+co2 mean response (see section 
 <xref rid="grl56847-sec-0004" ref-type="sec" class="xref">2.2</xref>). To estimate robustness (indicated as stippling), the scaling from equationÂ 
 <xref rid="grl56847-disp-0001" ref-type="disp-formula" class="xref">(1)</xref> has been applied to the individual models, so as to pairwise compare the RCP8.5 and AMIPsst+co2 responses. These robustness estimates are conservative as the patterns in the SST response of an individual model in RCP8.5 will in general be different from that in AMIPFuture, and these SST variations can mask the coherence in the signal from sea ice loss.
