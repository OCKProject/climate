<p class="p">If sea ice loss exerts a substantial impact on midlatitude circulation, then a signature of its influence should be identifiable not just in the intermodel spread but also in the mean of the CMIP5 models' future projections. This will be investigated here by comparing the multimodel mean circulation response in the RCP8.5 scenario to the circulation response induced by SST warming and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> increase alone. These responses are available thanks to the AMIPFuture and AMIP4xCO2 CMIP5 experiments, in which SSTs and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentrations have been respectively increased while sea ice is kept at present day values. Sea ice loss‚Äêrelated signals should thus be detectable as features of the RCP8.5 response that cannot be explained by the AMIPFuture and AMIP4xCO2 experiments. Although the approach requires assumptions on the linearity and state independence of the circulation response to forcing, it represents the first attempt to identify the impact of sea ice loss on atmospheric circulation in a large ensemble of climate models.
