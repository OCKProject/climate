<p class="p">The impact of Arctic sea ice loss on the atmospheric circulation has been analyzed using a novel approach in the CMIP5 future projections. Several of the identified impacts of sea ice loss on atmospheric circulation are consistent with the published literature based on single‐model experiments. This gives credence to the interpretation of these results and suggests that aspects of the circulation response to projected sea ice loss are robust to model formulation. In particular,

   <p class="p">In late winter, Arctic sea ice loss also tends to increase the surface pressure in northern Siberia and to lower it in North America and in the Mediterranean area, although the latter response is less robust across CMIP5 models.</p>
