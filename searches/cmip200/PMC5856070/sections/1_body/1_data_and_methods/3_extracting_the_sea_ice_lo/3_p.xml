<p class="p">Three assumptions are implied in this approach: (1) linear scaling and additivity of the circulation response to the SST and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> forcing, (2) linearity of the circulation response to the different SST patterns found in the CMIP5 future responses, and (3) independence of the circulation response to the differences in the circulation basic states between the AMIP and coupled runs. Additivity is often implied when separating the impact of sea ice and SST changes (Blackport &amp; Kushner,

 <xref rid="grl56847-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) and found to be reasonably well satisfied (McCusker et al.,

 <xref rid="grl56847-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). The proportional scaling of the circulation response between different emission scenarios suggests that the linearity in the magnitude of the forcing is also approximately satisfied (Ceppi et al.,

 <xref rid="grl56847-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). However, deviations from linearity can exist in the response to SST anomalies (e.g., Robinson et al., 
 <xref rid="grl56847-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>). Finally, a strong sensitivity in the climate response to circulation biases induced by SST biases has been found in Smith et al. (
 <xref rid="grl56847-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>), while other studies have found weaker (Osborne et al., 
 <xref rid="grl56847-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>; Screen &amp; Francis, 
 <xref rid="grl56847-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>) or no (McCusker et al., 
 <xref rid="grl56847-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>) state dependencies. Deviations from these assumptions can lead to confounding effects, but these effects would have to be large and consistent across the CMIP5 models to overcome the signal from sea ice loss. Comparison of our findings with results from previous single‚Äêmodel experiments will enable us to test our approach a posteriori.
