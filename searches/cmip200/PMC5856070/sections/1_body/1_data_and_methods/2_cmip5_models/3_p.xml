<p class="p">For a subset of 10 models (see Table 
 <xref rid="grl56847-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref>), the RCP8.5 response is compared to the climate response obtained from the corresponding atmosphere‐only AMIP, AMIPFuture, and AMIP4xCO2 simulations. AMIP simulations are transient runs forced by observed variability in SSTs, sea ice extent, and atmospheric composition for the period 1979–2008. AMIP4xCO2 is an AMIP run where the CO

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> experiment and scaled to have a global average of 4° (K). Sea ice extent is kept unchanged at present‐day values in both AMIP4xCO2 and AMIPFuture. Climatologies are computed as time averages for 1979–2008.
