 </sup>, namely SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5, each of which was contributed by a different IAM (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>), as well as two of the Tier 2 scenarios, namely SSP4-3.4 and SSP4-6.0, both of which were contributed by the GCAM IAM
