<p id="Par12" class="p">We find that societal choices will substantially impact riverine total nitrogen loading for the continental United States by the end of the century, and that regional impacts will be even larger. Future changes in precipitation will exacerbate loading increases. Although increased loading is possible for both high- and low-emission pathways, we find that limiting climate change and eutrophication can also be achieved concurrently. Increases in cropland area and agricultural intensification will likely impact other parts of the world as well, including vast portions of Asia.</p>
