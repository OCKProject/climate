<p id="Par8" class="p">Projected future changes due to land conversion to cropland or developed land and changes in fertilizer application rates as considered here are based on integrated land use and emission scenarios obtained by combining shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs, a.k.a. socioeconomic development pathways) and representative concentration pathways (RCPs, a.k.a. climate outcomes)

 </sup>. These five SSPs represent state-of-the-art prototypical pathways for global environmental change during the 21st century, including projections under assumptions ranging from sustainable growth to increased consumption over the period 2015–2100. These SSPs, however, are not intended to represent a comprehensive set of possible futures, and other pathways have also been proposed
