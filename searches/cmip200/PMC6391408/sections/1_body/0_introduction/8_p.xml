<p id="Par10" class="p">In addition, examining the combined impacts of socioeconomic development pathways and changes in precipitation patterns associated with a particular climate outcome can provide insight into whether direct and indirect impacts of anthropogenic activity will compound or offset one another in terms of their effects on nitrogen loading. We therefore also examine the joint influence of direct (via land use and land management) and indirect (via climate change-induced changes in precipitation patterns) societal impacts on future TN loading. Future changes in precipitation patterns are based on projections from CMIP5 models
