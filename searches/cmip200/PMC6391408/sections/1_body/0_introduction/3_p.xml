One recent study, however, used precipitation projections from 21 GCMs to examine changes in total nitrogen (TN) export for the entire continental United States, finding that changes in precipitation patterns alone could increase riverine TN export for the continental United States by 19% by the end-of-the-century for a business-as-usual scenario
