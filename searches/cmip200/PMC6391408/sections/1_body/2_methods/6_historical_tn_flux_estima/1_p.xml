For the historical period we utilized observation-based NANI estimates (see Section “Historical and future NANI datasets”), land use based on historical LUH2 dataset (see Section “Historical and future land use and fertilizer application datasets”), and precipitation projections from 21 CMIP5 models (see Section “Historical and future precipitation datasets”). This approach is analogous to that used in an earlier study
