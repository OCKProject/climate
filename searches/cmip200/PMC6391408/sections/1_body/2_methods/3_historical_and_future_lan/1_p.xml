 </sup> dataset prepared for the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). The LUH2 dataset includes land use scenarios for 12 land use categories (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>) and provides land management scenarios that include fertilizer application rate for five crop types for all global land grid cells at 1/4
 <bold class="bold">°</bold> spatial resolution and annual temporal resolution. The LUH2 dataset is available for two time periods, with the historical (LUH2 v2h) period covering 850–2015 and the future period (LUH2 v2f) covering 2015–2100. For the future time period, land use and land management scenarios are available for five Shared SSP, each of which is coupled with a corresponding representative concentration pathway (RCP) or climate outcome (SSP1 with RCP2.6, SSP2 with RCP4.5, SSP3 with RCP7.0, SSP4 with RCP3.4, SSP4 with RCP6.0, and SSP5 with RCP8.5), yielding six combined scenarios overall because the SSP4 pathway is coupled to two different RCPs. Although multiple IAMs generated scenarios for each pathway, the scenarios compiled in the LUH2 dataset are based on the marker IAM for each pathway (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>). Within the LUH2 database, the IAM outputs of various scenarios were harmonized such that the future projections for the six SSPs smoothly connect with the historical projections

 </sup>. This harmonization process results in a shift in the future scenario projections from the original IAM estimates for a portion of the future period.
