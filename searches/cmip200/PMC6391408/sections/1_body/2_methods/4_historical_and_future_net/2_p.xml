 </sup> for 1987–2005. NANI for 1976–1986 was estimated by modifying this methodology to accommodate a more limited data record during this decade. Briefly, fertilizer rates for 1987–2005, 1985–1986, and 1976–1984 were obtained from three earlier studies

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" class="xref">71</xref>
 </sup>. The NADP monitoring network was established in 1978, but had very few monitoring stations in that initial year. Atmospheric deposition rates for 1976, 1977, and 1978 were therefore assumed remain constant at 1979 levels. Agricultural nitrogen fixation, net food and feed import, and nonfood crop export were estimated for the agricultural census years of 1987, 1992, 1997, 2002, and 2007 using the NANI toolbox

 </sup> and for the intervening years (1988–1991; 1993–1996; 1998–2001; 2003–2006) using linear interpolation. For the years preceding 1987, agricultural nitrogen fixation and net food and feed import were estimated for each HUC8 watershed by extrapolating a linear trend estimated based on the values for 1987, 1992, 2997, 2002, 2007, and 2012. Nonfood crop export, which are an extremely small component of NANI (on average 0.78% of NANI), were assumed to remain at 1987 levels for 1976–1986.
