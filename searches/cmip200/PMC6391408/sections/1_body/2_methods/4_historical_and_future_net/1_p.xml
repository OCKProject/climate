<p id="Par27" class="p">Nitrogen input to the watersheds was captured in the form of net anthropogenic nitrogen input (NANI), which is defined as the sum of five components: fertilizer nitrogen input, agricultural nitrogen fixation, net food and feed import, atmospheric deposition, and nonfood crop export. Net food and feed import accounts for crop and animal nitrogen production (removal of nitrogen from the watershed) and human and animal nitrogen consumption (addition of nitrogen to the watershed) and includes bioenergy production and consumption. The nonfood crop export represents the nitrogen in cotton and tobacco harvested for sale and exported elsewhere for nonfood use. On average during the historical period, fertilizer was +72% of NANI; fixation was +45% of NANI; deposition was+ 14% of NANI; food and feed import was −30% of NANI (negative sign designates net export over the continental United States); and nonfood crop export was+ 0.78% of NANI. The nonfood crop export represents nitrogen leaving the watershed and its value is subtracted from NANI while all other components are added to estimate NANI. NANI was estimated using two different methods. First, for the empirical model development and for assessing historical TN loading, available data on the various NANI components was used to estimate historical NANI. Second, for estimating future TN loading, NANI estimates were developed based on output available in the LUH2 dataset. In addition, historical NANI was also estimated directly based on LUH2 data in the analysis focusing on isolating the impact of future changes to cropland area, developed land, or fertilizer application rates, in the absence of concurrent changes to the other factors. The first approach is described here, while the second is presented in Section “Future changes in TN flux due to change in land use and land management”.</p>
