 </sup> that relates precipitation, land use, and NANI to TN loading at the HUC8 scale was developed based on land use categories included in National Land Cover Database 2006 (NLCD 2006). There is, however, no simple correspondence between the NLCD 2006 land use categories and those reported in the LUH2 dataset. Rather than create an approximate mapping, we instead developed a modified model, with model selection and model calibration based directly on the land use variables available in the LUH2 dataset. The approach was analogous to the earlier study
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">19</xref>
 </sup>, with the following differences. The 12 land use categories of LUH2 dataset were aggregated into six categories as illustrated in Supplementary TableÂ

 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">19</xref>
 </sup>, all six land use categories and all their combinations were considered in the model selection. In addition, because the observation-based NANI data are now available through 2012
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" class="xref">72</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73" class="xref">73</xref>
 </sup>, the calibration dataset included the same catchments as the earlier study
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">19</xref>
 </sup>, but observed TN loading for 2012 was added where available. The total number of catchment-years for model build was thus increased from 242 to 280. Also, whereas the NLCD database only provides land use for a single year, the LUH2 dataset provides annual values for all land use categories, and land use was therefore no longer held constant over time.
