<p id="Par33" class="p">For the future period, three of the NANI components (fertilizer nitrogen input, agricultural nitrogen fixation, and net food and feed import) were estimated based on the future LUH2 dataset for the six scenarios (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">8</xref>). The LUH2 dataset provides fertilizer application rates for five different crop types (C3 annual crops, C4 annual crops, C3 perennial crops, C4 perennial crops, and C3 nitrogen-fixing crops). Fertilizer usage was obtained by summing the area-weighted fertilizer application rate for all crop types. The fertilizer usage was scaled such that estimates from 1987 to 2012 period (obtained from LUH2 v2h) matched existing estimates of fertilizer usage

 </sup>. Future food and feed import, which includes bioenergy production and consumption, was estimated using future fertilizer nitrogen input and agricultural nitrogen fixation for each HUC2 region under the assumption that the relationship between food and feed import and fertilizer input and agricultural nitrogen fixation will remain constant over time. The estimate was based on a multiple linear regression with historical food and feed import as the dependent variable, and historical fertilizer nitrogen input and historical agricultural nitrogen fixation as the independent variables (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">9</xref>). Data on historical values for all three variables for 1987, 1992, 1997, 2002, 2007, and 2012 were obtained from the NANI toolbox

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73" class="xref">73</xref>
 </sup>. Future food and feed import is estimated as a function of fertilizer usage and agricultural nitrogen fixation; therefore, reductions in fertilizer usage resulting from either improvements in nitrogen use efficiency or reductions in cropland area will also impact the nitrogen embedded in net food and feed import. The fourth NANI component, atmospheric deposition was estimated based on existing future NOx deposition estimates

 </sup> for the RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5 emission scenarios, which are based on the community multiscale air quality (CMAQ) model, while the TN flux empirical model was developed by utilizing the National Atmospheric Deposition Program (NLCD) NOx deposition estimates. The future NOx deposition estimates were therefore adjusted based on scaling factor between CMAQ model based NOx deposition (obtained from

The fifth NANI component, nonfood crop export, is an extremely small component of NANI and was held constant at the 2007 value (i.e., the approximate value at the end of the historical period) for all years after 2007.
