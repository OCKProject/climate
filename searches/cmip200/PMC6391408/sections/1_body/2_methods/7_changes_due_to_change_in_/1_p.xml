<p id="Par32" class="p">The impact of future changes in land use and land management on TN flux was estimated using land use (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref>) and NANI (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">7</xref>) based on the six scenarios from the LUH2 dataset (as described below), and historical precipitation based on 21 CMIP5 models (see Section “Historical and future precipitation datasets”). The robustness of projected change in TN flux was assessed in a manner analogous to an earlier study
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">41</xref>
 </sup>, whereby a change is considered robust change if more than 50% of the models show a significant change, as assessed by a two-sided 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> test at the 95% confidence level, and more than 80% of the models agree on the sign of change
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74" class="xref">74</xref>
 </sup>. Because we are holding precipitation at historical levels, the only variability across the CMIP5 models for a given future land use and land management scenario therefore comes from how the historical precipitation patterns for a given CMIP5 model manifest themselves as TN loading in the framework of a given land use and land management scenario. In other words, a change in land use in a particular location of the country may have a different impact within the context of historical precipitation patterns as represented by one CMIP5 model vs. another.
