<p id="Par35" class="p">The combined impact of changes in land use and land management and changes in precipitation patterns on future TN flux was examined by estimating TN fluxes for future periods based on LUH2-dataset-derived NANI and land use (six scenarios), and precipitation projections based on CMIP5 models (four climate outcomes). Bias-corrected and downscaled (1/8Â°) precipitation projections were obtained from the CMIP5 archive

 </sup>, which includes 21, 16, 20, 12, and 21 models for the historical, RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5 climate outcomes, respectively. We assessed the joint influence of direct and indirect impacts by combining the six scenarios with the most similar climate outcome available from CMIP5 simulations. The SSP scenarios for which the equivalent concentration pathway exists in CMIP5 were paired. As such, SSP1-2.6 was combined with precipitation based on RCP2.6, SSP2-4.5 was combined with RCP4.5, SSP4-6.0 was combined with RCP6.0, and SSP5-8.5 was combined with the high-emission RCP8.5. The SSP scenarios for which a corresponding concentration pathway is not available within the CMIP5 simulations were paired with the most similar available pathway. Thus, the SSP4-3.4 scenario was paired with RCP2.6. The SSP3-7.0 scenario is described as combining "high societal vulnerability with high forcing"
