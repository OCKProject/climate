<p id="Par18" class="p">We further find that change in cropland area, developed area, and fertilizer application rate are all important contributors to future changes in TN flux (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>, Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">4</xref>). Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> reproduces the information from Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2c</xref> with historical climate, but also illustrates the changes in loading resulting only from changes to cropland area (and associated fertilizer application), only from changes to developed land area, and only from changes in fertilizer application rates. For most scenarios and regions, more than one of these factors contributes substantially to the overall impact. As described earlier, the primary driver of the projected changes to cropland area is increased biofuel production for the SSP1-2.6 and SSP4-3.4 scenarios

 </sup>. The primary drivers of projected changes to developed land area are population growth and rates of urbanization. For fertilizer application rates, the primary drivers mirror those of changes to cropland area.
