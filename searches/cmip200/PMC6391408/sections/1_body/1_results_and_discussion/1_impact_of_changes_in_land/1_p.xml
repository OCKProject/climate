<p id="Par13" class="p">We find that future societal choices about land use and land management will have dramatic impacts on riverine TN loading; across the six prototypical scenarios examined here, impacts range from an increase of 54% (SSP4-3.4 Inequality (3.4)) to a decrease of 7% (SSP5-8.5 Fossil-fueled development) by the end-of-the-century for the continental United States (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref>) in the absence of changes in precipitation patterns. Differences in riverine TN loading depend on the scales of agricultural production and anthropogenic nitrogen input, which in turn depend on global demand for food, demand for bioenergy, assumptions about trade, and assumptions about agricultural management practices. Demand for food depends on global population, income, and diet, while bioenergy depends on the degree of climate mitigation and the cost and availability of mitigation options. For the continental United States, the SSP4-3.4 scenario, which assumes low emissions, high climate mitigation, and moderately high demand for domestic food production, would increase TN loading by 54% (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>, Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1b</xref>), due primarily to increased production of bioenergy, and associated fertilizer application

 </sup>. Similarly, the projected increases in TN loading for the SSP3-7.0 Regional rivalry scenario is also due to an expansion of agricultural land in the United States, but this time resulting from rising demand for domestic food production

 </sup>. For the SSP4-6.0 Inequality (6.0) scenario, the projected increase in TN loading arises from a high demand for both food and bioenergy production, with the latter being lower than for the SSP4-3.4 scenario

 </sup>. In contrast, the SSP5-8.5 scenario associated with very high greenhouse gas emissions would lead to a modest decrease in future TN loading of 7%, attributable to a small growth in population in the United States and no climate mitigation efforts, resulting in lower agricultural demand and fertilizer use. Any increase in food demand within the United States would be met by livestock intensification, improvements in fertilizer use efficiency, and increased import of food

 </sup>. Overall, the majority of examined scenarios are associated with increased TN loading, and the magnitudes of these increases outweigh the decreases for the remaining scenarios. The most dramatic projected changes would occur for the end-of-the-century period (2071–2100), although changes ranging from an increase of 16% to a decrease of 13% are also projected by the middle-of-the-century (2031–2060; Supplementary Figures
