<p id="Par17" class="p">The impacts of societal pathways on nitrogen loading are highly variable across regions, with the relative magnitude of some of the regional impacts dwarfing those observed at the continental scale (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). For instance, all six scenarios would result in a robust increase in loading for the Northeast region by the end-of-the-century relative to the historical period, with increases ranging from 17% (SSP5-8.5) to 374% (SSP3-7.0). Conversely, three of the scenarios that would result in increased loading for the continental United States by the end-of-the-century would actually result in a decreased loading within the Mississippi-Atchafalaya River Basin (MARB), namely the SSP1-2.6, SSP4-6.0, and SSP3-7.0 scenarios (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). The projected decrease in future MARB loading relative to the historical period (1976–2005) is due to a decrease in cropland area between 1997 and 2015 that is not fully offset by land use changes through to the middle-of-the-century and end-of-the-century periods (Supplementary Figure

The scale and heterogeneity in regional impacts indicates that impacts of broader societal pathways may be highly geographically uneven, with clear winners and losers in terms of impacts on eutrophication. In the case of the Northeast and the MARB, both of these regions already have high historical loading (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>), such that any long-term trends are likely to have important consequences on regional water quality. The risks and uncertainty associated with regional differences in impacts are further compounded by differences across IAMs in their representations of specific scenarios (Fig.
