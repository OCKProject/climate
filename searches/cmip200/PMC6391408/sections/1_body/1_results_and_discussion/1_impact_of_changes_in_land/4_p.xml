<p id="Par16" class="p">How society will evolve in the future is uncertain, even under a common set of high-level assumptions about economic futures and population dynamics. As a result, the assumptions prescribed for each societal pathway manifest themselves differently as a function of the IAM used to represent the pathway (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). In the LUH2 dataset, the scenarios for the SSP4-3.4 and SSP4-6.0 scenarios are based on simulations from the GCAM model

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">51</xref>
 </sup>, while the four other scenarios are based on four other IAMs (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>). Examining differences in scenarios generated by different IAMs for a given combination of socioeconomic development pathway and climate outcome gives a qualitative sense of both the uncertainty associated with societal response under given assumptions, and the model uncertainty associated with the use of any particular IAM. With this goal in mind, here we compare total fertilizer use projections from the LUH2 database to projections for all six scenarios based on the GCAM model. We do not compare impacts on TN loading directly, because spatially explicit and harmonized GCAM outputs are not available for all six scenarios; however, the differences in fertilizer use (which stem from changes in land use and changes in fertilizer application rate) would result in corresponding differences in loading if the requisite data were available. The GCAM model implementation of the SSP1-2.6 and SSP2-4.5 scenarios result in much larger cropland area and fertilizer usage relative to the corresponding marker scenarios in the LUH2 database, because the GCAM scenario assumes a much stronger reliance on biofuels. More broadly, for the four SSPs for which GCAM was not used as the LUH2 marker scenario, the average magnitude of the difference in fertilizer usage in 2100 between the GCAM implementation of a given scenario and the corresponding LUH2 marker scenario is 8.1 Tg N, which is greater than the full spread across the LUH2 database for these four scenarios (7.0 Tg N, Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>). Recently released global fertilizer usage estimates for the five SSPs used here based on the IMAGE IAM also illustrate the differences implied by the choice of IAM
