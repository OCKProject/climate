<p id="Par15" class="p">The possible magnitude of changes to TN loading resulting from the land use and land management scenarios considered here (up to 54% by the end-of-the-century) is even greater than the magnitude of possible TN loading increases due to future changes in precipitation (up to 19% by the end-of-the-century) reported in an earlier study

 </sup>. In addition, the range of possible changes across the six scenarios considered here (+54 to âˆ’7%), which can be thought of as an approximate measure of uncertainty in future TN loading changes resulting from anthropogenic activity within the continental United States, is also substantially larger than the range across future climate outcomes (+11% to +19%

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">41</xref>
 </sup>). This comparison indicates that changes to the physical climate system must be considered when evaluating risks associated with future eutrophication, but that anthropogenic activity within the affected regions (via land use and land management) has an even stronger potential influence on loading.
