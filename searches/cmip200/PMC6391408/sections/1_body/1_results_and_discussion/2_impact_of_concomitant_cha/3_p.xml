 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">6</xref>), suggesting that the overall scale of direct and indirect anthropogenic impacts is likely to be substantially larger than when considering climate alone. Globally, among regions with nonzero fertilizer use during the historical period (colored land regions in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5a</xref>), the direction of change in fertilizer usage is consistent for at least five of the six examined scenarios for 67% of land area (colored regions in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5b</xref>). Regions in South, East, and Southeast Asia stand out relative to other regions in having both high-historical fertilizer usage and a robust and large projected increase in fertilizer use, placing them at a high risk for a substantial future increase in eutrophication. These regions also coincide with those identified in an earlier study

 </sup> as being at high risk for future increases in eutrophication based on their high-historical precipitation and robust projected future increase in precipitation. When taken together, these two sets of analyses indicate that climate and societal changes are likely to conspire in this region to substantially impact inland and coastal water quality. Such intensified eutrophication could substantially impact water supplies, fisheries, and ecosystems. It is important to note, however, that the prototypical pathways examined here do not cover all possible outcomes, which will depend in no small part on policy and legislative action by individual countries. For example, future nitrogen use efficiency may improve in China and India as both countries are now increasing efforts to reduce nitrogen pollution by encouraging farmers to adopt best management practices
