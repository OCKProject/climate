<p id="Par22" class="p">Overall, we find that societal choices about land use and land management will have dramatic impacts on future nitrogen loading within the continental United States. In some cases, climate mitigation efforts could result in unintended increases in eutrophication, but opportunities to concurrently limit climate change and eutrophication do exist. Climate-induced changes in precipitation will exacerbate any loading increases due intensification of land use, or reduce the benefits of improved land management. Globally, South, East, and Southeast Asia will likely experience increased eutrophication by the end-of-the-century given projected trends in land use, land management, and precipitation across the majority of scenarios examined here. These results imply that strategies aimed at reducing eutrophication and associated water quality impacts must be based on an assessment of the combined impacts of changes in socioeconomic development and climate. Whereas some societal pathways can achieve climate mitigation while increasing food production, other mitigation pathways may have significant detrimental impact on environmental sustainability.</p>
