<p id="Par20" class="p">Concomitant climate-induced changes in precipitation can either amplify TN flux increases or negate TN flux reductions due to land management, and the impacts of land use and land management and those of climate are not necessarily simply additive (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). For example, the reductions in TN fluxes for the continental United States resulting from anticipated changes in land use and land management for the SSP2-4.5 and the SSP5-8.5 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>) scenarios would be fully offset by the impacts of projected changes in precipitation patterns. For the four other scenarios, the increases in TN fluxes would be further amplified by projected changes in precipitation patterns. As expected, the additional impact of climate would be greatest for scenarios associated with more extensive changes to climate (SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5). Taken together, whereas the range of anticipated changes in the absence of concomitant changes to climate is −7 to 54% for the continental US, this range becomes 1–68% when both sets of drivers are taken into account. In addition, as previously noted

 </sup>, the impacts of climate-change-induced precipitation changes are themselves regionally heterogeneous. The Northeast exhibits the strongest impacts both when considering land management alone (with loading increases ranging from 17 to 374%) and when considering the additional impacts of climate change (with total loading increases from both drivers ranging from 45 to 492%). In addition, in some cases the impacts of land management and climate changes are not additive (e.g., SSP3-7.0 scenario in the Northeast; Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1f</xref>), illustrating the importance of considering these two sets of drivers concurrently. It is noteworthy that for some scenarios such as SSP2-4.5, decreases in nutrient loading due to changes in land management can help to offset increases in loading that would result from changes in precipitation patterns associated with the corresponding climate outcome. Such examples point to the possibility of not only limiting impacts of land management change on nutrient loading (as discussed earlier), but indeed of using land management to address eutrophication resulting from changes to the physical climate system.
