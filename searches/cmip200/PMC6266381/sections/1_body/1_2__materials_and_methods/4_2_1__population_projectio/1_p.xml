 <xref rid="B41-ijerph-15-02438" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. ICLUS v2 uses county population from the 2010 Census as the starting point for projecting population. Age-specific fertility, mortality and net immigration rates specific to SSPs [
 <xref rid="B51-ijerph-15-02438" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>] were used in ICLUS to develop US population projections to 2100. The fourth U.S. National Climate Assessment (NCA4) [
 <xref rid="B52-ijerph-15-02438" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>] provided guidance for using population projections that are consistent with the risk-based approach. Following the NCA4 guidance, our analysis focuses on SSP2 and SSP5 U.S. population projections to represent our best estimate and high-population future respectively. Domestic migration was estimated with the use of a gravity model calibrated with annual Internal Revenue Service (IRS) county-to-county migration records for the years 1991–2000 [
 <xref rid="B53-ijerph-15-02438" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. Boundaries for Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical areas (MSAs) [
 <xref rid="B54-ijerph-15-02438" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>] were used to aggregate IRS migration data for both calibration and projection steps to remove high-frequency, intra-urban mobility. County-to-county migration outside of MSAs was also included in both calibration and projection steps. All components of change—fertility, mortality, international and domestic migration—were modeled on an annual time step. The resulting projections describe divergent, but plausible, distributions of population in 2090, with national totals ranging from 449 million in SSP2 to more than 678 million under SSP5. The projections are further differentiated by assumptions regarding domestic migration and international immigration, each of which affect the spatial distribution of population. Additional documentation of the ICLUS v2 model and projections is available elsewhere [
