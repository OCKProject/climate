<p class="p">We also present summary results at subnational levels. We use the National Climate Assessment regions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-02438-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>) to present population and heat-mortality results. Several of the regions are expected to experience substantial population growth (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-02438-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). For example, the population in the Southeast is projected to increase, from 79 m people in 2010 to 116 m in 2090 for the SSP2 scenario and to over 169 m for the SSP5 scenario.
