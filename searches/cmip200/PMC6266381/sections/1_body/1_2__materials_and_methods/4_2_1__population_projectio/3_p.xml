 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-02438-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>) are driven by multiple assumptions used to create the projections. Relative to SSP5, the SSP2 scenario assumes lower fertility, higher mortality, and lower net immigration for all years over the projected time period. In addition, SSP2 assumes a continuation of domestic migration patterns observed during the years 1991 to 2000. The flow of net migration during this time period was generally down the urban hierarchy, that is, towards less populated areas [

 <xref rid="B56-ijerph-15-02438" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. For several populous metropolitan areas, these assumptions result in a decreased total population under the SSP2 scenario (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-02438-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>A). Conversely, natural population increase is greater under SSP5 (i.e., higher fertility, lower mortality) and net immigration is higher, relative to SSP2. Also, domestic migration flows towards Micropolitan Statistical Areas were intensified and make up a larger share of the total migrating population at each time step relative to SSP2. The combination of assumptions for SSP5 concentrates more population growth in urbanized, non-rural counties, although the large amount of population growth overall means that virtually all counties see some level of population increase by 2090 (
