<p class="p">We adopt such a risk-based perspective for this paper, both in the specific results we show for potential changes in heat-related mortality under a changing climate, and, more broadly, in the structure and capabilities of the new framework presented here, with a focus on the second category of recommendations from Weaver et al. [

 <xref rid="B49-ijerph-15-02438" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>], in this case human mortality, and by exploring the range of scientifically plausible future outcomes under uncertainty, including lower-probability, but high-consequence futures that might have a disproportionate impact on calculations of total risk. There is substantial uncertainty surrounding many of the inputs to a climate change and health study, and for some of these uncertainty sources (e.g., the effectiveness of adaptation measures or the impact of the urban heat island effect (UHI) on heat-related mortality), there is not much research to understand processes, or it may not be clear how to appropriately represent these inputs in models. For other sources, such as changes in climate and population, there may be a wide range of scientifically supported futures. Current best practice in risk-based framing is to develop plausible scenarios of the future which capture the full, relevant range (for a given assessment, planning, or decision context) of the uncertainty in data sources, models and projections. This approach has influenced our choice of climate models and population scenarios used here to develop the new heat mortality projections presented, as described in more detail below. For each of these choices, we quantify the number and distribution of temperature-related premature deaths attributable to changes in summer-season temperature in the 2085–2095 period.
