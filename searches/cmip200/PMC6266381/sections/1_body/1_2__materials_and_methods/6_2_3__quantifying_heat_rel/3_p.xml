 <xref rid="B37-ijerph-15-02438" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>], we calculate a health impact function. A health impact function incorporates: (i) a risk coefficient from the epidemiological literature; (ii) a baseline rate of death or disease among the population of interest; (iii) a count of the number of people exposed. Temperature-related mortality is estimated by applying the health impact function with both historical and projected climate, then calculating the difference between those results. We used BenMAP to populate and process the necessary inputs and calculate the results of the health impact function.
