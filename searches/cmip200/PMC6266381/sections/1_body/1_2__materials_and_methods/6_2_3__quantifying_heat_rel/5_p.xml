 <xref rid="B20-ijerph-15-02438" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. This case-crossover analysis explored the change in mortality occurring due to day-to-day changes in temperature across 50 U.S. cities between 1989 and 2000. The authors specified piecewise linear exposure variables to account for the potential J or U shape to the temperature-mortality relationship. The authors note that “… the exposure variable for heat took (a) value (of) zero when the minimum temperature was ≤17 °C …”. Thus, we imposed a threshold in the health impact function, calculating impacts only on days when the minimum temperature was at or above 17 °C. In a meta-analysis of 42 cities, the authors estimate a 5.74% (95% Confidence Interval 3.38 to 8.15) increase in the risk of death per each degree of minimum daily temperature above 17 °C. Using a national-pooled risk coefficient does not account for well-documented regional heterogeneity in the temperature-mortality relationship. However, data limitations currently prevent us from quantifying impacts using city-specific risk coefficients. The LOCA temperature surfaces (~7 km resolution) and ICLUS population projections were aggregated and disaggregated, respectively, to 12 km grid cells, which is the default spatial resolution for BenMAP. The temperature-mortality effect coefficient was applied to each 12 km grid cell, and the results aggregated by NCA region.
