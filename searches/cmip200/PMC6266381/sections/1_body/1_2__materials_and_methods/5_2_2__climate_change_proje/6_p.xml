<p class="p">The final choice of two climate models was guided primarily by the goal of bounding our analysis with medium (CCSM4) and high-sensitivity (MIROC-ESM-CHEM) climate model projections in an efficient manner—in other words, to bracket the upper-half of the range of simulated climate change in the full ensemble of available simulations. This is consistent with a risk-based approach to climate assessment, as articulated above, which recognizes that total risk is asymmetric with respect to the distribution of future outcomes, with “worst-case” futures playing a much greater role in risk assessments than “best-case” outcomes. In the interest of brevity, we refer to these models as “CCSM” and “MIROC” throughout the rest of this paper. Although there were several potential medium-sensitivity models from which to choose, we selected CCSM because results from that climate model have been used in forthcoming air quality modeling studies. In future phases, we plan to examine whether heat and air pollution are synergistic or antagonistic when modeling combined exposures.</p>
