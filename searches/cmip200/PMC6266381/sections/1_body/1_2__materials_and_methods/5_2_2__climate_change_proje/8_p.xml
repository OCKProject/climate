<p class="p">Similarly, under RCP8.5 the high-sensitivity climate model, MIROC, projects relatively large increases in warm days compared to CCSM. Interestingly, coastal areas of the southeastern U.S. show small changes regardless of climate model or scenario. We note that the maximum increase in this warm season metric was 134 days, which covers nearly the entire 152-day warm season. In other words, some areas that typically experience few if any days where minimum temperature exceeds 17 Â°C during the warm season could exceed that threshold for nearly the entire warm season in the future. This highlights the disruptive nature of climate change and the potential for resultant human health impacts.</p>
