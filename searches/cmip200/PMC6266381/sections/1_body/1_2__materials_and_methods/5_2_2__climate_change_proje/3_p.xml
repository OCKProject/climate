<p class="p">LOCA [
 <xref rid="B60-ijerph-15-02438" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>] is one of the newest statistical downscaling techniques in wide application. It was developed to address a variety of shortcomings of earlier approaches, especially preserving the daily sequence of weather events simulated by the driving General Circulation Model (GCM), essential for accurate representation of changes in extremes. LOCA has been applied to conterminous US temperature and precipitation fields from CMIP5 output for RCPs 4.5 and 8.5. These downscaled LOCA data are distributed publicly through the U.S. Bureau of Reclamationâ€™s downscaled climate information portal [
