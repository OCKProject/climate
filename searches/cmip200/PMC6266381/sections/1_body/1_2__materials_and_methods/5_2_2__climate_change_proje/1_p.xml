<p class="p">The emergence of new downscaling techniques has greatly increased the volume of climate information available for impact assessments. It is generally desirable to include a wide range of climate change projections to quantify uncertainty; logical and practical constraints frequently dictate a more parsimonious approach, however. For many studies, effectively and efficiently navigating the trade-off between rigorously addressing uncertainty and reducing redundant information is an intractable challenge. Moreover, each successive generation of climate modeling efforts and downscaling approaches has resulted in a new and unique method of data archiving, thereby adding technical sophistication to the list of challenges faced by those seeking to use the information.</p>
