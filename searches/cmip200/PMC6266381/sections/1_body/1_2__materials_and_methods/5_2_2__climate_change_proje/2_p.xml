<p class="p">In response, EPA has developed a tool that can provide some assistance in addressing these issues. LASSO [
 <xref rid="B40-ijerph-15-02438" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>] automates the construction of a simple heuristic device—a scatterplot—to simplify the process of identifying the most useful subset of climate projections. Similar two-dimensional approaches have appeared in previous studies [

 <xref rid="B59-ijerph-15-02438" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>]. For this paper, we use LASSO to select an illustrative subset of climate model outputs downscaled using the recently developed localized constructed analogs (LOCA) downscaling approach.
