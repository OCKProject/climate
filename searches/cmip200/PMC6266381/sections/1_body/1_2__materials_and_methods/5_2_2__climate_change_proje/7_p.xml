 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-02438-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref> confirms large differences in the intensity and spatial distribution of temperature change across climate models and emissions scenarios. We limit our analysis to the Mayâ€“September warm season during which virtually all heat-related health impacts would occur. As expected, the CCSM model projects an increased number of warm season days over most of the conterminous U.S. under RCP8.5 relative to RCP4.5.
