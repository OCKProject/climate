<p class="p">This temperature threshold represents the lower bound of the specific health impact function used for this study (see Selecting an effect coefficient below). Several of the studies reviewed by Sanderson et al. [
 <xref rid="B27-ijerph-15-02438" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>] used minimum or maximum temperature as the mortality variable and the health model used in this study used minimum temperature. By choosing a vertical axis for the LASSO scatterplot that describes changes in maximum daily temperature (i.e., &gt;35 °C), we could identify projections that inform our specific research question in a way consistent with the risk framing described earlier. That is, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-02438-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref> allows us to identify models that project increasing daily minimums and increasing daily maximums, instead of one or the other. Although we expect daily minimum and maximum temperatures to be highly correlated, certain models—perhaps even families of models—could be considered “warmer” depending on whether daily minimums or maximums are considered. The LASSO scatterplot allows us to quickly and transparently sort climate change projections using two equally informative metrics simultaneously.
