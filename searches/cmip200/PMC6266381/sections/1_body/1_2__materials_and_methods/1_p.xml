 <xref rid="B45-ijerph-15-02438" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>], informed by core principles of risk assessment and management drawn from multiple disciplines. This framing, however, has highlighted ways in which traditional approaches to assessing climate change impacts often fail to deliver the actionable information needed by decision-makers to choose appropriate management responses for the specific climate-related risks under their purview [

 <xref rid="B47-ijerph-15-02438" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. Weaver et al. [
 <xref rid="B43-ijerph-15-02438" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>] argue for a shift in the objectives and implementation of such assessments to support risk management more concretely. They suggest improvements in three areas in particular: (i) starting with a decision focus in the design of assessments and supporting technical studies; (ii) improving quantification of the key risks most relevant to decision-makersâ€™ needs; and (iii) presenting the resulting risk information strategically, to more effectively convey it to its end users.
