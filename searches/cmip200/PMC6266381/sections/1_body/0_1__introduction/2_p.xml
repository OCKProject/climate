<p class="p">Climate and health impact studies typically apply empirically estimated temperature-mortality relationships to scenarios of present and future climate. A recent systematic review article [
 <xref rid="B27-ijerph-15-02438" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>] found 63 studies which provided quantitative projections of future heat-related mortality; nearly half of which (28) included one or more US cities. Most of these studies used epidemiological methods to estimate heat-related mortality relationships based on local observations of mortality and weather variables (24 of 28 studies). Of the remaining studies, three used an existing concentration-response function [
