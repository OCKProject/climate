<p class="p">In this paper, we present a new modeling and analysis framework, built around the environmental Benefits Mapping and Analysis Programâ€”Community Edition (BenMAP, US Environmental Protection Agency, Durham, NC, USA) [
 <xref rid="B37-ijerph-15-02438" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>], for estimating future heat-related mortality. This new framework has the flexibility to integrate these factors within health risk assessments, as well as to provide the capability to sample across the uncertainties in these factors and drivers, to provide a more comprehensive and decision-relevant picture of the total health risk from climate-driven increases in extreme heat. We illustrate the potential of this framework by presenting an updated set of projected excess heat-related mortality estimates for the United States resulting from a range of plausible trajectories of 21st century climate change, and by assessing the sensitivity of these projections to modeling and methodological choices for: (i) climate-induced changes in future meteorological conditions; and (ii) changes in future population size and geographic distribution.
