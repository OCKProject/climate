 <xref rid="B40-ijerph-15-02438" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>] for the first time to systematically select the specific downscaled climate realizations we use. We combine these climate modeling results with new population projections from EPAâ€™s Integrated Climate and Land Use Scenarios (ICLUS) project [
