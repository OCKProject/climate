<p class="p">For the CCSM results, the higher greenhouse gas (GHG) scenario, RCP 8.5, resulted in higher mortality estimates—9632 premature deaths for the SSP5 higher population scenario; 6545 for the SSP2 lower population scenario—compared to the lower GHG scenario RCP 4.5 (4430 to 3004 premature deaths for the SSP5 and SSP2 population scenarios respectively). The more sensitive (with respect to GHG emissions) MIROC climate model produced higher mortality estimates than the CCSM climate model, with the MIROC premature mortality estimates reaching 16,043 and 10,842 deaths for the SSP5 and SSP2 population scenarios, respectively. As expected, the lower SSP2 population scenario yielded reduced mortality estimates compared to the SSP5 population scenario, regardless of GHG scenario or climate model used.</p>
