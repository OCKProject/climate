 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-02438-f007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref> shows the strong heterogeneity that we find in the regional results. The Northern Plains and the Northwest had virtually no increase in heat related mortality regardless of RCP, GCM, or population scenario. The Southeast region exhibited the greatest increase in heat-related mortality, contributing 25% or more to total US heat-related mortality across all scenarios.
