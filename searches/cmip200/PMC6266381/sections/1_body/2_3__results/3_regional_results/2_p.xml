<p class="p">Like our national estimates, the general pattern of SSP2 CCSM 4.5 resulting in the lowest heat-mortality estimates and SSP5 MIROC 8.5 resulting in the highest was observed in all regions. However, the Northeastâ€™s SSP5 CCSM 8.5 mortality estimate (green bar) exceeded the SSP2 MIROC estimate (yellow bar; also note that they are nearly the same in the Southern Great Plains), which differs from the other regions and from the national estimates.</p>
