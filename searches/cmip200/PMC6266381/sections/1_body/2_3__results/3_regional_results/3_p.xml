 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-02438-f008" class="xref">Figure 8</xref> illustrates the role of population in estimating heat-related mortality—a key insight that emerged from this evaluation—making clear that the choice of population projection matters greatly for projecting overall mortality. For the projections driven by the MIROC GCM, the difference between using the SSP5 and SSP2 population projection is over 1200 deaths annually in the Southwest and Northeast. The Southwest is a particularly fast-growing region under both population scenarios, and the trajectory of total population in the Northeast is substantially different depending on the population scenario. These regional population trends and patterns result from the combination of assumptions regarding immigration, domestic migration, and other demographic components used to drive ICLUS v2 projections. These results demonstrate the critical role of sub-national population projections as a tool for revealing uncertainty, generating scenarios and assessing vulnerability in the context of health impact studies.
