<p class="p">Despite the potentially strong sensitivity of estimated mortality to these factors and methodological choices, Sanderson et al. found that very few studies analyzed their impact and explored, to any significant degree, the risk space they define. For example, only four studies used data from two or more climate models driven by the same emissions scenarios, but those studies found large differences in projected mortality based on the climate model chosen. Sanderson et al. reported similar findings for several other of the major sources of uncertainty listed above, with only a small handful of studies exploring uncertainty from changes in population and demographics, or adaptation to warmer temperatures; but with those studies demonstrating that these sources of uncertainty were of the same order of importance as the choice of climate model.</p>
