<p class="p">This framework, consisting of a linked system of: (i) climate models; (ii) downscaling with LOCA; (iii) an efficient scenario selection tool; (iv) population scenarios; and (v) BenMAP, allows for systematic exploration of drivers and key uncertainties. We demonstrated the use of this framework, as described and illustrated with the mortality results above, with a preliminary evaluation of impacts associated with three of the major sources of uncertainty described in [
