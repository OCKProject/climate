<p class="p">This example is notable because mortality in the Northeast was comparable to that of other regions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-02438-f007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref>), even though the warmest models for the Northeast region were not included in our analysis, indicating that the Northeast region mortality projections we present here are likely conservative. Identifying models region-by-region clearly resolves this issue, but likely increases computational burdens substantially as the volume of requisite climate information increases.
