<p class="p">We reiterate that this study is largely meant to be a proof of concept, with foci of demonstrating a proposed framework and describing first-order estimates, rather than a comprehensive exploration of the full range of each critical uncertainty. As such, there are a few other factors which we did not address in our study. For example, we used only a single dose-response function in our analysis; one which produced substantially lower mortality estimates than four other functions in a previous study [

Our results should therefore be viewed as highly conservative, with the expectation that replicating this analysis with alternative dose-response functions would increase the estimates of heat-related mortality. The key point, however, is that BenMAP can facilitate future assessments of sensitivity across multiple dose-response functions, as well as facilitate scientific community engagement in contributing those alternative formulations to the BenMAP framework.
