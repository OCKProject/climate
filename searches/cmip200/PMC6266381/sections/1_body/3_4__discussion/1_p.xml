<p class="p">This study provides an updated set of projected excess heat-related mortality estimates for the United States resulting from a range of plausible trajectories of 21st century climate change (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-02438-f007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref>). These are new estimates, since they are based on the most recent suite of state-of-the-art emissions pathways (RCPs), GCMs (CMIP5 models), and downscaling methodologies (LOCA) as developed by the climate modeling community, and they thus represent new results compared to what has been published previously. These results show a substantial impact of projected future climate change on heat-related mortality, with many thousands of additional deaths nationally, as well as in major geographic regions of the country individually.
