<p class="p">Comparing estimated changes in climate-induced changes in temperature-related mortality reported here with those reported elsewhere in the literature is complicated by critical differences in methodological choices and input parameters. This assessment applies a health impact function and uses the BenMAP tool, thus following an analytical approach that is like other studies. Voorhees [
 <xref rid="B31-ijerph-15-02438" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>] and colleagues quantified the number of temperature-related premature deaths occurring mid-century, estimating between about 3700 and 27,000 premature deaths, depending on the temperature-response parameter employed and the approach used to model changes in daily temperature. That paper reported temperature-attributable premature deaths quantified using the ICLUS projected population scenarios that were as much as 125% larger than the central estimates estimated using the default BenMAP projected population that did not account for changes in future climate. Post et al. [
 <xref rid="B50-ijerph-15-02438" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>] estimated the number of climate-induced ozone-related premature deaths occurring mid-century. Broadly consistent with our findings, they found that the estimated ozone-related deaths were sensitive to the choice of climate model and, to a lesser extent, the approach to projecting future population counts.
