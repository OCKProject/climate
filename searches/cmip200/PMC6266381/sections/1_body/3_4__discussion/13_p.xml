 <xref rid="B71-ijerph-15-02438" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>]. Unfortunately, the empirical evidence on heat-related adaptation does not support confident quantification of its effectiveness, nor of which specific mechanisms—behavioral, physiological, public health interventions, access to air conditioning and health care, community measures—are responsible. Gaining a better understanding of adaptation/acclimatization is critical for both estimating future heat-related mortality and for guiding efforts to reduce heat effects. The uncertainty in future heat-related mortality associated with adaptation methods may be comparable to or even larger than the uncertainty associated with emissions scenarios and climate models [
