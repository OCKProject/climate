<p class="p">We also did not consider the role of the urban heat island effect (UHI) [
 <xref rid="B65-ijerph-15-02438" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>], which subjects urban populations to even greater heat-related health risks [
 <xref rid="B35-ijerph-15-02438" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. In fact, none of the studies in Sanderson et al. considered the impacts of urban land use changes [
 <xref rid="B27-ijerph-15-02438" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. Going forward, the use of ICLUS v2 within our integrated analytical framework can help address this, because it provides not only population and land-use projections, but also projections of impervious surface associated with urban development. This allows for an accounting of increased UHI effects resulting from population-driven land use changes and urban expansionâ€”as well as the potential effectiveness of adaptation strategies, such as cool roofs and urban greenery [
 <xref rid="B66-ijerph-15-02438" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>], another set of factors that we did not consider in this analysis.
