<p class="p">In general, even based on this preliminary uncertainty evaluation, uncertainties associated with both future population and future climate (both as determined by GCM and emissions trajectory) exert a large influence on heat-related mortality projectionsâ€”much larger than, for example, other sources of variation in these kinds of results, such as year-to-year variability in the occurrence of extreme heat events. They therefore cannot be ignored in assessments of heat-related mortality due to climate change.</p>
