<p class="p">For example, as described in the introduction, a recent systematic review of future heat-related mortality due to climate change [
 <xref rid="B27-ijerph-15-02438" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>] identified 28 studies that provided quantitative projections of future heat-related mortality for at least one U.S. city (out of 63 total studies globally). The authors identified several key sources of uncertainty, including:
