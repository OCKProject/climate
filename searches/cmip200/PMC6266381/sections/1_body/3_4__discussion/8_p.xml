<p class="p">While our analysis sought to identify a plausible upper bound of projected temperature change, consistent with the principles of risk-based framing, this effort was complicated by the necessary step of selecting a geographic boundary. Model selection in this study, while largely objective, was based on projections that were spatially averaged over the conterminous United States. The respective characterization of MIROC-ESM-CHEM and CCSM4 as high- and medium-sensitivity models holds true for most of the seven NCA regions (not shown), however alternative model selections would have been justified for the Northeast (
