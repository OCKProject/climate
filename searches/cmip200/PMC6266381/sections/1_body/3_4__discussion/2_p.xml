<p class="p">This study also has a larger purpose, however, in that it aims to provide a proof of concept in systematically evaluating the sensitivity of projected future heat-related mortality in the United States to the key driving factors and major sources of methodological uncertainty inherent in such calculations. The ability to carry out such systematic evaluations is ultimately aimed at improving the foundation for risk-based assessments of the human health impacts of climate change. This capability, and its implementation in practice, are urgently needed to support such risk assessments, because: (i) there are multiple sources of uncertainty with the potential to exert a first-order influence on estimates of future heat-related mortality; and (ii) there has been, to date, very little quantitative exploration of the impact of these uncertainties on published estimates.</p>
