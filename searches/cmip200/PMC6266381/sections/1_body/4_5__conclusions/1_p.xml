<p class="p">The new modeling and analytic framework presented in this paper has the potential to accelerate the development of scientific understanding regarding climate change and heat-related mortality effects. The linked system of downscaled climate model simulations, the LASSO climate scenario selection tool, the ICLUS population scenarios, and BenMAP, allows for the systematic exploration of the potential range of heat-related mortality risks and the range of uncertainties in key drivers of heat-health risks. Our results show that different combinations of methodological choices and modeling assumptions produce a wide range of projected future health impacts, particularly at regional scales, thus beginning to define the envelope of future risk with respect to greenhouse gas emission scenario, climate model, and population uncertainties. Additional simulations with the current system could further map this uncertainty space. Meanwhile, additional research on demographic change, the relationship of the UHI to heat-related mortality, how the heat-mortality relationship is changing through time and varies by geography, and the effectiveness of adaption measures is also needed. As increased knowledge of these factors becomes available, it can readily be incorporated into the framework and future assessments, a strength of our frameworkâ€™s reliance on community-based models and publicly available data. Taken together, all such improvements to the scientific foundations of future heat-health risk assessment can facilitate efforts by public health departments and communities to reduce heat-related mortality.</p>
