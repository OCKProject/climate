  <p class="p">Locating and Selecting Scenarios Online (LASSO) scatterplot used to select climate projections. Climate models are denoted with a number shown to the right of the figure. Subscripts indicate the realization number of individual projections, i.e., some climate models produced multiple simulations. For this study, MIROC-ESM-CHEM (32
   <sub class="sub">1</sub>) was chosen to represent the upper bound of potential temperature change. CCSM4 (6
   <sub class="sub">6</sub>) was selected because it provided a more moderate projection of change and has been used in other recent modeling studies.
