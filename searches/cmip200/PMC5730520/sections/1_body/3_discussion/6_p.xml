 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="d1" class="xref">Equation 1</xref>. By applying this equation, we are implicitly assuming that factors that play an important role in tick population establishment (i.e., host densities, mortality rates, leaf litter, precipitation extremes, etc.) are spatially and temporally homogeneous. A number of parameters in the 
 <italic class="italic">I. scapularis</italic> model used for this study have assumed values, and the influence of these values on model outcome has been explored in local and global sensitivity analyses (

 <xref rid="c36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ogden et al. 2014b</xref>). Empirical studies have, however, demonstrated that, in southeastern Canada, the threshold temperature conditions for

 </inline-formula> for 
 <italic class="italic">I. scapularis</italic>, obtained by model simulations using these values, are accurate (
 <xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gabriele-Rivet et al. 2015</xref>). Clearly though, two factors in addition to suitable temperature conditions must be present for 
 <italic class="italic">I. scapularis</italic> populations to persist: woodland habitat to provide habitat for hosts and refuges for the ticks from extremes of temperature and host (particularly deer) densities above thresholds for tick population persistence. The patchy occurrence of these factors is likely responsible for the patchy emergence of 
 <italic class="italic">I. scapularis</italic> at a local level in Canada (
 <xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gabriele-Rivet et al. 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Clow et al. 2016</xref>); however, at a national level, empirical data suggest that temperature conditions have been the main determinant of the rates and trajectories of 
 <italic class="italic">I. scapularis</italic> spread, even when accounting for alternative factors (
 <xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Leighton et al. 2012</xref>). There is no expectation that these other factors will be limiting in the future (
 <xref rid="c36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ogden et al. 2014b</xref>), but this cannot be ruled out. Further study is needed to monitor their effects. Our conclusions are based on the assumption that temperature is indeed the main limiting factor on northward expansion of the tick populations and will remain so in the future.
