<p class="p">The difference between 
 <italic class="italic">I. scapularis</italic> establishment and 
 <italic class="italic">B. burgdorferi</italic> transmission risk should be taken into account; the ticks themselves do not threaten public health in the absence of 
 <italic class="italic">B. burgdorferi</italic> and other tick-borne pathogens. To date, the establishment of 
 <italic class="italic">B. burgdorferi</italic> in Canada has occurred following that of 
 <italic class="italic">I. scapularis</italic>; however, the former lags several years behind the initial establishment of tick populations (

 <italic class="italic">B. burgdorferi</italic> establishment in Eastern Canada while a shorter, 3-year gap occurs in Central Canada (

 <italic class="italic">B. burgdorferi</italic> strains may be affected by climate change (
