<p class="p">Climate change projections made by RCP climate simulations were referenced at the Paris Climate Conference. Mitigation associated with RCP2.6 is the most likely of the four RCPs to reach the governments’ goal to limit warming to 2°C or 1.5°C, relative to preindustrial levels (

 </inline-formula> increases projected under all four RCP scenarios for the periods 2011 to 2040 and 2041 to 2070, relative to the historical period 1971 to 2000, were found to be statistically significant, the difference in the magnitude of these increases was statistically significant only between RCP8.5 and RCP6.0 (Figure S5). This suggests that mitigation that results in reductions in both emissions and climate warming towards the three lower RCP scenarios may result in public health benefits starting in the 2030s; However, these benefits would not be realized if current emissions continue, as represented by the RCP8.5 scenario (

For those living further north, mitigation efforts that reduce emissions from those simulated in RCP8.5 to those in RCP6.0 may have much greater impact on whether or not these populations become at risk from Lyme disease (
