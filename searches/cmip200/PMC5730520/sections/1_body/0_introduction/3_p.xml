<p class="p">To simulate the effect of temperature on tick population survival and seasonality, Ogden et al. (
 <xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>) developed a mechanistic 
 <italic class="italic">I. scapularis</italic> population model comprised of 12 mutually exclusive states, each one representing a specific state in the ticksâ€™ life cycle. The model was designed to simulate 
 <italic class="italic">I. scapularis</italic> populations in specific geographic regions. To accomplish this, temperature data were used to vary the duration that ticks remained resident in the egg-laying and engorged-tick state and to alter questing-tick activities. Several parameters, including interstadial development rates, host-finding rates, and mortality rates, were calibrated for each development stage of the population model. Empirical validation revealed that the model was able to closely replicate the seasonal activity patterns for all three tick instars that were observed in the field. Using this model with temperature input obtained from two climate models, the effect of projected future climate on the possible geographic range of 
 <italic class="italic">I. scapularis</italic> populations was explored under two different emissions scenarios. All the research was in agreement that northern expansion of the geographic range suitable for 
 <italic class="italic">I. scapularis</italic> establishment may take place under future climate conditions (
