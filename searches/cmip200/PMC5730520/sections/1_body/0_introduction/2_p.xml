 <xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>, 
 <xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006, 2008</xref>) raised the hypothesis that climate suitability, predominantly temperature, is a key determinant of the survival of 
 <italic class="italic">I. scapularis</italic> populations and consequently that a warming climate may be a key driver of the emergence of the tick in Canada. There are multiple ways in which climate may affect the survival of tick populations. First, climate factors such as temperature and humidity can affect host-seeking activity. Second, the development rate of ticks from one life stage to the next is highly dependent on temperature: the development rate is 0 at 0Â°C and becomes faster at higher temperatures (
