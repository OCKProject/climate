<p class="p">We also excluded from our analysis any area with an elevation greater than 500 meters based on the criteria of Diuk-Wasser et al. (
 <xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>). This work suggests that the presence of infected nymphs is closely associated with lower elevation, low vapor pressures deficit, and low seasonal temperature extremes. No infected nymphs were collected above 510 meters. This upper-elevation limit may well be due to temperature conditions being too cold at higher altitudes, although other habitat characteristics may also be unsuitable for ticks at higher altitudes. For this reason, and because the resolution of climate model output was too coarse to identify colder temperatures of the relatively few locations over 500 m in southeastern Canada, these areas were masked out.
