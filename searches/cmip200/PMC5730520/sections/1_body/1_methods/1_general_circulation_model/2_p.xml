<p class="p">The CMIP5 simulations include: present-day simulations, coupled-control simulations with alternate forcings, historical simulations (1850–2005), and projection simulations forced with different emission concentrations specified by several RCPs. Here we used the historical (1850–2005) and RCP simulations (2006–2100) with a daily temporal resolution.</p>
