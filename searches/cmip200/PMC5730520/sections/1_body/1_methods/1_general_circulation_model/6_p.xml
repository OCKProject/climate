 <xref rid="c57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">CMIP-WGCM-WGSIP (2011)</xref>, we used the NARR surface air temperature to estimate the bias of each GCM’s surface air temperature data at each grid point. We determined the monthly biases for the period 1979 to 2005, which were then removed from the daily temperature data for each model simulation at each grid point over our spatial domain. We have followed the common practice of the modeling community: using the grid size of the most coarse-resolution model in the ensemble to interpolate the rest of the GCMs (
