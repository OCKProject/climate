<p class="p">In this study, we used the temporal evolution of surface air temperature at daily resolution as generated by each climate model in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. Because initial conditions of each GCM are sampled from an arbitrary point in a control simulation, GCM simulated temperature outputs can contain biases. To improve our projections, we used the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) to remove the potential biases that result from the different initial conditions employed in the simulations of each climate model. The NARR is a long-term, dynamically consistent, high-resolution, high-frequency, atmospheric and land surface hydrology data set for the North American domain (
 <xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Mesinger et al. 2006</xref>). The NARR data set was generated by coupling the National Center for Environmental Prediction Eta Model and the Regional Data Assimilation System. This ensured that a range of observational data (temperature, precipitation, etc.) was incorporated in the reanalysis. At the lowest latitude, the grid resolution is roughly 0.3 degrees, or
