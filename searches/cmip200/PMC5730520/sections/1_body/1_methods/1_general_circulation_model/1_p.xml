<p class="p">We used a set of 13 coordinated climate models from the CMIP5 (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). All models included in the CMIP5 framework must complete a set of benchmark experiments. This allows the results from each model simulation to be compared with both observations and other model simulated projections (
 <xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">IPCC 2013</xref>). With these available experiments, the CMIP5 allows researchers to evaluate model reliability in simulating the recent past, to provide projections of future climate change, and to gain a greater understanding of the possible causes for intermodel differences (
