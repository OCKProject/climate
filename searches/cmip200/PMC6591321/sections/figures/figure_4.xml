  <p class="p">Mechanistic rationale and statistical justification of uncertainty reduction hypothesis. The parameters and structural forms are identical for MICE runs unlike in MME, which manifests as nearly identical IQR with 25
   <sup class="sup">th</sup> and 75
   <sup class="sup">th</sup> percentiles being statistically indistinguishable (p &gt; 0.05) for all latitudes for MICE (
   <bold class="bold">A</bold>) but not so for MME (
   <bold class="bold">B</bold>) when the percent of convective to total precipitation is examined over the CONUS. However, while the physics that are more directly controlled by the parameter choices may be identical, variability persists in the physics that is indirectly determined, such as temperature dependence of precipitation extremes, whether RL
   <sub class="sub">100</sub> (
   <bold class="bold">C</bold>) or 99.9 percentiles (
   <bold class="bold">D</bold>). Uncertainty reduces continuously via successive concatenations, as shown in (
   <bold class="bold">E</bold>) with no concatenation to full concatenation of all available MICE runs (randomly-selected concatenated time series are shown as illustrations when concatenation is between 1 and 27), both owing to large sample-sizes per estimate as evident from (
   <bold class="bold">E</bold>) and lesser number of estimates to reconcile as evident from the box plots of the upper and lower bounds of the RL
   <sub class="sub">100</sub> estimates from each of the 27 MICE runs versus the estimates from the fully concatenated time series (
   <bold class="bold">F</bold>).
