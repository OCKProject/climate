  <p class="p">Reducing the irreducible uncertainty for impact and adaptation relevant metrics. Uncertainty in Depth-Duration-Frequency (DDF) curves, which are in turn often used to guide the design, maintenance and operations of hydraulic infrastructure such as dams, levees and reservoirs, and for water resources planning, are reduced through MICE concatenations as seen for three US hydrometeorological regions (other six regions in SI: Fig. 
   <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>): Large uncertainties in MICE leads to overlaps confidence bounds of RL
   <sub class="sub">100</sub> and RL
   <sub class="sub">30</sub> estimates (
   <bold class="bold">A</bold>) while reduction of uncertainties (see Fig. 
   <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>) makes (
   <bold class="bold">B</bold>) the RL
   <sub class="sub">100</sub> significantly distinguishable from RL
   <sub class="sub">30</sub>. The reduction of irreducible RL-estimates leads to statistically significant delineation of adaptation-relevant DDF.
