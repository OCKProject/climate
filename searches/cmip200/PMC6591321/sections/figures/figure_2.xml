  <p class="p">Concatenating MICE, justifiable owing to identical physics, can reduce the so-called irreducible uncertainty. MICE (unlike MME) is assumed to be driven by identical physics, while extreme value theory (EVT) assumes IID of annual maxima, hence MICE can be concatenated to increase the sample size per estimate and reduce the number of estimates that need to be reconciled.
