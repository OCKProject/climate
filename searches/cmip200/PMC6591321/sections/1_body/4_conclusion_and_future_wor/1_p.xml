<p id="Par22" class="p">We have used a hypothesis-driven approach which (in essence) reduces what has been considered the irreducible uncertainty component in depth duration and frequency curves under internal climate variability. The approach can help manage the explosion of uncertainty from (one of contributors to) the ensemble multiplier effect. This is accomplished by exploiting each MICE-run as an additional sample-generator for the estimation of precipitation extremes statistics over a projection time-window rather than producing an estimate from each run which then needs to be reconciled. The proposed approach does not reduce the intrinsic climate variability (which may be indeed irreducible given the extreme sensitivity to initial conditions

 </sup>), but instead of looking at MICE merely as manifestations of irreducible uncertainty, finds a way to use MICE runs to reduce the uncertainty in the estimates, in this case for precipitation extreme under a changing climate. The uncertainty reduction happens for two mutually related and reinforcing reasons: first, instead of producing as many estimates as the number of initial condition ensembles, we produce just one estimate, and second, the one estimate is produced with a much larger sample than each of the individual estimates. The ability of our proposed approach to improve our understanding of precipitation extremes under climate change and correspondingly generate more credible adaptation-relevant metrics is demonstrated as has been done for current climate elsewhere

 </sup>. Furthermore, we provide a mechanistic justification of our hypothesis which forms the basis of this study while also pointing to the possible caveat. The irreducible uncertainty component and MICE simulations are likely to be considered more seriously by climate scientists and stakeholders in the future including in the upcoming IPCC AR6 and CMIP6, thus enhancing the implications of this work. The lessons learned from this work may be developed further for broader applications to extremes generated from nonlinear spatiotemporal dynamical systems across physical or biological sciences, engineering and social sciences. The lessons learned for precipitation extremes projections and the basic approach here may generalize to multiple climate variables and extremes as well as to more broadly to climate science understanding and adaptation-relevance.
