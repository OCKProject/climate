<p id="Par13" class="p">To understand the significance of difference between median and mean values in MME and MICE for each of the 9 regions and entire US (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>), we use Kruskal Wallis H-test (non-parametric) and 2-sided independent T test (parametric) at significance level of 0.05 to test whether average value of variability and return levels estimated from MME and MICE differ significantly in each region. We observe p-values «0.05 for IQR as well as values of 100-year return level for both mean and median values. Thus, we can reject the null hypothesis of equal averages form IQR and RL100. We use the period of 2005–2100 from RCP8.5 scenario. for both MME and MICE.
