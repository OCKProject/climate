<p id="Par17" class="p">To explore the scaling relationships between precipitation extremes and annual average surface temperature for MICE, we measure the changes in return levels (RL
 <sub class="sub">100</sub>/T) and heavy (99.9-percentile: P
 <sub class="sub">99.9</sub>) precipitation (P
 <sub class="sub">99.9</sub>/T). The 99.9th percentile of daily precipitation (mm/day) is computed for the periods of 2081–2100 and 1981–2000 is used a reference period to calculate interquartile range at each latitude band. We chose these specific time-periods to heavy precipitation events so that scaling relationships observed in MICE can be compared to those of MMEs reported by Gorman
