<p id="Par14" class="p">To illustrate the continuous change in statistics of extreme precipitation and contribution of natural variability in overall variability, we account for non-stationarity by using moving window of 30-years to estimate return levels from Multiple Initial Condition Ensembles as well as Multiple Model Ensembles (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>). To address the potential non-stationary effect, rather than using all temporal data to fit one GEV distribution, GEV parameters are estimated separately for 30-year moving windows. The 30-year size is selected as it is expected to smooth out the effects of most climate oscillators and also give more confidence for low frequency extremes. We notice that even with non-stationarity, MME variability dominates than that obtained from MICE across all time-horizons. However, values of 100-year return levels (RL-100) obtained from MME are significantly higher for entire CONUS as well as 9 regions under consideration.
