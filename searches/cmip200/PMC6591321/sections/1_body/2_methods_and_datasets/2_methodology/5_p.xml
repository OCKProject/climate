<p id="Par16" class="p">We explore the mechanistic justification behind the ability to concatenate MICE by measuring variability in the fraction of precipitation extremes generated from convective (versus large scale) processes across latitudinal bands. We use interdependent T-test to measure the statistical significance of average uncertainty bound at significance level of 0.05. Since, p &gt; 0.05, null hypothesis that mean values are significantly different cannot be rejected in the case of MICE. However, for MME, p ≪ 0.05 suggests that upper and lower bounds are significantly different. All significance tests are performed using
