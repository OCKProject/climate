<p id="Par15" class="p">Rather than focusing exclusively on daily precipitation, we also compute return levels for cumulative rainfall for the period of 1,2, 3,5,6, and 10 days. Thus, AMP series are computed to derive return level corresponding to 100-year and 30-year precipitation levels. These extreme rainfall estimates and corresponding 95% CI are illustrated in terms of Depth Duration Frequency (DDF) curves, which are commonly used in for design and management of hydraulic structures and critical infrastructure facilities.</p>
