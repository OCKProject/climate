 </sup>, which are intended to advance understanding of internal variability in changing climate. LENS was generated with the NCAR Community Earth System Model run at ∼1° horizontal resolution. The ensemble methodology branches multiple GCM simulations from a single CMIP-type transient Historical Simulation. These multiple realizations differ only in slight perturbations in the initial atmospheric conditions in 1920. Each ensemble member is then prescribed the transient historical forcing through the end of the CMIP5 historical period (2005), and the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP 8.5) transient forcing after 2005. For this study, we use large scale precipitation, convective precipitation and average annual surface temperature from each MICE to test and explore mechanistic plausibility of the hypothesis.
