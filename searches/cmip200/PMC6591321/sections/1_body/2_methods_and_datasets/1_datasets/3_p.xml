<p id="Par11" class="p">To compare the contribution of multiple model and multiple initial condition runs to variability in extremes, we use the outputs from 27 Model Ensembles (MMEs) from Climate Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) listed in Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref> and same number of initial conditions (MICE) [IC2-IC28] under 8.5 RCP transient forcing. Since, we are comparing the statistics of multiple model ensembles, we use same number of samples from each ensemble to avoid sampling bias. MICE data listed in Table
