<p id="Par10" class="p">To compare the estimation of extremes as obtained from LENS with observations, we use Climate Prediction Center (CPC) unified gauge-based analysis of Daily Precipitation at the resolution of 0.25 degrees. Observed precipitation is first interpolated to match the resolution of CESM LENS outputs. Since, simulations from climate modes require bias correction prior to use in the impact assessments, we bias correct the historical runs (from the period of (1948â€“2005) of Multiple Initial Condition Ensembles (MICE) using quantile mapping
