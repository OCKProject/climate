 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> explores the mechanistic justification behind the insights in Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>. The rationale for our hypothesis about the ability to concatenate MICE was based on the notion that – unlike MME – the fundamental physics (including parametric and structural selections) and hence the data-generation process remains identical across MICE. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> shows that the variability in the fraction of the precipitation extremes generated from convective (versus large scale) processes across latitudinal bands are nearly identical (statistically indistinguishable from zero: See Methods) across MICE ensembles but significant across MME ensembles. This shows that the directly controllable physics and parameters in the MICE runs are nearly identical unlike in the MME runs. When the temperature dependence of changes in return levels (ΔRL
 <sub class="sub">100</sub>/ΔT) or heavy (99-percentile: P
 <sub class="sub">99.9</sub>) precipitation (ΔP
 <sub class="sub">99.9</sub>/ΔT) are computed, the variability in MICE ensembles are not dissimilar to the corresponding MME-variability reported in the literature. This suggests that the physics that is an indirect result of the parameter choices (rather than being directly controllable) may still exhibit variability, possibly owing to how the differences in MICE initializations may end up manifesting through the modeling system (e.g., as an analogy, the impact of initialization on a simulated low-frequency climate oscillator is shown in the online supplement of
