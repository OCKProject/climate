 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> based on DDF curves and their uncertainty bounds across the US hydrometeorological zones. Specifically, while the computed RL
 <sub class="sub">100</sub> and RL
 <sub class="sub">30</sub> and the corresponding DDF curves are not statistically distinguishable from each other when MICE members are considered individually, the concatenated MICE make the uncertainty bounds significantly narrower around each return level estimate and the DDF curves statistically significantly distinguishable from each other. It is noted that similar improvement in risk estimates of the chance of unprecedented rainfall was reported in Thompson

 </sup>. In present case, we report the reduced uncertainty for US hydrometereological zones in terms of engineering design and infrastructure management relevant intensity duration and frequency curves.
