 <sub class="sub">100</sub> over the 21st-century within the Continental United States (CONUS) between MME (27-member model ensembles from CMIP5; 
 <italic class="italic">See</italic> SI) versus MICE (27-member ensembles from NCAR LENS). While the variability across MICE is statistically significantly less than that across MME, ignoring MICE variability can result in significant underestimation of RL
 <sub class="sub">100</sub> for the US overall and across the nine hydrometeorological zones. The adaptation-relevance is shown by plotting the Depth-Duration-Frequency (DDF) which informs water resources and hydraulic infrastructures management. While the implication of ignoring DDF are evident across the CONUS, in certain zones such as the US Northeast RL
 <sub class="sub">100</sub> levels may be underestimate to RL
 <sub class="sub">30</sub> unless MICE are considered. We note that MICE variability here is based on one model only, thus the underestimation may be even more significant once and if MICE become available across models.
