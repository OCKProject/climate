<p id="Par5" class="p">The nature of the irreducible climate uncertainty and the potential explosion of model runs (i.e., MICE generated from multiple models with multiple emissions scenarios) leads to a set of research questions that animates our work here. Specifically, here we examine, first, how fundamental is a comprehensive characterization of ICV to our understanding of hydroclimate science and how relevant is it for informing stakeholders interested in adaptation or policy Second, we need to understand if a strategy demonstrated in Thomson

 </sup>, in the context current climate scenarios can be used to make sense of the larger number of GCM model ensembles that will become available, especially MICE runs in the context of ICV. Hence, The premise of our analysis rests on a simple hypothesis used in

 </sup>, which can simultaneously mitigate the ensemble multiplier effect for ICV while constraining uncertainty in return period curves, in this case for precipitation extremes. In the context of precipitation extremes under internal variability, multiple initial condition ensembles (MICE) from a given model essentially encapsulate the same physics including identical structural and parametric forms, the simulations provide different plausible versions of the real world.
