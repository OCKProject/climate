<p id="Par7" class="p">These considerations can be rather useful for estimates based on extreme value theory (EVT) such as the (

  <italic class="italic">T</italic>

 <sup class="sup">âˆ’1</sup> in any given year, since data are limited for extremes and estimation uncertainties can be reduced with additional data. Thus, one way to estimate the 
 <italic class="italic">T-year return level</italic> (RL
 <sub class="sub">T</sub>) of precipitation extremes (methods in

 </sup>) from time series of precipitation is to extract high values (specifically, annual maxima) which may be assumed to be IID (as assumption that needs to be tested for statistical significance), then fitting EVT distributions (e.g., Generalized Extreme Values [GEV]) to these values, and finally inferring extreme value properties (e.g., 100-year return levels, or RL
 <sub class="sub">100</sub>) from the parameters of the fitted distributions

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>
 </sup>. If our hypothesis about identical data generation process across MICE ensembles is true and hence the consequences in the estimation processes as discussed above are valid, then uncertainty in the estimates of RL
 <sub class="sub">100</sub> can be reduced by concatenation of the MICE time series.
