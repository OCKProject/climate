<p id="Par8" class="p">One aspect of the above is that instead of having to view MICE as contributors to the explosion of uncertainties owing to the ensemble multiplier effect (RCP ensembles times MME times MICE), they can be viewed as generators of additional samples which will likely reduce the uncertainties in our estimates. This is especially valuable for extremes analysis since sample size is relatively even more critical to estimation uncertainties given the rarity of the extremes

 </sup>. Furthermore, unlike in certain situations where the plausible futures projected by each ensemble member may be useful to consider for adaptation, in the case of precipitation extremes it is statistics such as RL
