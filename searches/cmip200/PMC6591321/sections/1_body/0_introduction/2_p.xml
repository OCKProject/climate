<p id="Par3" class="p">This lack of clarity is exacerbated by internal climate variability (ICV), which is in turn manifested through multiple initial condition ensembles (MICE). Projections from global climate or earth system models (ESM) suffer from three broad class of uncertainties: (a) knowledge gaps in how coupled human and natural systems may lead to greenhouse-gas emissions scenarios as captured through representative concentration pathways (RCP) which drive the ESMs, (b) lack of understanding of the physics and biogeochemistry of the climate and earth system the variability of which is encapsulated through structural and parametric differences in multiple model ensembles (MME), and (c) the intrinsic variability of the climate system which is captured as extreme sensitivity to initial conditions through MICE, which in turn are developed for a specific RCP and a specific model within the MME. While RCP variability is based on emissions and hence controllable by humans and treated as what-if scenarios for policy, MME have been handled statistically ranging through methods ranging from simple model weighing strategies to skill-based selection that may attempt to balance historical skills when compared with observations with future consensus among models as well as with the goodness of the embedded science understanding. However, ICV correspond to what has been called
