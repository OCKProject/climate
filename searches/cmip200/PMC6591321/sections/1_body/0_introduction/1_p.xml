 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>
 </sup> based on a 1940–2009 global land-based database of annual precipitation found little or no change in around 76% of the global land surface, while another

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>
 </sup> found support for the physical arguments that the seasonality of US daily heavy precipitation trends from 1979–2013 are linked more to internal decadal ocean variability than anthropogenic climate change. Conversely, one article
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>
 </sup> found that compared to 1950–1999, anthropogenic changes in precipitation means are already extractable in 2000–2009 in 36–41% of the globe, increasing to 68–75% in 2050 and 86–88% in 2100, while another

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>
 </sup> detected and attributed the influence of global warming on heavy precipitation in 41% of the observed areas across the globe, and a third article
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">7</xref>
 </sup> found statistically significant increasing trends precipitation extremes in about two-thirds of stations across the globe and a statistically significant association with globally averaged near surface temperature at a rate between 5.9% and 7.7% per Kelvin. While it is certainly possible that each study is accurate based on the specific choice of precipitation extremes metric(s), dataset(s) and analysis method(s) of choice, the overall picture remains unclear.
