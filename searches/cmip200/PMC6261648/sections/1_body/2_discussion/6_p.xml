<p class="p">In light of embryonic intolerance to OWA, we show that with unabated greenhouse gas emissions, large areas presently used for spawning will become less suitable for recruitment of Atlantic cod and Polar cod, possibly leading to cascading impacts on Arctic food webs and associated ecosystem services (
