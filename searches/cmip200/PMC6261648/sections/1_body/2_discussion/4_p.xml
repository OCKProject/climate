<p class="p">Second, our results assume that embryonic tolerance ranges are constant across different populations and generations (i.e., no evolutionary change within this century). These assumptions are supported by experimental data [e.g., similar temperature optima for egg development among different Atlantic cod populations (

  <italic class="italic">26</italic>
 </xref>); see also fig. S1], as well as by field observations [e.g., consistent northward shift of cod spawning activity in response to previous/ongoing warming (

  <italic class="italic">17</italic>
 </xref>)] and phylogenetic analyses of thermal tolerance evolution in marine fish [e.g., &lt;0.1Â°C change in thermal tolerance per 1 million years (
 <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">27</italic>
 </xref>)]. Transgenerational plasticity (TGP) may promote short-term adaptation to environmental change via nongenetic inheritance (e.g., maternal transmission) (

  <italic class="italic">23</italic>
 </xref>). However, in contrast to the theory of TGP, experiments on Atlantic cod suggest that egg viability is impaired during similar degrees of warming if females are heat exposed during gonad maturation (

  <italic class="italic">28</italic>
 </xref>). This example of negative TGP corresponds with the majority (57%) of studies on TGP in fish that observed either neutral (33%) or negative (24%) responses (

  <italic class="italic">29</italic>
 </xref>). Given the limited capacity for short-term adaptation, it is most likely that species have to abandon their traditional habitats as soon as physiological limits are exceeded (

 </xref>). Accordingly, our results identify not only high-risk areas but also potential refuge habitats that should receive priority with respect to the implementation of marine reserves.
