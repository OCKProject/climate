<p class="p">Our projections suggest that OWA-driven impacts on egg survival and consequent changes in spawning habitat suitability may be primary determinants of climate-dependent constraints on Atlantic cod and Polar cod. Present findings are in line with the hypothesis that tolerance thermal ranges and embryonic habitats of both species are compressed by progressive OWA (

 </xref>), although we identified some cold refugia for this species in the High Arctic. Atlantic cod may follow the poleward displacement of its thermal optimum, possibly leading to the establishment of this commercially important species in regions that are currently dominated by Polar cod. The parallel decrease in habitat suitability off Iceland and the Norwegian coast (under RCP8.5) implies that, by 2100, spawning south of the Arctic Circle (e.g., south of the Lofoten) may no longer be possible for Atlantic cod. Potential displacements of commercially important fish stocks across management boundaries and exclusive economic zones pose major challenges not only to national fishermen and conservationist (
