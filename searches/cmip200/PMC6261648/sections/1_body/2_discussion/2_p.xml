<p class="p">However, if global warming is limited to 1.5Â°C above preindustrial levels, then changes in thermal suitability of present spawning habitats are unlikely to exceed critical thresholds of Atlantic cod and Polar cod. Residual risks may be reduced further as both species can potentially adapt to climatic changes, by responding either (i) via shifts in the timing and/or location of spawning within present regions (
