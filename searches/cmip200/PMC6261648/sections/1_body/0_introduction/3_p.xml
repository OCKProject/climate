<p class="p">Both Atlantic cod and Polar cod are key members of the Northern high-latitude fish fauna, but they differ in terms of thermal affinity and spawning preference (

 </xref>, 
 <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">

 </xref>). Atlantic cod is a “thermal generalist” that occupies temperate to Arctic waters between −1.5° and 20°C (

  <italic class="italic">12</italic>
 </xref>). In contrast, Polar cod is a “thermal specialist,” endemic to the High Arctic and is rarely found at temperatures above 3°C (
 <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">13</italic>
 </xref>). Because of overlapping temperature ranges of juvenile and adult life stages, both species coexist during their summer feeding migrations (

  <italic class="italic">14</italic>
 </xref>). During winter and spring, however, spawning occurs in separate locations with different water temperatures and sea-ice conditions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>). Given that Atlantic cod prefers warmer waters (3° to 7°C) than Polar cod (−1° to 2°C), the latter species is considered to be particularly vulnerable to climate change (

 </xref>, 
 <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">14</italic>
 </xref>). Moreover, another indirect threat to Polar cod reproduction is the projected loss of sea ice, which serves as nursery habitat for larvae and juveniles during spring and summer (
