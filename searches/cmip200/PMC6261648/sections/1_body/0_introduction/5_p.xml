Spawning habitat suitability was mapped across the Seas of Norden under different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) by linking egg survival data with climate simulations of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). RCPs assume either “no greenhouse gas mitigation” (RCP8.5), “intermediate mitigation” (RCP4.5), or “strong mitigation” (RCP2.6). The latter scenario was developed with the goal of limiting the increase in global mean surface temperature (averaged over land and sea surface) to below 2°C relative to the reference period 1850–1900 and is suitable for providing a first estimate for the consequences of keeping global warming to “well below 2°C, if not 1.5°C,” as stated in the Paris Agreement (
