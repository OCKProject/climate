<p class="p">The Subarctic and Arctic seas around Northern Europe (i.e., Iceland Sea, Norwegian Sea, East Greenland Sea, and Barents Sea) are projected to experience higher rates of ocean warming, acidification, and sea-ice loss than most other marine areas on Earth (
 <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">6</italic>
 </xref>). These ocean regions—previously termed the Seas of Norden (
 <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">7</italic>
 </xref>)—are inhabited by highly productive fish populations, most of which undertake annual migrations to specific spawning locations (
 <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">4</italic>
 </xref>). The biophysical features of suitable spawning habitats support the survival of early-life stages as well as their dispersal toward suitable nursery areas (

  <italic class="italic">8</italic>
 </xref>). Given that fish embryos are often more sensitive to environmental change than subsequent life stages (
 <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">2</italic>
 </xref>), embryonic tolerance may act as a fundamental constraint on spawning habitat suitability. For example, thermal tolerance ranges that are narrower in fish embryos than in other life stages may represent a biogeographic constraint (

 </xref>) and are likely explained by incomplete development of cardiovascular and other homeostatic systems (
 <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">9</italic>
 </xref>). Ocean acidification (OA) caused by elevated aquatic CO

 <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">10</italic>
 </xref>), thereby narrowing the thermal range (
