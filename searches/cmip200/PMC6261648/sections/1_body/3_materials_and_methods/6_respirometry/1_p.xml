S4) were measured in closed, temperature-controlled respiration chambers (OXY0 41 A, Collotec Meßtechnik GmbH, Germany). The double-walled chambers were connected to a flow-through thermostat to adjust the temperature of the respiration chamber to the corresponding incubation temperature of the eggs. Measurements were conducted in triplicate with 10 to 20 eggs of each female and treatment combination. Eggs were placed into the chamber with a volume of 1 ml of sterilized seawater adjusted to the corresponding

The change in oxygen saturation was detected by micro-optodes (fiber-optic microsensor, flat broken tip, diameter: 140 μm, PreSens GmbH, Germany) connected to a Microx TX3 (PreSens GmbH, Germany). Recordings were stopped as soon as the oxygen saturation declined below 80% air saturation. Subsequently, the water volume of the respiration chamber and wet weight of the measured eggs (g
