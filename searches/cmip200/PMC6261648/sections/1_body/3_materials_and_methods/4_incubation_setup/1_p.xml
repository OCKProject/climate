Each treatment group of an egg batch was subdivided into two stagnant incubators (20 incubators per female, 120 in each experiment). To not bias survival estimates, only one of the two incubators was used to evaluate egg survival (and larval morphometrics at hatch), while subsamples required for embryonic
