<p class="p">Generalized additive models [package “mgcv” (
 <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">39</italic>

 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. This method has the benefit of avoiding a priori assumptions about the shape of the performance curve, which is crucial in assessing the impact of elevated

 <italic class="italic">M</italic>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> data, respectively. To avoid overfitting, the complexity of the curve (i.e., the number of degrees of freedom) was determined by penalized regression splines and generalized cross-validation (

  <italic class="italic">39</italic>
 </xref>). Models of egg survival were constrained at thermal minima because eggs of cold-water fish can survive subzero temperatures far below any applicable in rearing practice. Following Niehaus 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. (
 <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">40</italic>
 </xref>), we forced each model with artificial zero values (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 6) based on absolute cold limits from the literature. These limits were set to −4°C for Atlantic cod (
 <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">41</italic>
 </xref>) and −9°C for Polar cod assuming similar freezing resistance, as reported for another ice-associated fish species from Antarctica (
