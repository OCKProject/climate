<p class="p">Atlantic cod were caught by longlining in the southern Barents Sea (Tromsøflaket: 70°28′00″N, 18°00′00″E) in March 2014. Mature fish were transported to the Centre for Marine Aquaculture (Nofima AS, Tromsø, Norway) and held in a flow-through tank (25 m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>) under ambient light, salinity [34 practical salinity units (PSU)], and temperature conditions (5° ± 0.5°C). Polar cod were caught in Kongsfjorden (West Svalbard: 78°95′02″N, 11°99′84″E) by trawling in January 2014. Selected fish were held in flow-through tanks (0.5 m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>) and transferred to the Aquaculture Research Station in Karvikå (NOFIMA, The Arctic University of Norway UiT, Tromsø). At the station, the fish were kept in a flow-through tank (2 m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>) at 3° ± 0.3°C water temperature (34 PSU) and complete darkness. In both experiments, gametes used for in vitro fertilizations were obtained by strip spawning from
