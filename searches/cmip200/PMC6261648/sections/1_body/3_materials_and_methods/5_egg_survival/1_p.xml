<p class="p">Egg mortality was recorded on a 24-hour basis until all individuals within an incubator had either died or hatched (fig. S4). Once hatching commenced, free-swimming larvae were collected in the morning, euthanized with an overdose of tricaine methanesulfonate (MS-222), and counted after visual examination for morphological deformities under a stereomicroscope. The incidence of larval deformities was quantified as the percentage of hatchlings exhibiting severe deformations of the yolk sac, cranium, or vertebral column. Egg survival was defined as the percentage of nonmalformed, viable larvae that hatched from the initial number of fertilized eggs (fig. S5). The proportion of fertilized eggs within an incubator was estimated from the mean fertilization success of the respective egg batch (table S3).</p>
