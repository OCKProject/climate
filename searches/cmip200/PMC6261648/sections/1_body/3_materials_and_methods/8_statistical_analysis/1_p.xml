<p class="p">Statistics were conducted with the open source software R, version 3.3.3 (

 <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">37</italic>
 </xref>)] were used to analyze data on egg survival and

 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. In each case, we treated different levels of temperature and 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>
 <sc class="sc">co</sc>
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> as fixed factors and included “female” (egg batch) as a random effect. Differences in larval morphometrics (yolk-free body area, total body area, dry weight, standard length, and yolk sac area) were determined by multifactorial analysis of covariance. These models were run with temperature and 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>
 <sc class="sc">co</sc>
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> as fixed factors and egg diameter as a covariate. Levene’s and Shapiro-Wilk methods confirmed normality and homoscedasticity, respectively. The package “lsmeans” (
 <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">38</italic>
 </xref>) was used for pairwise comparisons (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> values were adjusted according to Tukey’s post hoc test method). All data are presented as means (± SEM) and statistical tests with 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05 were considered significant. Results are summarized in table S1.
