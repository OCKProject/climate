<p class="p">Fitted treatment effects on normalized egg survival data (fig. S6A; raw data are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>) were linked to climate projections for the Seas of Norden to infer spatially explicit changes in the maximum PES under different RCPs. That is, the treatment fits were evaluated for gridded upper-ocean water temperatures (monthly averages) bilinearly interpolated to a horizontal resolution of 1° × 1° and a vertical resolution of 10 m. To account for species-specific reproduction behavior, we first constrained each map according to spawning seasonality and depth preferences reported for Atlantic cod [March to May, 50 to 400 m (

 </xref>)] and Polar cod [December to March, 5 to 400 m (
 <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">13</italic>
 </xref>)]. As both species produce pelagic eggs that immediately ascend into the upper mixed layer if spawned at greater depths (

  <italic class="italic">13</italic>
 </xref>, 
 <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">33</italic>
 </xref>), we further limited the eligible depth range to the upper 50 m. PES at a given latitude and longitude was then estimated from the calculations by selecting the value at the depth of maximum egg survival (at 0 to 50 m depth). Egg dispersal was not considered since the major bulk of temperature- and acidification-related mortality occurs during the first week of development (fig. S4).
