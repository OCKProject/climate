<p class="p">Compared with contemporary (known) spawning sites of Atlantic cod and Polar cod in the study area (blue areas in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>; yellow dashed areas in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>), our baseline simulations (1985â€“2004) suggest that spawning occurs exclusively within the thermal optimum range of embryo development [&gt;90% potential egg survival (PES), 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>]. However, the area of thermally suitable spawning habitat (PES &gt;90%) is larger than the area where spawning actually occurs. For example, despite suitable temperatures, no spawning of Atlantic cod is currently observed in the northeastern Barents Sea (

 </xref>), indicating that spawning habitat suitability also depends on factors other than temperature. Mechanisms that preclude certain areas as suitable for spawning may include aberrant dispersal of eggs and larvae, unfavorable feeding conditions, and predation pressure (
