<p class="p">By 2100, unabated OWA (RCP8.5) is projected to cause a substantial decline in PES at major spawning sites of both species (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>, A to C). For Atlantic cod, PES is projected to decrease around Iceland (−10 to −40%) and the Faroe Islands (−20 to −60%) and along the entire Norwegian coast (−20 to −60%), including the most important spawning sites at the Lofoten archipelago (at 68°N, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">Fig. 5A</xref>). In turn, extensive shelf regions off Svalbard and across the northeastern Barents Sea will become more suitable (PES, +10 to +60%) due to warming and decreasing sea-ice cover. However, potential habitat gains in the North are constrained by reduced cold tolerance of Atlantic cod embryos under OA conditions and, possibly, unknown constraining factors (see above). Under RCP4.5, decrements in PES of Atlantic cod at some southern spawning sites (e.g., Faroe Islands: −10 to −40%) are largely outweighed by thermal benefits (PES, +20 to +60%) in the northeastern Barents Sea (between Svalbard, Franz Josef Land, and Novaya Zemlya;
