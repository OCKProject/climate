<p class="p">Polar cod will likely experience the most dramatic losses of spawning habitat south of Svalbard and Novaya Zemlya (PES, −40 to −80%; RCP8.5; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">Fig. 5B</xref>). Moreover, Polar cod is going to lose most of its under-ice habitats except for a small refuge on the East Greenland shelf (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">Fig. 5B</xref>). Even warming without OA effects (RCP4.5; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>, E and F) will substantially reduce the suitability of important spawning habitats for Polar cod off Svalbard (PES, −20 to −60%) and Novaya Zemlya (PES, −10 to −40%). The widespread loss of sea ice under RCP8.5 and RCP4.5 scenarios may indirectly affect the reproductive success of Polar cod, because the ice protects spawning adults from predation and serves as a feeding habitat for early-life stages (

 </xref>). Limiting global warming to about 1.5°C above preindustrial levels (that is, the median temperature of RCP2.6) may not only minimize reductions in PES at the present core spawning areas of both species to less than 10% (
