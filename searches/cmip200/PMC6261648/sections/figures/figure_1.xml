  <p class="p">(
   <bold class="bold">A</bold>) Atlantic cod; (
   <bold class="bold">B</bold>) Polar cod. Populations of both species reproduce during winter and spring (Atlantic cod: March to May; Polar cod: December to March) at species-specific locations (i.e., spawning habitats, blue-shaded areas) with characteristic temperature and sea-ice conditions (Atlantic cod: 3° to 7°C, open water; Polar cod: −1° to 2°C, closed sea-ice cover). Green arrows indicate egg and larval dispersal driven by prevailing surface currents. During summer, the feeding grounds (green-shaded areas) of both species partly overlap, for example, around Svalbard, which marks the northernmost distribution limit of Atlantic cod. Red symbols denote the origin of animals (spawning adults) used in this study. Distribution maps were redrawn after (
