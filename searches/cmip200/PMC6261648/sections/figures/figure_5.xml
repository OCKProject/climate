   <bold class="bold">I</bold>) RCP2.6: Less than 2°C global warming (no acidification considered). Maps show the shift in PES between the baseline period (1985–2004; spawning season of Atlantic cod: March to May; spawning season of Polar cod: December to March; see 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>) and the median of CMIP5 multimodel-based projections (seasonal sea surface temperature, 0 to 50 m; see Materials and Methods) for this century’s end (2081–2100). Black shading indicates areas (cells, 1° × 1°) with high uncertainty (that is, the shift in PES within that cell is smaller than the CMIP5 ensemble spread; see Materials and Methods). Dotted magenta lines represent the sea-ice edge positions of the respective species-specific spawning season (defined as areas with ice concentrations &gt; 70%). (C, F, and I) For each map, values (change in PES) of individual cells are summarized by kernel density estimations, with the width corresponding to the relative occurrence of values. Box plots show the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile; the ends of the whiskers mark the 95% intervals.
