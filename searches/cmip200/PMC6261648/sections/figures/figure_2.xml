   <sub class="sub">2</sub> was measured in eyed-stage embryos (image). Symbols are means (±SEM depicted as bars, 
   <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 6 or 4). Performance curves (lines) are based on 
   <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 28 data points. Dark and light shadings indicate 90 and 95% Bayesian credible confidence intervals, respectively. (
   <bold class="bold">C</bold> and 
   <bold class="bold">D</bold>) Larval yolk-free body area at hatch was assessed as an indicator of somatic growth and resource (yolk) utilization. Box plots overlaid with individual values show the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile; whiskers mark 95% confidence intervals. (D) Sufficient sample sizes were not available at 6°C because most individuals died or hatched malformed. (
   <bold class="bold">E</bold> and 
   <bold class="bold">F</bold>) Offsets between regression lines (with 95% confidence intervals) indicate CO
   <sub class="sub">2</sub>-related differences in size-weight relationships of newly hatched larvae (image). Individuals were pooled across temperature treatments (E: 0° to 12°C, F: 0° to 3°C). (A to F) Significant main effects of temperature,
