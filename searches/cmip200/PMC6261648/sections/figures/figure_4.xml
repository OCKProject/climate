   <bold class="bold">B</bold>) Polar cod. Spawning habitat suitability is expressed as PES (%PES, color coded) by combining experimental survival data (
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>) with WOA13 temperature fields (1° × 1°, upper 50 m of shelf seas) for the baseline period 1984–2005. Values are averaged over spawning seasons (Atlantic cod: March to May; Polar cod: December to March) and referenced against locations where spawning has been documented [yellow dashed areas (

   </xref>, 
   <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">

   </xref>)]. The spatial extent of thermally suitable spawning habitat (PES &gt; 90%) is typically larger than the “realized spawning habitat” because other limiting factors are not considered. Dotted magenta lines indicate the respective seasonal sea-ice edge positions (defined as areas with ice concentrations &gt; 70%; note that sea-ice edge various slightly between species due to varying species-specific spawning seasons).
