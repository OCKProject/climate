 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Fig. 4B</xref>) associated with the oceanic stratus cloud decks west of Southern Africa and North and South America and with the cloud systems in the intertropical convergence zone. High-altitude clouds can reduce the solar flux incident on methane in the lower troposphere and, hence, reduce its forcing relative to clear-sky conditions, but over 88% of Earthâ€™s surface, cloud radiative effects act to enhance the methane radiative forcing by up to 2.75 times the global annualized forcing (
