<p class="p">Second, we investigate whether, in principle, the methane shortwave forcing would change given a comprehensive tabulation of all the major absorption features spanning the Sun’s visible and near-infrared spectrum. To accomplish this task, we use an empirical parameterization of methane’s absorption optical depth as a function of wave number based on a synthesis of absorption data from observations of Jupiter and Titan (

 </xref>). The atmospheres of these Jovian planets and moons feature volume mixing ratios of methane that are at least three orders of magnitude greater than those on Earth (

  <italic class="italic">25</italic>
 </xref>). As a result, absorption features that are too weak to detect in a laboratory can be readily estimated from occultation measurements through Jovian atmospheres. On the basis of these observations, a parameterization of CH

 </xref>) and applied to Earth’s atmosphere (see Materials and Methods). The empirical parameterization of this absorption for Earth-like conditions is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref> and enables us to estimate an upper bound on methane radiative forcing from possible future additions to laboratory-based tabulations of its absorption lines. Our forcing calculations are summarized in

 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, where laboratory spectroscopic data are not yet available. These results confirm that the idealized RTMIP CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> forcings will likely remain stable to two significant figures under future updates to the spectroscopic databases. The addition of the Jovian spectrum does not significantly perturb CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> forcings due to the exceptionally low methane absorption optical depths in visible wavelengths (
