<p class="p">We examine the question of whether the shortwave forcing of CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> is affected by recent and/or future additions to our tabulations of its absorption band structure. First, we examine whether the new CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> absorption features that have appeared in the HITRAN spectroscopic database (

 <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">12</italic>
 </xref>), is periodically updated as new measurements and models of these spectra become available. As a result, the maximum wave number at which methane lines have been tabulated has increased almost linearly in time since 1982, while the number of lines has grown exponentially in time (fig. S1). Both HITRAN and GEISA currently include up through the eighth (pentacontakaipentad) polyad between 11,000 and 12,000 cm
