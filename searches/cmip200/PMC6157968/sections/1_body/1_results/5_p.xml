 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Figure 3A</xref> shows that large spatial gradients in shortwave CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> forcing are driven by corresponding gradients in low-latitude near-infrared surface albedo. Brighter surfaces such as the Sahara Desert and Arabian Peninsula increase photon path lengths in CH
