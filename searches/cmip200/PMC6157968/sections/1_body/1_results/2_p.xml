<p class="p">Here, we quantify how updates to the HITRAN 2000 edition alter the direct instantaneous shortwave forcing by CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>. We compute representative forcings by differencing radiative transfer calculations for two numerical experiments conducted under the Radiative Transfer Model Intercomparison Project (RTMIP) (

 <sub class="sub">4</sub> alter its forcing under the idealized RTMIP protocols by less than approximately 4%.
