 </inline-formula>, and we would therefore anticipate that the increments to the resulting forcings would also be one to two orders of magnitude smaller based on the single-scattering linear limit of the solution to the radiative transfer equations. This expectation is borne out by the full forcing calculations shown in fig. S4, which show perturbations at TOA and the tropopause of O(10
