<p class="p">The methods used in this study are based on three components: experimental protocols, tabulation of methane absorption spectra, and models that are all used in combination to calculate the shortwave direct radiative forcing by CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>. The calculations were designed to compute the direct and unadjusted shortwave forcing due to an increase in CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> concentrations from 806 to 1760 ppbv under idealized cloud- and aerosol-free clear-sky conditions.
