<p class="p">The protocols we adopted are identical to those for experiments 3b and 3d from the RTMIP (

 </xref>). Experiment 3b corresponds to present-day greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations in 2000 CE, while experiment 3d corresponds to a counterfactual atmosphere with CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>, CFC-11, and CFC-12 set to their concentrations in 1860 CE while other atmospheric properties are held at present-day climatological values. Since the methane concentrations in these two experiments are 1760 and 806 ppbv, respectively, differencing the radiative fluxes calculated for these experiments provides an estimate of the direct shortwave forcing by CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> between 2000 and 1860 CE. Following RTMIP, the upper boundary conditions are a TOA solar insolation (

  <italic class="italic">28</italic>
 </xref>) of 1360 W/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> and a solar zenith angle of 53Â°. The lower boundary condition is a Lambertian surface with a spectrally flat albedo of 0.1. The atmospheric thermodynamic conditions and water vapor and ozone mixing ratios correspond to the Air Force Geophysics Laboratory (AFGL) mid-latitude summer atmospheric profile (
