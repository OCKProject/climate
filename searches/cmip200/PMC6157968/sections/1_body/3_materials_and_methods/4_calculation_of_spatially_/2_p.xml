<p class="p">The OSSE framework ingests time-dependent two- and three-dimensional climate model outputs that, when combined with auxiliary initial and boundary conditions and other data sets, provide a complete prescription of the climate system state required to compute the vertically resolved radiation fields throughout the atmosphere at each model grid point and time interval. The computations were performed using the MODTRAN code version 5.3.0.0. The MODTRAN calculations were performed using the DISORT code (

 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> resolution over a spectral range of 2000 to 11,900 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. The spectral properties of radiative active gases in MODTRAN version 5.3.0.0 were obtained from HITRAN 2008 (

  <italic class="italic">47</italic>

  <italic class="italic">48</italic>
