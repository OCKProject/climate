 </xref>). The time resolution of the climate model output is monthly, and the time period selected for analysis here spans five full years from January 2006 through December 2010. The input fields are detailed in table S1. The calculations were performed at two globally uniform tropospheric CH

 <xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">59</italic>
 </xref>). For each of these concentrations, for each month, the fluxes were computed for globally uniform solar zenith angles specified by a standard seven-point Gauss-Legendre quadrature over 0° to 90° zenith angle. The weights in the quadrature formulae required to compute diurnally averaged fluxes at each model grid point are functions of month and latitude. These weights were computed from cumulative probability distributions of solar zenith angles constructed using calculations of the Sun-Earth viewing geometry at a 1-min frequency using the same solar ephemeris used in the Community Atmospheric Model version 3 (
