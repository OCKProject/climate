<p class="p">The radiative quantities computed by MODTRAN include the spectral and spectrally integrated fluxes under clear-sky and all-sky conditions at all levels in the input model fields. The fluxes are further separated into the downwelling direct, downward diffuse, and upwelling diffuse terms. The MODTRAN calculations for RTMIP differ with the LBL calculations using the HITRAN 2012 line database by âˆ’0.016 W/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> at the surface, +0.017 W/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> at the tropopause, and +0.003 W/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> at the top of model (TOM). For comparison, the SDs of the forcing among the LBL codes that participated in RTMIP are, to two decimal places, 0.02 W/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> at the surface, 0.00 W/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> at the tropopause, and 0.00 W/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> at the TOM. This demonstrated that the MODTRAN code is performing comparably to the much more computationally expensive LBL codes.
