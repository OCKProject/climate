<p class="p">When clouds are present in a model column, grid-point-mean fluxes are computed assuming maximum-random cloud overlap in the vertical direction by adopting the independent column approximation and generating a set of binary cloud configurations that aggregate to the original model profile of cloud amount (

 </xref>). Radiative transfer calculations were performed for each binary cloud configuration and combined in a sum weighted by the fractional areas occupied by each configuration within the grid cell (

 </xref>). When sea ice was present, the full set of clear-sky and all-sky calculations was repeated for 100% open-ocean and 100% sea iceâ€“covered conditions and then combined in a sum weighted by the fractional sea ice coverage. This approach accurately accounts for nonlinear effects of multiple scattering of sunlight between ice and overlying clouds.
