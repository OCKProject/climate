<p class="p">Quantification of radiative forcing by anthropogenic well-mixed greenhouse gases (WMGHGs) is required to detect and attribute the historical impacts of these agents on the climate since industrialization and to project their future impacts on Earthâ€™s system. The primary role of WMGHGs is to enhance the atmospheric greenhouse effect through absorption and re-emission of terrestrial infrared, or longwave, radiation (

 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>, and N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O is to absorb incoming solar radiation, thereby heating the atmosphere while simultaneously reducing the surface insolation (

 </xref>). The shortwave effects of methane have been omitted from the radiative forcing formulae used in past assessments by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (

 </xref>). While the forcing formulae have recently been updated to correct this omission (
 <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">3</italic>
 </xref>), those findings raise questions about whether estimates of the forcing by methane will continue to evolve and, if so, by how much. Any overlooked aspects of CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> absorption could lead to revised radiative forcing estimates with potentially significant ramifications for the relative prioritization both of scientific investigations and of mitigation strategies for anthropogenic WMGHGs.
