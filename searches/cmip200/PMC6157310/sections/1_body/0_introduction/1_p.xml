 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fixation, the largest source of fixed N to the ocean, maintains ocean fertility by compensating for N-losses via denitrification. Global warming, likely inducing ocean deoxygenation (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Keeling et al., 2010</xref>), and increasing N load from the atmosphere and/or rivers, are perturbing the N cycle leading to increasing N loss via denitrification on the one hand (

A prolonged mismatch between N inputs and losses would cause changes to the oceanic fixed N inventory, potentially affecting ocean productivity and ocean carbon (C) storage. Narrowing down the uncertainties in current N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fixation estimates is key to diagnosing any imbalance in the marine N budget and its effect on the marine C budget.
