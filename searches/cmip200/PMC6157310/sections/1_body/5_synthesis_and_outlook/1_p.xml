<p class="p">All approaches to constrain global rates of N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fixation (experimental, geochemical, and model-based estimates) have their own uncertainties and biases. Albeit the recent progress we still lack a comprehensive knowledge of the relevant environmental and ecological interactions, which prevent us from making robust N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fixation rates estimates and predictions. To reduce the current level of uncertainty an improved understanding of the players, their ecological interactions, and the factors that control N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fixation in the ocean must be drawn from a collective research effort. This requires to take novel approaches that go beyond assuming simple correlations/sensitivities, but rather consider a combination of environmental factors and emerging ecological interactions, both in the field and in the laboratory. To this end, identifying essential traits and ecological interactions experimentally, and develop mechanistic based models, may help us decipher the complexity of marine N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fixation and allow robust fixation estimates. As of now, the large uncertainties in existing N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fixation estimates and in the underlying feedbacks with N loss processes rule out reliable predictions. This task needs a fresh turn.
