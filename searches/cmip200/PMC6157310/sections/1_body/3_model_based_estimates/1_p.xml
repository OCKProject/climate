<p class="p">Global N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fixation estimates have been derived from models using both implicit (diagnostic) and explicit (prognostic) N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fixation parameterizations. Implicit N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fixation parameterizations used in some IPCC-type earth-system-models (ESM) are based on restoring-type approaches that simulate N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fixation by restoring upper-ocean nutrient ratios toward Redfield NO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>:PO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> stoichiometry (MPI-ESM, 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ilyina et al., 2013</xref>). This implies that N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fixation is mainly restricted to areas with observed low NO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>:PO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> ratios. Other models restrict N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fixation to N limited areas, but account also for light and temperature dependence (Can ESM, 
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Zahariev et al., 2008</xref>) and phosphate and iron limitation (IPSL-PISCES, 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Aumont et al., 2015</xref>). These methods implicitly assume a constant standing stock of diazotrophs and thereby require fewer assumptions on not well-known ecophysiological processes and parameters compared to models that explicitly model the dynamics of diazotrophs. Explicit parameterizations of N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fixation are mostly based on the assumption that diazotrophs are slow-growing photosynthetic organisms that can fix N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. This simple mechanistic approach results in diazotrophs being outcompeted by the faster growing ordinary phytoplankton in N-replete regions, yielding a control by excess PO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>, or P
 <sup class="sup">∗</sup>, in early on simple box-models (
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Tyrrell, 1999</xref>). Controls by other environmental factors such as temperature, light, iron (CESM, 
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Moore et al., 2013</xref>) and also specific trade-offs (e.g., DOP-uptake, 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Landolfi et al., 2015</xref>) or nitrate and oxygen inhibition (GFDL-TOPAZ, 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Dunne et al., 2013</xref>) have been implemented in more complex functional-types ecosystem-ocean circulation models, modulating the rates and regional patterns of fixation. Some studies also parameterize different groups of diazotrophs, in particular Trichodesmium-type, unicellular cyanobacteria, and diatom-cyanobacterial associations (
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Monteiro et al., 2010</xref>). There is a significant spread in global and regional N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fixation estimates by ESMs (
 <bold class="bold">Table 
  <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>
 </bold>). This arises from differences in model parameterizations and parameter values, and the different underlying circulation fields. In restoring approaches, N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fixation is strongly associated with regions of NO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> deficits, or high P
 <sup class="sup">∗</sup>, from denitrification in low-oxygen waters (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ilyina et al., 2013</xref>). This tight coupling is relaxed in parameterizations with temperature-dependent and Fe-limited growth rates, and also with NO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> uptake by diazotrophs (

 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Landolfi et al., 2017</xref>) or NO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> inhibition of N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fixation (

 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Aumont et al., 2015</xref>), which all tend to reduce the simulated rates of N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fixation in NO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>-replete regions (e.g., Eastern Tropical South Pacific upwelling) and enhance them toward warm, dusty and P-rich waters in line with the traditional paradigm (
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Redfield et al., 1963</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Falkowski, 1997</xref>). Most models do not reproduce the observed high fixation rates in the oligotrophic, dusty, North Atlantic due to the modeled low supply of P
 <sup class="sup">∗</sup> in this region. This implies that unaccounted factors may also be important in controlling marine diazotrophs and require to go beyond the traditional paradigm. In a recent model study, we found that preferential phosphorus remineralization, dissolved organic phosphors uptake (DOP), or Fe-limited growth, were all not able to significantly enhance P
 <sup class="sup">∗</sup> supply and expand the diazotrophs’ niche in this region. Only accounting for the elevated N-cost of dissolved organic P scavenging allowed the success of diazotrophs in the N-rich P-poor North Atlantic (

 <bold class="bold">Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1C</xref>
 </bold>). This theory, however, awaits experimental testing. Current global models do not account for non-cyanobacterial N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fixation, which requires a more in-depth understanding of the relevant players, their ecophysiology and their environmental controls.
