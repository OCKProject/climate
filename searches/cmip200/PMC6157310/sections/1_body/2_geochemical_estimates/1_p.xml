<p class="p">Geochemical estimates of N

 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Conkright et al., 2002</xref>), combined with information on ocean ventilation ages derived from measurements of abiotic transient tracers such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).

 </bold>). While this method has the advantage of integrating over large scales of space and time and implicitly includes potential contributions of non-cyanobacterial N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fixation, several potential shortcomings have been discussed: Impacts of non-Redfield remineralization of organic matter were addressed in 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Landolfi et al. (2008)</xref>, where we extended the inorganic N
 <sup class="sup">∗</sup> concept to total nitrogen excess, TN
 <sub class="sub">xs</sub>, to include organic nutrients. We found that for the subtropical North Atlantic, N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fixation rates estimated via TN
 <sub class="sub">xs</sub> were approximately twice as high as those estimated by the N
 <sup class="sup">∗</sup> method, but cautioned that other processes such as atmospheric N deposition (
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Zamora et al., 2010</xref>) and non-Redfield uptake of nutrients by phytoplankton (
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Mills and Arrigo, 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Weber and Deutsch, 2012</xref>), can also affect regional patterns of oceanic N
 <sup class="sup">∗</sup> and TN
 <sub class="sub">xs</sub> and thereby influence N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fixation rate estimates. These caveats also apply to the P
 <sub class="sub">t</sub>
 <sup class="sup">∗</sup> method introduced by 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Deutsch et al. (2007)</xref> that estimates N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fixation from the consumption of P
 <sub class="sub">t</sub>
 <sup class="sup">∗</sup>, which is defined as total excess P relative to the Redfield N equivalent. In contrast to the classical N
 <sup class="sup">∗</sup> tracer, but similar to TN
 <sub class="sub">xs</sub>, P
 <sub class="sub">t</sub>
 <sup class="sup">∗</sup> also accounts for organic nutrients. 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Deutsch et al. (2007)</xref> estimated a global N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fixation rate of 137 Tg N y
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (i.e., about 25% higher than the N
 <sup class="sup">∗</sup>-based estimate), with a very large contribution from surface waters in close proximity to the largest ODZ in the eastern South Pacific and only a small contribution from the P
 <sub class="sub">t</sub>
 <sup class="sup">∗</sup>-poor North Atlantic (
 <bold class="bold">Table 
  <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>
 </bold>). The P
 <sub class="sub">t</sub>
 <sup class="sup">∗</sup>-based estimate contrasts with the prevailing view of elevated N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fixation rates in the North Atlantic, as indicated both from N
 <sup class="sup">∗</sup> and experimental evidence (
 <bold class="bold">Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1</xref>
 </bold>). Besides the above mentioned non-Redfield processes other than N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fixation errors in the rate estimates also arise from the assumed ocean circulation that generally is not fully consistent with the observed nutrient fields to which it is applied. While current-generation global circulation models represent global-scale patterns reasonably well, they have particular deficiencies in reproducing low-oxygen regions (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Cabré et al., 2015</xref>) and tracer distributions in the tropical regions (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Dietze and Löptien, 2013</xref>). The refinement of global ocean GCMs is an on-going process. However, improvements to the geochemical methods may be limited given that the available nutrient distributions represent composites of data from decad of observations from a turbulent ocean, for which no underlying “mean” circulation may exist. Errors may also stem from uncertainties in tracer-derived water ages and age-based rate estimates: The differential effects of mixing on water age versus nutrient tracers may lead to errors in tracer-based N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fixation estimates (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Koeve and Kähler, 2016</xref>).
