<p class="p">Our current understanding of stabilizing N-inventory feedbacks stands on the regulatory-competition between N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fixers and non-fixing phytoplankton (Redfield, 1963; 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gruber, 2004</xref>). N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fixers fertilize the ocean with N until fixed N levels are, relative to P, high enough for their competitive exclusion. The potential for N inputs via non-cyanobacterial N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fixation independent of N deficits would fail this regulatory mechanism. Overall, the detailed mechanisms by which N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fixation responds to N losses are not well understood to have high confidence of marine nutrient cycles future predictions. In this context, the extent to which the North Atlantic stands out as a region of high N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fixation may be a pivotal question. Answering it will help to better understand how tight the feedback is between N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fixation and N loss processes.
