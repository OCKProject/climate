 <sub class="sub">3</sub> signature in the ocean. Although thermodynamically favorable (ΔG &lt; 0), the reduction of N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> to NH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> requires a large input of energy, from light or organic matter degradation, to proceed at measurable rates (
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Postgate, 1982</xref>) and maintain a low-oxygen cellular environment for the functioning of the enzyme complex nitrogenase. In ODZs the energy requirements may be reduced and iron limitation, a further constraint in oxic surface waters, may be relaxed. Here fixing N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> might be energetically advantageous compared with NO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>-uptake (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Großkopf and LaRoche, 2012</xref>). However, the low energetic efficiency of the anaerobic metabolism may quantitatively constrain the rates of non-cyanobacterial N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fixation, which may result in invisible (“cryptic”) nutrient and isotopic tracer-distributions patterns as denitrification and anammox may override its signature. Further investigations should asses the contribution of this process.
