<p class="p">As N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fixation and denitrification may be uncoupled, the oceanic N inventory is susceptible to imbalances. Despite the relatively short residence time of oceanic N of less than 3000 years (e.g., 
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Somes et al., 2013</xref>), the geological isotopic record suggests a close-to-balanced budget over the past 3000 years (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Altabet, 2007</xref>). This indicates the existence of negative feedbacks that stabilize the marine N reservoir. The nature, intensities and timescales of these feedbacks are still debated. Their effect on time scales shorter than those associated with the global ocean overturning circulation is assumed to require a spatial proximity of regions of N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fixation and N removal, such that any N deficit generated by denitrification in ODZs is rapidly compensated for by N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fixation (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Deutsch et al., 2007</xref>). However, because denitrification consumes more N than is fixed per mole of organic P, a too tight spatial coupling would lead to net N removal (
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Landolfi et al., 2013</xref>). Thus any N deficit may need to be transported and compensated for far away from ODZ-influenced regions, suggesting that longer (ocean-circulation) timescales may be required to counteract any N imbalance (
