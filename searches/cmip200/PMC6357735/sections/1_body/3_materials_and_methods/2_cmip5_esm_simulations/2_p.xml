<p class="p">In each model grid cell, we defined the warm season as the 3-month period with the highest mean temperature in the historical period. The warm season corresponds to the main growing season, when the drought- and aridity-induced terrestrial carbon loss mostly occur, except in the wet tropics where maximum productivity tends to occur in the dry season. We calculated GPP, TER, and NEP anomalies as the difference between monthly values and the mean monthly values in the warm season for historical and future simulations individually. Results of each model were bilinearly interpolated to a spatial resolution of 2° × 2°.</p>
