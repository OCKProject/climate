<p class="p">We used monthly temperature, relative humidity, total SM content, GPP, TER, and NEP data from CMIP5 simulations produced by 15 ESMs. VPD was calculated from temperature and relative humidity. We selected 32 pairs of ESM simulations with the required variables covering the historical (1871–2005) and future (2006–2100, the representative concentration pathway 8.5 scenario) periods. These models and corresponding ensembles are included in table S2. For comparison, we used data from two centennial periods: the historical period (1871–1970) and the future period (2001–2100) in this study. The last 5 years of the historical simulations were added to the beginning of the future simulations to have a 100-year future period.</p>
