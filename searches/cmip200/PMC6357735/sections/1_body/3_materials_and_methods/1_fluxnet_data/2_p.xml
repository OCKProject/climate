<p class="p">We selected 66 sites (529 site years) with data covering no less than 3 years (table S1). Daytime half-hourly data (7:00 a.m. to 19:00 pm) in the warm season were aggregated to daily values. The warm season was defined as days when running 7-day mean temperatures were higher than 60th percentile of daily temperature for the site. Across the 529 site years, 139 Â± 25 days were defined as warm season per year. At each site, GPP anomaly was calculated as the difference of daily GPP and the mean daily GPP in the warm season, and the same method was used to calculate the anomalies of TER and NEP.</p>
