<p class="p">We used half-hourly temperature, VPD, SM, GPP, TER, and NEP data from the FLUXNET2015 Dataset (

SM was measured as volumetric soil water content (percentage) at a shallow depth (varying across sites) because deep SM was measured at only limited sites (&lt;30). These data were processed following a consistent and uniform processing pipeline. We used temperature, VPD, and SM that were gap-filled using the marginal distribution method (
