<p class="p">We calculated mean anomalies of GPP, TER, and NEP in the 10 Ã— 10 percentile bins across the 66 sites to assess the observed mean responses of these variables to VPD and SM, especially the responses to extreme high VPD and low SM. In ESMs, mean anomalies of GPP, TER, and NEP due to compound VPD and SM extremes were calculated in each grid cell in historical and future simulations individually. Historical VPD and SM extremes were determined according to extreme VPD (above its 90th percentile) and SM (below its 10th percentile) in historical simulations. For all evaluations of future projections, we defined the high VPD and low SM thresholds in two ways: based on (i) the historical period and (ii) the future period. These two thresholds were used to calculate future PMF and mean anomalies of GPP, TER, and NEP due to compound VPD and SM extremes. A comparison of the thresholds between the two periods reflects changes in the intensity of compound extreme events. PMF changes based on the same thresholds reflect changes in the frequency of compound extreme events.</p>
