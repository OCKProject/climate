<p class="p">The VPD-SM coupling was evaluated by assessing the bivariate distributions of VPD and SM and calculating the Spearman correlation coefficient between them. We sorted observed daily VPD and SM from the flux tower sites into 10 Ã— 10 percentile bins in each site and calculated the mean probability of each percentile bin of VPD and SM across the 66 sites. PMF was calculated as the ratio of the probability in the top left bin in
