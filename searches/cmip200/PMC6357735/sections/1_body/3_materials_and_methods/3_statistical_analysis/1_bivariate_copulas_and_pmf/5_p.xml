<p class="p">We defined the PMF as the ratio of the joint probability with the copula and that assuming independent distributions (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.01). In other words, PMF quantifies the increase in frequency due to the covariations between VPD and SM, a value of one meaning that there is no change in frequency. To further evaluate the quality of the copula retrieval, we also directly estimated the joint probability by counting the joint occurrence rate of extreme high VPD and low SM based on model simulations and calculated the PMF using that method. Minimal differences were observed, both in historical and future simulations, so that the reliability of the copula method was confirmed (fig. S17). The consistent PMF derived using the two methods also demonstrated that the thresholds of VPD and SM extremes determined based on model simulations were reliable from the perspective of bivariate probability distribution. This was important for assessing the responses of carbon uptake to extreme high VPD and low SM, which were sensitive to the definition (or thresholds) of VPD and SM extremes.
