<p class="p">Compound drought and aridity events are driven by a series of complementary physical processes. Low SM reduces evapotranspiration, leading to higher temperature (

 </xref>) and VPD as a result of reduced evaporative cooling and near-surface humidity. Heightened VPD, in turn, positively forces land evapotranspiration, further accelerating the depletion of SM, compared to low VPD conditions. Co-occurring regional drought and heat wave extremes have greatly increased in frequency and intensity since the mid-1900s, despite the fact that there may not be a notable negative trend in the global mean SM (

 </xref>), potentially exacerbating the impacts of drought on terrestrial ecosystems. Here, we show that (i) compound VPD and SM extremes occur much more frequently than expected if VPD and SM were not intimately coupled, (ii) this coevolution of drought and aridity results in substantial ecosystem carbon losses, and (iii) the impacts of these compound extremes will strengthen in the future.
