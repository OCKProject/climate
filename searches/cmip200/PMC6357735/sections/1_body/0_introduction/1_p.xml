  <italic class="italic">3</italic>
 </xref>). Atmospheric aridity is typically assessed using the vapor pressure deficit (VPD), determined by the combination of atmospheric humidity and temperature. In response to high VPD, plants tend to reduce their stomatal conductance to minimize water loss (

  <italic class="italic">4</italic>
 </xref>). Decreased SM also triggers plant stomata to partially close to prevent hydraulic conductivity loss (

  <italic class="italic">5</italic>
 </xref>). Recent observational and modeling studies have emphasized that vegetation carbon uptake may be more sensitive to high VPD than to low SM (

 <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">6</italic>
 </xref>). While the effects of VPD and SM on vegetation are often evaluated as if they were independent, high VPD and low SM events are well known to often occur simultaneously (

  <italic class="italic">7</italic>
 </xref>â€“
 <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">9</italic>
 </xref>). The tendency for high VPD and low SM events to co-occur may cause drought- and heat-driven reductions in vegetation productivity to be much greater than if VPD and SM did not covary. It is crucial to evaluate the coupling of VPD and SM, especially the co-occurrence of extreme high VPD and low SM events globally, and the impact on terrestrial carbon uptake. Specifically, the intensity, frequency, and risks of compound drought and atmospheric aridity events, which have not been assessed before, are of great importance for terrestrial ecosystems, especially under future climate change.
