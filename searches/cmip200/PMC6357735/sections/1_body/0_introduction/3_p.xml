<p class="p">We used in situ observations from 66 flux tower sites spanning various climates and plant functional types and simulations from 15 Earth system models (ESMs), which were developed as part of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) (see the Supplementary Materials) to evaluate the co-occurrence probability of extreme high VPD and low SM and the impact of this covariation on terrestrial carbon uptake during the warm season. To assess effects on the terrestrial carbon budget, we used net ecosystem productivity (NEP) and its components: photosynthesis [gross primary productivity (GPP)] and respiration [total ecosystem respiration (TER)]. Drought stress is often measured according to precipitation deficits, and previous compound events have focused on drought and high temperature (

We evaluated the compound effects of co-occurring low SM and high VPD on terrestrial carbon uptake as these variables directly affect plant stomatal conductance and photosynthetic carbon assimilation (
