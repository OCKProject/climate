<p class="p">Our analysis relies on a percentile-based definition of extreme events. This kind of definition, which has been used to define extreme events in many studies of compound events (

 </xref>), allows for comparable extreme thresholds and ecosystem responses to extreme events for all ecosystems/grid cells and different periods. Although this percentile-based approach can work in most regions, it may be problematic in sites with short data records and in regions at high latitudes, where water stress did not occur during the study period. In these cases, we find positive GPP anomalies during the defined compound drought and aridity events (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Fig. 3A</xref>). We note that we did not consider the potential impacts of other factors, such as solar radiation and leaf area, on the VPD-SM coupling and the impacts of compound drought and aridity events on ecosystems. In addition, our analysis of the compound impact of extreme high VPD and low SM on carbon fluxes has uncertainties. Most ESMs do not incorporate plantsâ€™ adaptive capacity to new climate regimes, especially their adaption to extreme events, so the projected future carbon costs could be overestimated. In addition, we did not separate the individual impacts of extreme high VPD and low SM during compound events, as we demonstrated that these two variables are coupled and that the drought and aridity events co-occur, probably because of land-atmosphere coupling. Therefore, their impacts are difficult to separate, and we only assessed their additional impacts to show that compound extreme events lead to stronger negative impacts on NEP than extreme high VPD or low SM alone, using fully coupled ESMs. However, future work should aim at systemically separating those effects on ecosystems so that they can be better represented in models, as future VPD is expected to markedly increase in response to climate warming, whereas SM projections do not show ubiquitous drying globally (
