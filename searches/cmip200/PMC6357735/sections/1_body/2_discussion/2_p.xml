<p class="p">Because VPD and SM strongly covary, the impacts of their extremes should not be assessed in isolation. Although we also found strong temperature-SM coupling, the VPD-SM coupling is tighter, and VPD exerts more direct regulation on plant stomatal conductance and hence ecosystem productivity loss than temperature. Previous compound drought studies have focused on the occurrence of drought and heat events (
