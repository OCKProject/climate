<p class="p">Our study confirms (i) the strong coupling of VPD and SM and shows (ii) the detrimental impact of co-occurring extremes of VPD and SM on continental carbon uptake and (iii) increasing intensity, frequency, and net productivity costs of compound VPD and SM extremes in the 21st century. The negative VPD-SM coupling (e.g., low SM and high VPD) is mainly caused by land-atmosphere feedbacks (

 </xref>). High VPD stimulates evapotranspiration, which reduces SM; sustained SM deficit leads to reduced evapotranspiration and sensible heat increase, which dries and heats the near-surface air, resulting in positive VPD-SM feedbacks. Large-scale atmospheric anomalies (blocking, subsidence, and free tropospheric warming) may also play a role in the VPD-SM coupling and have been recognized as important causes for the initiation and perpetuation of drought and aridity events (
