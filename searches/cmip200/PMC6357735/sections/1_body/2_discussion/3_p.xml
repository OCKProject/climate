<p class="p">From a carbon perspective, compound VPD and SM extremes reduce terrestrial carbon uptake much more strongly than does either extreme considered in isolation. It could be expected that carbon uptake decline induced by compound extreme events will be offset by CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fertilization effects in the future, but this is not the case in many regions in the ESMs’ projections. ESMs tend to project future increases in the negative effects of compound extreme events on NEP such that, despite CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fertilization effects, future NEP during compound extreme events is close to and even lower than historical simulations, especially in the Amazon region, southeastern United States, and Southern Europe. In these regions, CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fertilization–induced increases in GPP are counteracted by more extreme compound events and increased respiration losses due to anthropogenic warming. As compound extreme events are predicted to increase, this might pose large threats to the capacity of continents to act as a carbon sink, and there may also be implications for food production, which is strongly affected by regional SM and VPD (
