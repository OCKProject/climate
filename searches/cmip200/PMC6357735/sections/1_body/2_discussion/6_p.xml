<p class="p">In summary, our results highlight the importance of compound drought and aridity events and their impact on continental carbon uptake, and the need to consider these factors in evaluation of future climate change risks. Considering the projected increases in the intensity and frequency of compound drought and aridity events in the 21st century, strategies should be developed and implemented to manage risks and improve adaptive capacity. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change special report on managing the risks of extreme events and disasters (

 </xref>) has suggested a series of approaches, such as sustainable land management and postdisaster recovery and reconstruction, for risk management. As part of this strategy, it is critical to better predict the occurrence of compound drought and aridity events and their effects on terrestrial ecosystems. Therefore, more studies are needed to fully understand the mechanisms of the occurrence of compound extreme events, including land-atmosphere feedbacks and large-scale atmospheric anomalies generating those extremes, and the impacts of extreme high VPD and low SM on ecosystems. These mechanisms can help to further improve ESMs and better predict compound extreme events and their impacts on the capacity of continents to act as a carbon sink in the future.
