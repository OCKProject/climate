<p class="p">Negative NEP anomalies in CMIP5 models with extreme high VPD and low SM are much stronger than anomalies when only one of these variables is considered as extreme (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref> and figs. S12 and S13). During compound drought and aridity events, the negative additional effect of extreme VPD is stronger than that of extreme SM across 72% of the land area in historical simulations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>, A and B), confirming the importance of VPD for ecosystem carbon uptake as indicated in recent studies (

 </xref>). In future simulations, however, the additional effect of extreme low SM on NEP is projected to exceed that of extreme high VPD in the Northern Hemisphere (especially above 40Â°N) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>, C to F). This does not apply to the Amazon and Congo basins, mainly because warming greatly enhances TER costs in these tropical regions (fig. S14) (
 <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">22</italic>
 </xref>). The additional effect of extreme low SM on GPP significantly exceeds the additional effect of extreme high VPD in future simulations for almost all land areas (fig. S15), highlighting the increasing importance of SM limitations to carbon assimilation.
