<p class="p">We then evaluated the impacts of extreme VPD and SM on GPP and NEP simulated by ESMs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>). Simulated GPP anomalies during compound extreme events are negative in most regions, except in boreal regions where GPP is enhanced because boreal vegetation tends to be temperature limited (

  <italic class="italic">19</italic>
 </xref>). Compound-event TER is also greatly enhanced in boreal regions but slightly decreases over most other regions between 50°S and 50°N, in agreement with observational results (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Figs. 1G</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3K</xref>), since most of the flux tower sites are located in mid- and low latitudes (table S1). The combination of GPP and TER leads to negative NEP anomalies during compound events over more than 75% of the land area during the two periods (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>, C and F). The projected warming and drying trend in most regions leads to higher 90th percentiles of VPD and lower 10th percentiles of SM (i.e., higher intensity of the compound extreme events; fig. S10), resulting in stronger negative anomalies of GPP and NEP in most regions during the 21st century (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>, A to F). If we instead assess future extremes according to historical thresholds, then compound-event GPP and NEP reductions are still projected to strengthen in the future (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>, G and I, and fig. S11, D and F). Combined with the tremendous projected increases in the co-occurrence rate and magnitudes of concurrent VPD and SM extremes in many regions globally, the projected GPP and NEP reductions due to compound drought and aridity events imply increasingly common and large reductions in ecosystem carbon uptake in the future [
