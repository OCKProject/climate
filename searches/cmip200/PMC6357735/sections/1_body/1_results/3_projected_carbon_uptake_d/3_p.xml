However, because of large projected increases in TER (fig. S16, B, E, and H), NEP during compound events is simulated to be similar in both the future and historical simulations in many nonboreal areas, despite CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fertilization effects (fig. S16, C, F, and I). It should also be noted that the CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fertilization effect on GPP is offset by future more extreme compound events in some regions, such as Amazon region, southeastern United States, and Southern Europe, where the respiration losses lead to lower future NEP than historical simulations with minimal projected increases in GPP (fig. S16, C, F, and I). Vegetation mortality and subsequent regrowth and succession processes are poorly simulated by ESMs, and if large drops in productivity due to extreme events lead to enhanced vegetation mortality, then, in reality, the effects on terrestrial productivity and carbon storage may be greater than simulated by ESMs (
