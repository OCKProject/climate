<p class="p">Under combined extreme high VPD and low SM conditions, NEP anomalies (−2.29 ± 2.03 g C · m

 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) are largely determined by GPP anomalies (−2.67 ± 2.62 g C · m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> · day
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>), while TER is slightly reduced (−0.35 ± 1.06 g C · m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> · day
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) due to the compensatory effect of high VPD (and correlated high temperature) and low SM on TER (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1G</xref>). As expected, decreasing GPP and NEP are found for more extreme high VPD and low SM conditions, while TER is relatively stable across different extreme levels (fig. S1, B to D). We also considered an alternate definition of the bivariate extremes using extreme temperature (above its 90th percentile) instead of VPD since others have investigated compound drought and heat events (

 </xref>). Weaker correlation (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = −0.23 ± 0.17) is found between temperature and SM, as well as lower PMF (1.8 ± 1.1) (fig. S3, E and F). We also find a smaller decline in mean GPP (−1.82 ± 3.71 g C · m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> · day
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) and NEP (−1.73 ± 2.97 g C · m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> · day
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>), with larger variations across sites under extreme high temperature and low SM (fig. S3G). These results indicate that considering low SM and high VPD extremes together more fully captures the negative impacts of drought and aridity on terrestrial carbon cycling than when considering the effects of SM and temperature or of SM or VPD individually. Although VPD is largely controlled by temperature, with a rank correlation coefficient of 0.67 ± 0.14 between them, only 57 ± 17% of the extreme high VPD and temperature occurred simultaneously, and the other extreme high VPD events were mainly promoted by low atmospheric humidity (fig. S4). The potential for drought- or heat-driven carbon loss is therefore underestimated without the consideration of atmospheric humidity to define compound extreme events.
