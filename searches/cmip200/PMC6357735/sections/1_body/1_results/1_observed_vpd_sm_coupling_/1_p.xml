<p class="p">We binned daily VPD and SM observations in the 66 flux tower sites into 10 × 10 bins and assessed the co-occurrence probability and anomalies of GPP, TER, and NEP in each bin (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>, A to D). A strong negative correlation between VPD and SM is evident (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = −0.33 ± 0.20, intersite mean ± 1 SD) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>, A and E), along with bimodality with more distribution toward both ends: high VPD–low SM and low VPD–high SM. To focus on extreme drought and aridity events, we defined the bivariate extremes as being both with SM below its 10th percentile and VPD above its 90th percentile. We used the probability multiplication factor (PMF) to assess the increased frequency of compound events compared to that expected if SM and VPD were independent (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.1 × 0.1 = 0.01). We empirically find that the joint probability of the bivariate extremes is about twice that of the independent combinations (PMF = 2.1 ± 1.1) across the 66 sites (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1F</xref>), emphasizing that extreme VPD and SM events are not independent and largely co-occurring. By using varying thresholds (80th to 99th percentiles for VPD and 20th to 1st percentiles for SM correspondingly) to define extreme events, we find higher PMF for more extreme compound events (fig. S1A), indicating stronger dependence between higher VPD and lower SM conditions.
