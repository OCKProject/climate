<p class="p">GPP responds to VPD both nonlinearly and nonmonotonically: At low VPD when temperature is generally low, GPP is promoted as VPD rises due to warming because increased temperature promotes photochemistry (

 </xref>). On the other hand, when VPD is high, further increases in VPD correspond to GPP reductions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1B</xref> and fig. S2A) due to stomatal closure, which strongly inhibits plant photosynthesis (

 </xref>). TER increases with VPD, and correlated temperature, at a more moderate pace (
