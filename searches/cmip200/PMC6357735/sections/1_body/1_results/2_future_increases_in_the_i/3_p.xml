<p class="p">There is only a small difference in PMF (0.19 Â± 0.51) derived with copulas between the two periods (fig. S9A). However, the extreme high VPD and low SM become more extreme in the future, with much higher future threshold used to define an extreme high VPD event (above its 90th percentile) and a lower future threshold for SM (below its 10th percentile) (fig. S10). This indicates an intensification of compound extreme events due to greenhouse gas increase and land surface changes. In addition, when using the historical thresholds to define extreme high VPD and low SM events, the frequency of co-occurring extreme VPD and SM events is projected to increase substantially in the future (

The increase in PMF is greater than 10 for 58% of the land area (excluding Antarctica and Greenland) between the two periods and more than 20 for 18% of the land area, especially in the Amazon region, Central Asia, Southern Europe, and Northern and Southern Africa (fig. S9B). These increases in the intensity and frequency of compound drought and aridity events have important implications for the capacity of continents to act as a carbon sink in the future (
