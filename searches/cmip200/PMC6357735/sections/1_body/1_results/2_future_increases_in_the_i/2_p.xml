<p class="p">We then modeled the bivariate distribution of VPD and SM in the CMIP5 simulations with copulas (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>). A high CMIP5 PMF (&gt;3) was found in regions of strong negative correlation between VPD and SM, such as the southeastern United States, Amazon region, Southern Africa, and East and Southeast Asia during the two periods (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>, A and B, and fig. S7). These regions with high PMF and large negative VPD-SM correlation exhibit strong VPD-SM interactions in both historical and future simulations because the strong negative correlation persists even when removing the long-term trends in VPD and SM (fig. S7). Most of the regions listed above have been reported to have strong SM-climate coupling, i.e., are hot spots of land-atmosphere coupling (
 <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">7</italic>
 </xref>). We also find large SM variability in these regions for both historical and future simulations (fig. S8). Larger SM variability can generate stronger impact on the partitioning of latent and sensible heat fluxes and, hence, atmospheric conditions, resulting in stronger SM-VPD coupling.
