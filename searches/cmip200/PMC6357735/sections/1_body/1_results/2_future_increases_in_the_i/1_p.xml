<p class="p">To understand past and future projected extremes and their impacts on contemporaneous terrestrial carbon uptake, we used centennial simulations from 15 ESMs of historical (1871–1970) and projected future (2001–2100) conditions in CMIP5 (see Materials and Methods). The negative correlation between VPD and SM, as well as the bimodal distribution apparent in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1A</xref>, is found for all models both in historical and future simulations (figs. S5 and S6). These model simulations of the VPD-SM relationship are largely consistent with flux tower observational results, indicating that ESMs realistically simulate compound VPD and SM extremes.
