 <p class="p">Comments by two anonymous reviewers have been crucial for shaping the final version of this manuscript, in particular regarding the role of aerosols and regarding the robustness of the linear relationship between temperature and greenhouse gas emissions. We are very grateful for their constructive reviews. We are also grateful to Laura Niederdrenk for helpful feedback and discussions.</p>
