<p id="Par44" class="p">In contrast, the pace of winter sea-ice loss accelerates once the total area covered in summer approaches nearly ice-free conditions, both in idealized studies [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" class="xref">63</xref>]. This behavior has recently been explained by geometric reasons, since the winter sea-ice covering the Arctic Ocean after the loss of summer sea ice will have a rather small homogeneous thickness and can thus be removed quickly [
