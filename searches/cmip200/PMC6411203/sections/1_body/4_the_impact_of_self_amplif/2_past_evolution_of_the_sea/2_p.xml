<p id="Par40" class="p">Several stabilizing feedbacks during winter contribute to the lack of self-amplification even in light of the ice-albedo feedback [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" class="xref">53</xref>]: First, any ice-free parts of the Arctic Ocean more effectively lose their heat to the atmosphere than those parts that remained ice-covered during winter [
