<p id="Par36" class="p">Internal variability will remain superimposed on any externally forced trend. Hence, for a given year, the expected ice coverage can be calculated as the expected externally forced ice coverage based on the mean global air temperature plus/minus a specific ice coverage given by internal variability. Given the estimated 95% likelihood interval of at maximum ± 1 million km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> in sea coverage, we can use the observed sensitivity to translate the internal variability of sea-ice coverage to likelihood ranges for any given linear driver of sea-ice evolution. By dividing 1 million km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> through the observed sensitivities summarized in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>, we find that the temperature at which the Arctic first becomes ice free will have a 95% uncertainty range from internal variability of ± 0.2 to 0.4 
 <sup class="sup">∘</sup>C. These values are in line with results from large-ensemble model simulations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">36</xref>]. Combined with the temperature threshold of less than + 2 
 <sup class="sup">∘</sup>C for a near ice-free ocean during summer, this then implies low, but above zero chances for a near-ice free Arctic ocean at + 1.5 
 <sup class="sup">∘</sup>C global warming. Again, this is in line with existing recent studies [
