<p id="Par34" class="p">CMIP5 models display on average a similar variability. In their pre-industrial control simulations, the average standard deviation of September sea-ice area is

 <italic class="italic">σ</italic> 95% confidence interval, the models and the observations suggest a maximum impact of internal variability on September sea-ice coverage of less than ± 1 million km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> for any given year for pre-industrial ice coverage. The internal variability depends on the sea-ice-covered area and reaches in model simulations a maximum at a sea-ice extent of around 3 million km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">25</xref>]. With a further decrease in sea-ice cover, internal variability decreases towards pre-industrial values and eventually drops to zero as ice-coverage drops to zero [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">25</xref>]. As in the following, we are primarily interested in internal variability for low ice coverage, we take the pre-industrial value as a conservative estimate for the relevant internal variability of a future low ice state. This is in line with the finding that the long-term mean variability for the decreasing ice coverage of a high-emission scenario is across the CMIP5 models very similar to the pre-industrial long-term mean variability [
