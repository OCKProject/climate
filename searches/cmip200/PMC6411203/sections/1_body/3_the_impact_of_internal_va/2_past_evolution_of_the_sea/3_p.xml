 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">29</xref>]. This is in line with a more process-oriented study examining the link between atmospheric variability and the resulting evolution of the sea-ice cover [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">28</xref>]. This might also explain why sea-ice loss has slowed down during summer since 2012, as the ice cover is ”recovering” from an extreme-event ice loss to the long-term trend line provided by the external forcing. A possible explanation for this behavior relates to changes in ocean circulation arising from internal variability [
