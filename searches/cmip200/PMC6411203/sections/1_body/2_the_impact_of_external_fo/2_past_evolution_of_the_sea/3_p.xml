<p id="Par22" class="p">Other changes in external forcing have only had a limited impact on the sea-ice cover in the past few decades. For example, the observational record shows no substantial co-variation of Arctic sea ice with changes in solar activity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>]. In particular, the slight weakening of solar activity since the early 2000s is inconsistent with the ongoing rapid loss of Arctic sea ice. Large observed volcanic eruptions such as El Chichon in 1982 and Mount Pinatubo in 1991 caused a small increase in simulated sea-ice coverage in the ensemble mean of large ensemble simulations, but their impact can not be identified in individual simulations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">29</xref>]. This is particularly relevant given that the impact of volcanic eruptions has been suggested to be overestimated in CMIP5 model simulations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>]. Hence, natural changes in the external forcing have not played a major role for the observed evolution of the Arctic sea-ice cover.
