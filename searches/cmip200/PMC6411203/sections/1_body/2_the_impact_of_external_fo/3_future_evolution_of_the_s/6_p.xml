<p id="Par29" class="p">With temperature being the main driver of the long-term sea-ice evolution of the Arctic, regardless of the drivers for that temperature increase, the future evolution of the sea-ice cover is most robustly described in reference to this variable. However, because the observed near linear relationship between global-mean temperature and cumulative anthropogenic CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions has been found to very likely remain unchanged for the foreseeable future [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">44</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">47</xref>], this relationship can be exploited to describe the future evolution of the sea-ice cover in response to cumulative future CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>]. The observed sensitivity of the Arctic sea-ice cover to cumulative anthropogenic CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions suggests an on average ice-free Arctic Ocean throughout August and September for an additional maximum 800 Gt of anthropogenic CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions. This estimate is based on the observed sensitivity of about 3-m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> sea-ice-area loss per ton of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions in these months [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref>] and the average sea-ice area of the past 10 years. For an additional 1400 Gt of anthropogenic CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions, the Arctic Ocean will become largely sea-ice free from July to October [
