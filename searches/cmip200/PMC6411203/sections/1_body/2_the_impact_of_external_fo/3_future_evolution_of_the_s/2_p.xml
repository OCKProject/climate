<p id="Par25" class="p">Unfortunately, as shown by the values for the September sea-ice cover listed in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>, uncertainty exists as to the true sensitivity of the sea-ice cover to a given amount of warming. The main sources of uncertainty are the choice of the underlying observational records of sea-ice coverage and global-mean temperature, and the method used to estimate the sensitivity from any given pair of observational records. Regarding the latter, [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>] divide the temporal trend of sea-ice coverage by the temporal trend of global-mean temperature to estimate sea-ice sensitivity, while all other estimates in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref> are based on an ordinary least-square regression of sea-ice coverage on global-mean temperature. This latter approach has been suggested to underestimate the true sensitivity of the sea-ice cover [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>], as it implies a primarily unidirectional relationship between the two variables. Therefore, the inverse of temperature regressed on sea-ice area gives a higher estimate than the direct regression of sea-ice area on temperature. However, one could also argue that the simple linear regression is justified by the primarily one-way causal relationship between global warming and sea-ice loss, suggesting that this estimate reflects the true sensitivity.
