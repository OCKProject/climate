<p id="Par16" class="p">Second, the relationship of a model to the real world is often very difficult to estimate [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>], which makes it difficult to infer robust quantitative statements from model simulations. In particular, internal variability renders a perfect agreement of a model simulation with reality impossible, such that a disagreement between a model simulation and the real world does not allow one to directly obtain insights on the quality of a particular model simulation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">20</xref>]. Any model evaluation must hence take internal variability into account [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>]. On the other hand, an agreement of a specific model simulation with some observed record does not necessarily indicate a reasonable description of the underlying processes in the numerical code of the model, but might instead just indicate a reasonable tuning of the model to match the observational record [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">21</xref>] or be caused by compensating errors. For example, [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>] suggest that models participating in the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">23</xref>]) better reproduce the observed loss of Arctic sea ice compared to the models participating in CMIP3, because in CMIP5, the prescribed external forcing from volcanic eruptions is too strong. Furthermore, agreement of a model with the past evolution of an observable is not necessarily an indication for reliable projections of the future evolution of that observable [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>].
