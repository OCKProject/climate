<p id="Par4" class="p">The observed recent loss of Arctic sea ice is probably the clearest indicator of the ongoing rapid changes in the climate state of our planet. Over the past few decades, the sea-ice-covered area of the Arctic Ocean has been reduced by about half during summer [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>], and the ice thickness has also been reduced by about half [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>]. In combination, this suggests that todayâ€™s volume of the Arctic summer sea-ice cover is only roughly a quarter of what it used to be just a few decades ago. In this review, we summarize our current understanding of how the remaining Arctic sea ice will evolve in the future.
