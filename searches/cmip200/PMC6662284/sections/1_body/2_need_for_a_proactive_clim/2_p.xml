<p class="p">Species' declines and extinctions are predicted to escalate as changes in land‐use, climate, and other stressors intensify (Selwood, McGeoch, &amp; Mac Nally, 
 <xref rid="ece35277-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Many conservation plans focus on the impacts from mean, long‐term climatic changes but fail to consider changes in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather and climatic events (Maxwell et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35277-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2019</xref>). Moreover, compared to climate change mitigation and adaptation plans developed for human communities, few management strategies have been developed specifically for imperiled species, and ones targeting amphibians are especially rare (Appendix 
 <xref rid="ece35277-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref>A). Many actions that are designed for human communities, such as construction of flood levees and dikes, could be modified appropriately to protect biodiversity. The few climate adaptation actions that have been explored for amphibians primarily focus on mediating effects of temperature increases and more variable precipitation (Griffis‐Kyle, 
 <xref rid="ece35277-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>; Shoo et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35277-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). Muths and Fisher (
 <xref rid="ece35277-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>) pointed out a similar lack of action planning in response to the amphibian decline crisis. Consequently, Grant et al. (
 <xref rid="ece35277-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>) issued a call for improved responses to the potential threat of emerging infectious diseases, a significant factor in the declines and extinctions of amphibian species.
