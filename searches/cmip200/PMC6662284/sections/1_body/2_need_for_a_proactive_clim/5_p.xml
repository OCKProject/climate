<p class="p">A need to improve preparation for climate change in recovery planning is not unique to the United States; mention of specific actions to address climate change is relatively uncommon in recovery plans in Australia as well (Hoeppner &amp; Hughes, 
 <xref rid="ece35277-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>). In part because of the difficulty in keeping recovery plans up‐to‐date, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) has revised its approach to recovery planning and implementation (USFWS, 
 <xref rid="ece35277-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). The agency's framework currently consists of three integrated components—a Species Status Assessment, the Recovery Plan, and a Recovery Implementation Strategy (RIS) for each listed species. Unlike past approaches, the RIS facilitates adaptation to changing circumstances and, thus, more flexibility in recovery strategies (USFWS, 
 <xref rid="ece35277-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). This new, stream‐lined framework is built upon the 3R platform, and its adoption provides an opportunity to integrate new approaches to buffering against catastrophic events like hurricanes. However, given that 30% of 1,660 currently listed species are still in need of a recovery plan, and the USFWS National Listing Workplan prioritizes &gt;550 other species that are awaiting status reviews and listing determinations, it is unclear when existing recovery plans may be reviewed for possible updating (USFWS, 
 <xref rid="ece35277-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018b</xref>). Even once developed, implementation of such actions is generally slow and remains a significant challenge to conservation and management of imperiled species in a changing climate (Stein et al.,
