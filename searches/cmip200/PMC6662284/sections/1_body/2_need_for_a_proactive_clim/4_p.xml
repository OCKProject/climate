<p class="p">Of 381 threatened and endangered species (Endangered Species Act of 1973) that occur in the southeastern USA, half (191 species) may be found in coastal regions that are vulnerable to the impacts of hurricanes (Appendix

 <xref rid="ece35277-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S3</xref>). Of 65 species of listed vertebrates, six currently have no formal recovery plan (with a seventh, Bachman's Warbler, exempt from recovery planning). Many others have static, outdated recovery plans (i.e., 8–36 years old)—the status of many recovery plans, in general (Malcom &amp; Li, 
 <xref rid="ece35277-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>)—that do not consider recent projections of hurricane threats (Appendix

 <xref rid="ece35277-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S3</xref>). For example, only 33 vertebrate species in this region have recovery plans that mention hurricanes and, of those, the need for management actions in response to the threat of hurricanes is discussed for only five (St. Andrew beach mouse, red‐cockaded woodpecker, guajon, reticulated and frosted flatwoods salamanders) and, to a limited extent, for three others (a total of 12% of all vertebrate species considered). For several species, hurricanes are secondary threats compared to others (e.g., habitat loss, fragmentation, and degradation), which may partially explain why the threat of hurricanes is not addressed in their recovery plans. For others, the potential impacts of hurricanes do not appear to be thoroughly discussed or documented with supporting data. For example, in the Cape Sable Seaside Sparrow (
 <italic class="italic">Ammodramus maritimus mirabilis</italic>) recovery plan, the USFWS (
 <xref rid="ece35277-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1999</xref>) stated that “declines in population numbers were detected following Hurricane Andrew; however, a leveling off of declines, or rebound in population numbers, would be expected if populations were recovering from a 
 <italic class="italic">single adverse event</italic> [italics ours], such as Hurricane Andrew. Instead, declines continued as would be expected under continuing adverse hydrological conditions.” In another example, the Recovery Plan for the Loggerhead Sea Turtle (
 <italic class="italic">Caretta caretta</italic>) stated that “sea turtles have evolved a strategy to offset these natural events by laying large numbers of eggs and by distributing their nests both spatially and temporally,” despite reporting losses of up to 54% of entire nests in various tropical storm systems that occurred from 1985 to 2001 (USFWS,
