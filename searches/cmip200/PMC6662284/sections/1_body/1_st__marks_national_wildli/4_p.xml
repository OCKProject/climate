<p class="p">Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35277-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>c shows the predicted outcome of 1 m of future sea level rise in this area. Under this scenario, sea levels would approach Critical Habitat Units FFS‐3A and FFS‐3B and would inundate a few breeding sites. However, perhaps the most dramatic occurrence would be the advancement of marsh habitat in front of encroaching sea levels (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35277-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>d): the habitat that encompasses most of the current freshwater wetlands in these units would change to brackish marsh, conditions that would presumably be incompatible with persistence of flatwoods salamanders.
