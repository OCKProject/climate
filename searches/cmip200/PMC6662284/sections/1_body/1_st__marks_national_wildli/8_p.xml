<p class="p">Importantly, as of 10 December 2018, we had captured 36 live adult flatwoods salamanders, all but one of which was captured in traps at drift fences (one was found underneath debris in shallow water). These captures represented 34 unique individuals: 10 individuals were recaptured from previous seasons and two were recaptured within the fall 2018 season. These captures were at both overwashed and non‐overwashed sites and included five gravid females ready to lay eggs. Although at least some adult individuals survived the storm, the potential effects of salt‐contaminated soil and pond water on terrestrially deposited eggs and aquatic larvae are unknown for this species. Therefore, it is not yet possible for us to estimate the demographic consequences of this storm. Continued sampling of 11 ponds after the storm indicated that SpC declined over an 8‐week period, but this decline could reflect dilution of pond water because &gt;300 mm of rainfall fell in the area during that time (Figure
