<p class="p">Hurricane Michael made landfall at Category 5 intensity on the Saffir–Simpson scale, with a maximum sustained wind speed of 160 mph (257 kph) and a minimum pressure of 919 mb (Beven, Berg, &amp; Hagen, 
 <xref rid="ece35277-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2019</xref>). This storm rapidly intensified in the 24 hr preceding landfall and was one of only four Category 5 hurricanes to make landfall in the United States, with projected peak storm surge inundation values as high as 4.3 m above ground level (AGL) along the Gulf of Mexico coast (Beven et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35277-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2019</xref>). A U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) survey team measured a high water mark of 2.4 m AGL (3.6 NAVD88; USGS, 
 <xref rid="ece35277-bib-0066" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>) within the Refuge (Beven et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35277-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2019</xref>), and a high water mark close to our study ponds indicated storm surge reached 3 m (NAVD88) above sea level in that area (USGS, 
 <xref rid="ece35277-bib-0066" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>). This storm surge was exacerbated by counter clockwise winds that pushed water from the Gulf of Mexico as much as 6.4 km inland, swamping at least 17 freshwater ponds used by

 <xref rid="ece35277-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018a</xref>). These ponds were the only ones we were able to measure; assuming other ponds located between these 17 were also inundated, the total number of inundated ponds would be at least 35. Although this water would normally recede within approximately a day, the area in which many of these ponds are located was covered with seawater for at least a week because of an elevated tram road south of the ponds (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35277-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>), which impeded the outward flow of water.
