<p class="p">We hypothesize that there will be differences in salamander vital rates across the Refuge: not all wetlands were inundated by storm surge and specific conductance varied among those that were (Figure

 <italic class="italic">Taricha granulosa</italic>), individuals occupying a coastal stream on the Pacific Coast of North America varied in their physiological tolerance to elevated salinity, with individuals closer to the ocean exhibiting less of a response to salt stress than those found farther upstream (Hopkins et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35277-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Physiological plasticity is a significant means by which species may persist across varying environmental conditions (Chevin &amp; Hoffmann,

 <xref rid="ece35277-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>). Ultimately, plasticity may buffer some species from extinction by promoting physiological, behavioral, and/or other adaptations that could minimize potentially lethal exposure to stressors such as salinity (Chown et al.,
