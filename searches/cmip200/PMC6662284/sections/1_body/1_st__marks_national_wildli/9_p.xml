<p class="p">We are continuing to monitor these breeding ponds and, in February and March 2019, we captured only 11 aquatic larvae during 4,940 trap‐nights at three of 60 ponds surveyed. In contrast, in spring 2018, we captured 532 larvae during 3,340 trap‐nights at 23 of 58 ponds surveyed. These results indicate a 71.5‐fold decrease in larval captures per trap‐night effort and a decrease from 40% of ponds occupied (not adjusting for imperfect detection) to only 5% in 2019. Although not conclusive, these results suggest that juvenile recruitment was extremely low in 2019 following the storm, perhaps because developing embryos and aquatic larvae are more sensitive to salinity than are adults. Additionally, in 2018 above‐normal rainfall occurred in summer preceding the onset of fall salamander breeding migrations and continued into early winter, encompassing the peak migration period (e.g., from May to December, this region received 126.4 cm of rainfall in 2018 compared to 80.5 cm in 2017; Western Region Climate Center [WRCC],

The timing and amount of rainfall during these months are critical to reproductive success of flatwoods salamanders: the above‐normal rainfall this region received in summer 2018 did not allow these normally ephemeral ponds to dry, which allowed aquatic predators (e.g., fishes, crayfish, and insects) of larval salamanders to persist. These hypotheses need to be tested empirically to tease apart the interacting effects of salinity, hydroperiod, and predation on different life history stages of this species.
