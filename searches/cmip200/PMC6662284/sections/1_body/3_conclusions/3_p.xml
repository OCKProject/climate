<p class="p">Information on this species' tolerance of salinity, the short‐term effects of the storm on immediate mortality, and longer‐term effects on population viability are lacking. It is premature to assess whether any populations were extirpated because of this storm, which will require several years of poststorm monitoring (Adams et al.,

 <xref rid="ece35277-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1998</xref>). It would also be extremely difficult to detect storm‐related mortality in individuals of this small‐bodied amphibian, which do not linger in the environment very long after death or are readily scavenged by predators. Moreover, these fossorial animals probably were not active on the surface at the time of the storm's impact, and therefore, mortality may have occurred in their burrows or under vegetation that we could not search. The options we outline for developing hurricane‐adaptation plans are relevant to flatwoods salamander populations at St. Marks National Wildlife Refuge, as well as to other ecological communities in coastal areas. The alternative option—to do nothing or to maintain the status quo—until we do know more about these topics is a high‐risk strategy for an imperiled species with low resiliency and very little redundancy of populations across its range. In such circumstances, one catastrophic event (natural or otherwise) could eliminate, or at least seriously compromise, all remaining populations of a given species (e.g., the extinction of the Golden Toad,
