<p class="p">For 
 <italic class="italic">A. cingulatum</italic>, reducing vulnerability to hurricanes and related storm surge events will ultimately depend on the existence of resilient, redundant, and representative populations throughout this species' historical range. Both species of flatwoods salamanders are experiencing severe population losses, and, of those that remain, resiliency is likely low to moderate (USFWS, 2019a). In terms of redundancy, 
 <italic class="italic">A. cingulatum</italic> currently exists only as isolated metapopulations in a few locations within its historical range (Semlitsch et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35277-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). The USFWS considers there to be only two representative units, one of which contains only one known breeding site of moderate resiliency (USFWS, 
 <xref rid="ece35277-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2019a</xref>). Should that population become extirpated and no other natural populations are found in this unit, then losing that population would mean the loss of an entire representation unit (USFWS, 
 <xref rid="ece35277-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2019a</xref>). The remaining representation unit would include St. Marks National Wildlife Refuge and Apalachicola National Forest, both of which are considered relative strongholds for occupancy by 
 <italic class="italic">A. cingulatum</italic>. Prior to the Hurricane Michael, the Refuge had many redundant populations of moderate resiliency (USFWS, 
 <xref rid="ece35277-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2019a</xref>). Our continued monitoring of Refuge populations will allow us to assess whether wetlands that were overwashed during the hurricane continue to support frosted flatwoods salamanders. In addition, the Refuge has recently expanded its northern boundary through land acquisition and is partnering with state and other federal government agencies to restore habitat to suitable conditions within this area. Eventually, captive‐reared flatwoods salamanders could be translocated to restored wetlands to the north, as outlined in the species' Draft Recovery Plan (USFWS, 
 <xref rid="ece35277-bib-0064" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2019b</xref>). Ultimately, the development and implementation of a climate and, specifically, hurricane‐adaptation strategy will help ensure the long‐term persistence of this species in the face of a changing climate.
