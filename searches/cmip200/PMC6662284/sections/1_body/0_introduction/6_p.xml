<p class="p">We provide preliminary assessments of some environmental and biological impacts from storm surge associated with Hurricane Michael. On 10 October 2018, this storm made landfall in the panhandle region of Florida and resulted in saltwater inundation in some areas of the Refuge, including many wetlands used by 
 <italic class="italic">A. cingulatum</italic> for breeding. We also explore the extent to which hurricane‐adaptation strategies have been developed for imperiled vertebrates in hurricane‐prone coastal areas. Based on our assessments, we outline the need for a proactive management framework to reduce risk of future catastrophic storm impacts on vulnerable populations of this species, in particular, and for imperiled species in hurricane‐prone regions, in general.
