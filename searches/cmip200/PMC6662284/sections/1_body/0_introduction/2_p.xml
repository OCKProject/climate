<p class="p">A species' viability is shaped by local and landscape scale processes that reflect three fundamental conservation principles, collectively known as “the 3Rs” (Shaffer &amp; Stein, 
 <xref rid="ece35277-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>; Smith et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35277-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>; U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service [USFWS], 
 <xref rid="ece35277-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). At the local scale, 
 <italic class="italic">resiliency</italic> refers to the ability of individual populations to withstand environmental and demographic stochasticity. At the landscape scale, a viable species has sufficient 
 <italic class="italic">representation</italic> across a variety of ecological settings, enabling it to adapt to changing environmental conditions over space and time. Lastly, a species' viability depends on 
 <italic class="italic">redundancy</italic>, the existence of multiple populations at both scales, minimizing extinction risk due to catastrophic events. Most species of conservation concern are deficient in one or more of these three measures, but those that have few, small, isolated populations with limited geographic ranges are especially at risk (Purvis, Gittleman, Cowlishaw, &amp; Mace, 
 <xref rid="ece35277-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>; Soulé, 
 <xref rid="ece35277-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1987</xref>), as “no single population is immune to the chance of catastrophic extinction” (Shaffer &amp; Stein, 
 <xref rid="ece35277-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>).
