  <p class="p">Two of the principal stressors, changes in climate and habitat, that impact populations of the frosted flatwoods salamander, along with their ecological and demographic consequences. Dashed lines represent examples of indirect effects from key consequences. The double arrow between the two sets of consequences indicates that changes in climate and habitat interact synergistically to compound the negative effects of each stressor individually</p>
