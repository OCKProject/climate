    <p class="p">We analyzed terrestrial carbon fluxes as simulated by an earth system model over the last 1,000 years to study the variability across timescales</p>

    <p class="p">Variability in NBP was largely driven by carbon input through NPP, with an increasing contribution from the response of carbon residence time to external forcing at longer timescales</p>

    <p class="p">On centennial timescales, preindustrial greenhouse gases were the dominant forcing of the land carbon cycle, followed by huge volcanic eruptions</p>
