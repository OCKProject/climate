  <p class="p">Spatial patterns of the relative contributions (expressed as a fraction) of the variance in (a, c, and e) net biome production (NBP) driven solely by variation in net primary production (NPP) and (b, d, and f) NBP driven by varying turnover rate (

   <sub class="sub">eco</sub>) only on timescales of 2‐10 years (a and b), 10‐100 years (c and d), and 100‐1000 years (e and f), respectively. The variance in the time‐series of NBP for a particular timescale (e.g., 2‐10 years) is calculated by integrating the power spectrum of NBP across the range of frequencies. The NPP estimates come from the Community Earth System Model Last Millennium Ensemble (CESM‐LME) full‐forcing simulations over 850‐1849, the NBP driven by NPP only was simulated by the Box‐Model, and the NBP driven by

   <sub class="sub">eco</sub> was taken to be the difference between estimates of NBP from the CESM‐LME and the Box‐Model.
