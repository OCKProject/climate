  <p class="p">Spectra for the global annual (a, c, and e) net biome production (NBP) and (b d, and f) heterotrophic respiration (RH) over the period 850‐1849 simulated by Community Earth System Model Last Millennium Ensemble (CESM‐LME; top row), the Box‐Model (middle row), and the differences between the two models (bottom row). The NBP (or RH) simulated by the CESM‐LME full‐forcing runs was driven by both NPP and varying turnover rate (
