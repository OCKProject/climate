 <caption class="caption">
  <p class="p">The responses in the global annual net biome production (NBP), net primary production (NPP), heterotrophic respiration (RH), and disturbance (D), and mean land surface temperature (T), precipitation (P), and shortwave downwelling radiation (R) to 18 large volcanic eruptions as simulated in the Community Earth System Model Last Millennium Ensemble (CESM‐LME) full‐forcing simulations. The left panel shows the anomalies in global C fluxes and in mean T during the periods of five years before and after the volcanic eruption event year. The colored curves are shown for four significant eruptions, and the black curve with gray region shows the mean across the 18 eruptions ± one standard deviation The right panel shows scatter‐plots of the anomalies changes during the overall volcanic eruption events (summed from event year to three years after the event year) against the strength of volcanic eruptions (measured in estimated aerosol emissions).</p>
