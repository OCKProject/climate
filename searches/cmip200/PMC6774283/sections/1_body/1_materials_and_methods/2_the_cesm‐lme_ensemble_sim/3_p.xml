<p class="p">The CESM‐LME ensemble provides 13 simulations with all forcings (hereafter termed the “full‐forcing” run) and smaller ensembles with each transient forcing separately (hereafter referred to as the “single‐forcing” runs) with five simulations for volcanic eruptions, four for the solar forcing, and three for the other forcings from 850 to 2005. All ensemble simulations used the model state in the final year of an “850 control simulation” as the initial conditions; this control simulation ran from year 651 to 2005 with all external forcings being kept at their levels for the year 850 over the entire simulation period (Figure

In the single‐forcing runs, all other forcings were also kept at their levels for the year 850 over the entire period. Ensemble spreads were generated using small random round‐off differences in the initial atmospheric state (Otto‐Bliesner et al.,

The ensemble outputs used here were the annual terrestrial NBP, NPP, RH, D, all carbon pools (in the vegetation and soil), and land surface climate variables. Ensemble means for all the full‐forcing or single‐forcing simulations were calculated in order to reduce uncertainties arising from climate internal variability at long‐term timescales, when focusing on the effects of external forcings.
