<p class="p">Theoretically, as is shown in Figure

 <xref rid="jame20902-fig-0009" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9</xref>), as the fluctuations in NPP on a given timescale will be more offset by variation in RH of opposite sign, with minimal impact on the variability of NBP on this timescale, it implies that the rate of C sequestration would decline during the transition period (Luo &amp; Weng, 
 <xref rid="jame20902-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>); thereby, the newly input carbon into ecosystem carbon pool is retained for a shorter timescale (Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20902-fig-0009" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9</xref>). Factors affecting the change of C turnover rate include changes to ambient temperature or soil moisture. Climate changes impacting upon RH exist on various timescales, including such as the decomposition of the older soil carbon substrates that were accumulated on centennial to longer timescales. For example, the warm MCA, as modeled by the CESM‐LME, shows higher turnover rate and smaller carbon stock over boreal temperate forests than the cool LIA (Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20902-fig-0008" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref>). Because of the larger climatological temperature sensitivity of soil organic carbon and larger soil organic carbon storage in cold‐climate areas (Koven et al., 
 <xref rid="jame20902-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>), changes in the carbon turnover rate due to climate change may become more important over cold and temperate latitudes than the tropical regions on centennial timescales.
