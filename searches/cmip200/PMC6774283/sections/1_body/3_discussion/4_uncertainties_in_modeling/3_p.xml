<p class="p">Therefore, it would be useful if our results were tested further by additional analysis including more models (e.g., from the PMIP or the CMIP), especially those that include more biochemical or biophysical processes such as the peatland and permafrost. This must be contrasted by the additional difficulties in conducting such ensemble simulations (e.g., ensuring all key model inputs are identical) and in its interpretation (given the different assumptions, parameterizations, and components of the individual models). The last millennium simulations from the PMIP or the CMIP, for instance, could be used as climate forcing for DGVMs (e.g., from TRNEDY project). This would give a spread of uncertainties that catches both climate model uncertainty, and DGVM uncertainty.</p>
