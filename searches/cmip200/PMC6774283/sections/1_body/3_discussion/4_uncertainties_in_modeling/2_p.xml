<p class="p">In this study, although ensemble simulations from one model were performed to reduce uncertainties from model initialization, uncertainties represented by intermodel comparisons remain important; we now list some of the key uncertainties and how they may impact upon the findings. Firstly, the land surface model of the CESM (CLM4CN) was reported to underestimate the total soil C pool size compared to the observations and the other ESMs and thus overestimate its turnover rate especially over the NH (He et al., 
 <xref rid="jame20902-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). This would exacerbate uncertainties in our analysis of spatial patterns of C fluxes. Secondly, the CESM‐LME lacks the negative forcing from indirect aerosol effects, resulting in a overestimation of anthropogenic climate warming (Lehner et al., 
 <xref rid="jame20902-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Thirdly, we should also note that the land model (CLM4CN) in CESM‐LME lacks the processes to describe the high latitude permafrost carbon reservoir, which contains a large amount of organic carbon matter frozen in the soil. Large areas of the permafrost are also frozen peatlands over such as Canada and Siberia. With temperatures increasing during the last 150 years, these areas may become a large source of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>, as the thawing of permafrost could result in microbial decomposition of frozen organic carbon (Schuur et al., 
 <xref rid="jame20902-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). However, there remains uncertainty over the current decomposition rate of frozen organic carbon (Dutta et al., 
 <xref rid="jame20902-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>; Schuur et al., 
 <xref rid="jame20902-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). This positive feedback of soil carbon respiration to global warming is important on centennial to millennial timescales (Schuur et al., 
 <xref rid="jame20902-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). The sink of atmosphere CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> from peatlands is estimated to be significant (Spahni et al., 
 <xref rid="jame20902-bib-0066" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>), but the decomposition of peatland/permafrost organic carbon was not parameterized in the CESM‐LME. Additionally, model structural uncertainty remains an important issue, which determines the influence of the simulated internal climate variability and external forcings over the last millennium (Lehner et al., 
 <xref rid="jame20902-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). For instance, the CLM4‐CN in CESM‐LME is simplified with only one soil C layer that induces uncertainties and/or inaccuracies in the results of this work (Oleson et al., 
 <xref rid="jame20902-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Bringing in more soil C layers in future CLM version will increase the heterogeneity in response times as, for example, temperature and soil moisture varies with soil depth, which would present more details of soil respiration. Volcanoes have strong effects on global temperature, precipitation, and the carbon cycle, but large differences between Earth system models exist due to different representations of the response of terrestrial vegetation to climate (Friedlingstein et al., 
 <xref rid="jame20902-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>; Lehner et al., 
 <xref rid="jame20902-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>).
