<p class="p">This study also has a bearing on various geoengineering techniques proposed to mitigate some of the effects of anthropogenic climate change; such proposals require a high degree of scrutiny in terms of their likely impact upon all elements of the earth system. Injection of sulphate aerosols into the stratosphere (mimicking the effect of large volcanoes) has been canvassed as a means of solar radiation management (Vaughan &amp; Lenton, 
 <xref rid="jame20902-bib-0069" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). The large volcanic eruptions during the PILM offer a natural laboratory for the study of such interventions. Our findings suggest that significant volcanic eruptions cause negative anomalies in both temperature and NBP over 2‚Äê3 years, the latter of which may lead to an increase in ambient CO
