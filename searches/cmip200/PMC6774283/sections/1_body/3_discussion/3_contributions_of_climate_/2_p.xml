<p class="p">We find that climate‐internal variability dominates the variability in NBP on interannual to multidecadal timescales, which is consistent to previous studies (Bauska et al., 
 <xref rid="jame20902-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>; Sitch et al., 
 <xref rid="jame20902-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>; Zhang et al., 
 <xref rid="jame20902-bib-0077" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>). The spectral analysis of NBP over 850‐1849 shows strong periodic peaks of around 4 years and 50 years. A similar result was found for interannual variability in another ensemble of land carbon models (TRENDY), which were forced by observational climate data over 1901‐2010, albeit over a much shorter period (Zhang et al., 
 <xref rid="jame20902-bib-0077" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>). The spectrum for the TRENDY ensemble demonstrates periodic peaks at about 2.5, 4, and 30 years with much smaller peak values (e.g., about 6 (PgC)
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>/year
 <sup class="sup">‐2</sup> at the period of 4 years) compared to the CESM‐LME NBP spectrum (about 16 (Pg C)
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>/year
 <sup class="sup">‐2</sup> at period of 4 years). These peaks were attributed to ENSO and Pacific Decadal Oscillation climate modes controlling land temperature and precipitation, respectively, suggesting that climate modes modulate the short‐term variance in NBP by temperature and precipitation (Zeng et al., 
 <xref rid="jame20902-bib-0074" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>; Zhang et al., 
 <xref rid="jame20902-bib-0077" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>); the TRENDY ensemble spans 1901‐2010; thus, the differences between the TRENDY and CESM‐LME spectra may reflect differences in forcings (e.g., from GHGs), sampling error (given the short period of TRENDY), or the more accurate constraints on forcings imposed during the late twentieth century. However, the overestimated ENSO‐like periodic peak values in the power spectrum of NBP apparent in the CESM‐LME output can be related to the fact that the amplitude of the ENSO was overestimated in the CESM compared with observations (Otto‐Bliesner et al., 
 <xref rid="jame20902-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>), indicating that large uncertainties remaining in modeling ocean‐atmosphere interactions could translate into large uncertainties in the interannual variability in regional/global terrestrial carbon cycle.
