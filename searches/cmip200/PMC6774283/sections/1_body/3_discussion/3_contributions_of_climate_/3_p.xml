<p class="p">Let us consider how the climate system's external forcings influence the terrestrial carbon cycle under the background climate before the 1850s. To our surprise, the analysis shows that even during the PILM, GHG forcings (subject to both natural feedback and early anthropogenic activity) are identified as the dominant driver of terrestrial carbon cycle on centennial timescales; this forcing explained about 50% of variations in NPP and RH on centennial timescales in the CESM‐LME. While in the real world, the causality operates in both directions (the C pools of the terrestrial biosphere and the atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> levels influencing one another), the ensemble used specified GHGs and thus variation in the biosphere did not impact upon the assumed CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> levels. Although the GHGs and the LULCC are two largest contributors to the long‐term land carbon variability during the industrial period (Le Quéré et al.,

 <xref rid="jame20902-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>), the human‐induced land cover change (only forcing from change in area) contributed relatively little to variations or the trend in the land C sink before the industrial period on centennial timescales, as estimated by previous studies (Kaplan et al.,
