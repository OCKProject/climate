<p class="p">Our findings also have a bearing upon the likely impacts of a reduction in atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> by afforestation (via sequestration of soil C). We found that the global terrestrial C pool remained close to equilibrium at centennial timescales. While the afforestation impact may be significant for regional NBP, our results support taking a conservative view to the likely global effects over very long timescales, especially when one considers the challenge of maintaining such reserves over centuries.
