<p class="p">In this study, we analyzed an ensemble of simulations from a coupled carbon‐climate model (earth system model [ESM]), the Community Earth System Model Last Millennium Ensemble (CESM‐LME) over the period 850‐2005, considering all external forcings together or each of them separately (Otto‐Bliesner et al., 
 <xref rid="jame20902-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). The goal is to gain a better understanding of the response of the carbon cycle in this model to internal climate variability (e.g., temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, and climate modes) and the different external forcings. The CESM‐LME ensemble allows a longer‐term perspective for detection and attribution of the effect of anthropogenic or natural external forcings (Otto‐Bliesner et al.,

Additionally, we compared contributions of the individual external forcings (e.g., greenhouse gases and volcanic eruptions) to terrestrial carbon fluxes on different timescales. Finally, we examined the details of the land carbon cycle between the Medieval Climate Anomaly (950‐1250) and the Little Ice Age (1450‐1849).
