<p class="p">The magnitude of NBP and its response to forcing depends on the ecosystem turnover rate (hereafter defined as 
 <italic class="italic">k</italic>
 <sub class="sub">eco</sub>) of carbon pools in the ecosystems, and on the sensitivity of D and NPP to climate, the latter depending among other things on the biophysical coupling between soil moisture and photosynthesis (Fung et al., 
 <xref rid="jame20902-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>; Luo et al.,

 <xref rid="jame20902-bib-0067" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1992</xref>). The turnover time (the reciprocal of 
 <italic class="italic">k</italic>
 <sub class="sub">eco</sub>) represents the average time a carbon atom spent in the ecosystem, from input through NPP until exit via D or RH. Hence, the turnover time controls the efficiency of an ecosystem to sequester carbon for a given NPP. Averaged over large spatial scales, the turnover time can vary from hundred years (e.g., in boreal forests) and to a few years (e.g., in grasslands, some tropical rainforests, or semiarid regions; Bloom et al.,

 <xref rid="jame20902-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>). Values of turnover rate (
 <italic class="italic">k</italic>
 <sub class="sub">eco</sub>) can also vary in time in response to climate variability over decades to longer periods, which may potentially impact NBP and cause a longer‐term adjustment to the land carbon cycle. To analyze the influences of those external factors on terrestrial carbon uptake on different time scales, here we used the theoretical framework as developed by Zhang et al. (
 <xref rid="jame20902-bib-0077" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>) to estimate the contributions from NPP input and 
 <italic class="italic">k</italic>
 <sub class="sub">eco</sub> to NBP at different timescales. During the PILM period, the carbon‐climate feedback system experienced natural climate internal variability and external forcings; focusing on this period allows us to quantify better the influences of some decadal variations of some climate modes and volcanic eruptions on the terrestrial carbon cycle (e.g., the role of NPP and 
 <italic class="italic">k</italic>
 <sub class="sub">eco</sub> fluctuations on carbon storage).
