<p class="p">The climate system has experienced a global warming of about 0.85°C since 1850, with changes in radiative forcings due to increased long‐lived atmospheric greenhouse gases and changes in aerosols and other forcings (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 
 <xref rid="jame20902-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). The degree of climate warming relates to anthropogenic emissions as well as feedbacks, for example, of the carbon‐cycle‐climate system (Heimann &amp; Reichstein, 
 <xref rid="jame20902-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). For example, the global terrestrial ecosystem acted as a negative carbon‐climate feedback that effectively slowed down global warming by continually sequestering about 30% of anthropogenic CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions during the past 50 years (e.g., Le Quéré et al.,

 <xref rid="jame20902-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Currently, the global terrestrial carbon uptake (hereafter referred to as the net biome production or NBP) is a net sink for atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>; the NBP is affected by many factors related to human activity or climate change, including CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> levels, surface weather (also termed “climate drivers”), land use change, and nutrient availability.
