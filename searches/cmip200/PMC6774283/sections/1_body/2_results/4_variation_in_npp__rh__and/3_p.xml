Regional analysis shows that the variability in the CESM‐LME modeled global NBP is attributable almost exclusively to fluxes in the tropical regions (20°S‐20°N) on interannual to multidecadal timescales, but on centennial timescales is jointly controlled by the tropics (55%) and the area north of 20°N (45%; Figs.
