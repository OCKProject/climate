<p class="p">In the context of discussing variability at different temporal scales, we adopt the following terms for specific timescales: interannual (with a period of 2‐10 years), decadal (10‐100 years), and centennial (100‐1,000 years). To quantify the contributions of NPP, RH, and D to the variability of NBP at different timescales, we calculated the power spectra of the time‐series of global NBP for each of the 13 CESM‐LME full‐forcing simulations over the PILM. The mean of the ensemble of individual power spectra for NBP displays two peaks with periods of around 4 and 50 years, which fall into the interannual and multidecadal timescales, respectively (Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20902-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>a). The spectrum of the NBP time series from the CESM‐LME members displays the strongest amplitude of variation on interannual timescales, namely, at the period of 4 years with a peak value of about 16 (PgC)

 <sup class="sup">‐2</sup> and the period of 50 years with a peak value of about 3 (PgC)
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>/year
 <sup class="sup">‐2</sup>. As seen in the power spectrum for NPP (Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20902-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>b), there is a similar magnitude and location (corresponding to ENSO‐like time‐scales). By contrast, the variances of RH and D are smaller than that of either NPP or NBP (Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20902-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>), as the sum of variance of RH and D over timescales of 2‐10 year is less than 10% of that of NBP. The peak in the spectrum for D also corresponds to an ENSO‐like timescale (Figures

 <xref rid="jame20902-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>d). This may be driven by variation in biomass burning in semiarid ecosystems associated with major climate modes (O'Donnell et al.,
