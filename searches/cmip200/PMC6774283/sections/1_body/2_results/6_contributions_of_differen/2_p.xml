<p class="p">It should be noted that the NBP is not only driven by the main components of terrestrial ecosystem (i.e., NPP, RH+D, or 
 <italic class="italic">k</italic>
 <sub class="sub">eco</sub>) but also affected by forcings external to the terrestrial ecosystem in the ESM, such as temperature; precipitation; radiation, which impact upon plant photosynthesis and respiration (i.e., NPP); and soil respiration (i.e., RH), and these effects may also vary across timescales. We investigate in this section the contributions of key external forcings (GHGs, LULCC, orbital, solar, and volcanic) to variability in NBP on different timescales over the PILM (Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20902-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). Compared to the full‐forcing and the 850‐year control runs, the power spectra of the single‐forcing simulations of global NBP do not show significant differences across all timescales (Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20902-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>a). However, the variances at low frequency (timescales of 100 to 1,000 years) of global NPP and RH display clearer differences between the single‐forcing and full forcing simulations over the PILM of 850‐1849. These differences generally increase with decreasing frequency (i.e., increasing in timescale), varying from roughly 0.5 to 5.0 (Pg C)

 <xref rid="jame20902-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>c). Variance associated with variation in GHG concentrations dominates the differences (51%) on the timescales of 100 to 1,000 years, followed by volcanic eruptions (25% for NPP and 31% for RH) and LULCC (9% for NPP and 5% for RH). The other forcings (orbital, solar, and volcanic) have much smaller contributions (15% for NPP and 13% for RH) (Figures

 <xref rid="jame20902-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>d). Unsurprisingly, the LULCC forcing is the largest contributor to centennial‐scale variability in D (Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20902-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>d). Overall variation in GHG concentrations has the strongest impact upon variability in global NBP across timescales of &gt;200 years (Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20902-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>b and 
 <xref rid="jame20902-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>c), while volcanic eruptions over the PILM are the most important external factors on interannual to multidecadal timescales, which amplify the decadal‐to‐multidecadal variability of NPP and RH resulting from GHG forcing in the CESM‐LME (Figures 
 <xref rid="jame20902-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> and
