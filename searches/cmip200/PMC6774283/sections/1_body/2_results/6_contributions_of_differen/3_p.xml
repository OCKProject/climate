<p class="p">The modeled global NBP shows significant responses to the series of large volcanic eruptions during the PILM (Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20902-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>a). We selected the largest 18 volcanic eruptions, of which the total reconstructed stratospheric volcanic sulfate aerosol injections (hereafter defined as the strength of volcanic eruptions) are more than 30 Tg (the amount of the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption; Gao et al., 
 <xref rid="jame20902-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). At interannual timescales, we found that the duration of the fast responses in land C fluxes to these volcanic eruptions is approximately limited to 3 years (Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20902-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>). On the year of the volcanic eruption (event year), the modeled NBP presents a positive anomaly (i.e., a larger sink; Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20902-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>a) mainly because of negative RH anomalies due to decreased surface/soil temperature (Figures 
 <xref rid="jame20902-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>c and 
 <xref rid="jame20902-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>e); because volcanic aerosols in the stratosphere typically reduce the direct solar radiation reaching the lower atmosphere and thus cool the land surface. Neither the modeled global NPP nor D show notable anomalies on the year of the event but show large anomalies in the next 2 years. In the first year after these eruptions (Figures 
 <xref rid="jame20902-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>b–
 <xref rid="jame20902-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>d), the NPP and RH show a negative response compared to a positive response in D, and the magnitudes of these responses increase with the strength of volcanic eruptions (Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20902-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>. shows Tambora in Indonesia: 109.7 Tg in 1815, Kuwae of Vanuatu: 137.5 Tg in 1452, and Samalas in Indonesia: 258 Tg in 1258). The largest eruption in 1258 (the eruption event year) resulted in decreases in the next year (1259) after the eruption event year of about 3.5 and 2.5 Pg C/year
 <sup class="sup">‐1</sup> in NPP and RH, respectively, and an increase of about 0.8 Pg C/year
 <sup class="sup">‐1</sup> in D, in response to decrease of 1.6 °C in land surface temperature in 1259. The modeled global NBP consequently displays a clear negative anomaly (‐1.8 Pg C/year
 <sup class="sup">‐1</sup>) in 1259 (Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20902-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>a). The increased D (Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20902-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>d) in response to large volcanic eruptions may be because such large volcanic aerosol forcings can change atmospheric circulation patterns, which resulted in decreased precipitation in tropical semi‐arid regions and East Asia (see Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20902-fig-0008" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref>e for the Little Ice Age period) and promoted drought and fires frequencies (e.g., Zhuo et al.,
