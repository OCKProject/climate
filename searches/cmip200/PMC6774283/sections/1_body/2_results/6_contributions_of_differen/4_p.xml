<p class="p">We evaluated accumulated anomalies from volcanic eruption event years compared to the subsequent 2 years (Figures

Furthermore, there was no significant correlation between the NBP response and the strength of volcanic eruptions (

Further, we calculated the sensitivity of C fluxes to volcano‐induced cooling in the 3 years following the 18 eruptions (by calculating ΔNBP/ΔT, ΔNPP/ΔT, and ΔRH/ΔT for each eruption). These values are on average all negative for NBP (‐0.62 Pg C · year
 <sup class="sup">‐1</sup> · °C
 <sup class="sup">‐1</sup>), NPP (‐0.66 Pg C · year
 <sup class="sup">‐1</sup> · °C
 <sup class="sup">‐1</sup>), and RH (‐0.77 Pg C · year
 <sup class="sup">‐1</sup> · °C
 <sup class="sup">‐1</sup>). The NBP shows comparable temperature sensitivity as seen for NPP and RH, suggesting that temperature variations are the main driver of short‐term changes in terrestrial carbon fluxes by volcanic eruptions.
