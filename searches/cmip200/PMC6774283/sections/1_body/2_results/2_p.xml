 <xref rid="jame20902-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> shows the time series of global annual NBP, NPP, RH, and D over the period 850‐2005, displayed as the ensemble mean of the 13 CESM‐LME full‐forcing simulations. It was found that the operation of averaging over the individual ensemble members largely dampens the magnitude of fluctuations in the C fluxes; thus, the “mean spectrum of the ensemble” refers to the mean of the individual spectra rather than the spectrum of the ensemble mean that was driven by climate internal variability (Figures

 <xref rid="jame20902-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). This is because the timing and magnitude of climate‐internal variability (e.g., El Niño) in the CESM‐LME are uncorrelated in each simulation with different initial conditions (the detrended time‐series showed correlations of
