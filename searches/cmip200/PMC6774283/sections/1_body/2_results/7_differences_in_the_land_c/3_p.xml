<p class="p">By examining the mean states of the land carbon cycle and climate, comparing the warm MCA (on average of 300 years) and the cool LIA (on average of 400 years), we can estimate long‐term sensitivities of land carbon fluxes to climate and external forcing (e.g., volcanic aerosols, LULCC). The CESM‐LME was found to provide a reasonable representation of the cooling period of the LIA compared with historical proxy‐based reconstructions (Otto‐Bliesner et al., 
 <xref rid="jame20902-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). From the full‐forcing simulations, we found that during the cool LIA, the lower surface temperature mostly occurred over the Northern Hemisphere (NH; north of 30°N), with about ‐0.15 to ‐0.45 °C smaller than the MCA at regional scales (Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20902-fig-0008" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref>d). Total land carbon storage (

 <sub class="sub">eco</sub> during the LIA is 1.6% larger than during the MCA (Figure

 <sub class="sub">eco</sub> in the LIA is 4.8% larger than that in the MCA, which resulted from both increased vegetation and soil C pools (Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20902-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S6</xref>), because during the LIA, the 400‐year averaged NPP has increased (Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20902-fig-0008" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref>b) and relative small changed turnover rate (Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20902-fig-0008" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref>c). But over western Europe, which is mainly covered by croplands at current climate, both

 <sub class="sub">eco</sub> during the LIA is much (‐5.5%) smaller than that in the MCA resulting from much smaller averaged NPP and higher turnover rate (larger soil C decomposition; Figures

 <xref rid="jame20902-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S6</xref>). For the tundra in Northern Russia (across the Arctic Circle), surface temperature during the LIA is about ‐0.5°C lower than the MCA (Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20902-fig-0008" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref>d), resulting in depressed plant growth, which led to decreased NPP and
