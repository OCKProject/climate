<p class="p">Over the last millennium, the Earth's climate experienced a long period of cooler temperatures from 1450 to 1849, often referred as the Little Ice Age (LIA), which was preceded by a period of warmer temperatures from 950‚Äê1250, the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA). Causes of the LIA are not well identified, possibly being related to volcanic eruptions (Crowley, 
 <xref rid="jame20902-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>), decreased solar activity (Crowley, 
 <xref rid="jame20902-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>), orbital parameter changes (Kaufman et al.,

 <xref rid="jame20902-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Nevertheless, analyzing differences between the warm MCA and the cool LIA in the ESM provides some clues to help understand the warming effects of climate change on the future carbon cycle.
