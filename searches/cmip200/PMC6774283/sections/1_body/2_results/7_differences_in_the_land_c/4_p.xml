<p class="p">The CESM‐LME single‐forcing experiments can help identify which external forcings dominate regional changes in climate variables and terrestrial carbon cycle between the LIA and MCA. Results show that changes in temperature between the MCA and the LIA are mostly attributable to the cumulative effect of several huge volcanic eruptions during the LIA (Figure

 <sub class="sub">eco</sub>) over western Europe (Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20902-fig-0008" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref>c). The large changes in shortwave radiation over western Europe (Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20902-fig-0008" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref>f) may be explained by large‐scale land‐atmosphere interactions and vegetation geophysical feedback resulting from major deforestation (Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20902-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S9</xref>c); this caused increased land surface albedo, cooled regional climate, and altered general atmospheric circulation (e.g., increased cloud cover) during the LIA 400‐year period (Pongratz et al.,

 <xref rid="jame20902-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). The stratospheric aerosols from volcanoes may also contribute the reduction in shortwave radiation (Figure 
 <xref rid="jame20902-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S9</xref>f). Overall, using the CESM‐LME, remarkable changes were found in the land carbon cycle over the NH during the LIA, especially across the boreal forests and tundra regions, due to large decreased surface temperature caused by huge volcanic eruptions during the LIA.
