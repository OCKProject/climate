Bold lines are the multi-model averages, shaded areas are the 10–90% expected ranges of the CMIP5 GCMs used in this study. All the results were calculated as the area-weighted global averages, Figure S3: Changes in annual mean relative humidity during 2076-2095 relative to 1986–2005 and multi-model standard deviation (contour) under (a) RCP2.6, (b) RCP4.5 and (c) RCP8.5, and (d) the corresponding spatially averaged over land based on the results of CMIP5 GCMs used, Figure S4: Spatial distributions of the difference between
