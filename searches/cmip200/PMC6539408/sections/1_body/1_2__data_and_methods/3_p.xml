<p class="p">We first calculated daily 
 <italic class="italic">W</italic> during the reference period (1986–2005) and the future period (2006–2095) using daily simulations from 19 CMIP5 GCMs under three Representative Concentration Pathways 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5 (RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively) on each grid. In climatology, the occurrence of at least three consecutive hot days has been defined as a heat wave [

 <xref rid="B25-ijerph-16-01513" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. The number of annual total HWDs, employed to quantify heat wave hazard, is defined as the total days of heat waves in a year. In order to evaluate the influence of humidity on heat waves, we calculated the number of annual total HWDs based on air temperature (hereafter denoted simply as ‘THWDs’) and 
 <italic class="italic">W</italic> (hereafter denoted simply as ‘WHWDs’) considering both temperature and humidity effects, respectively. In this study, a heat wave is considered as daily air temperature/
 <italic class="italic">W</italic> exceeding a given region’s threshold for at least three consecutive days. We calculated the local 95th percentile value of daily air temperature/W per year over the reference period and the threshold is defined as the average of these 95th percentile values.
