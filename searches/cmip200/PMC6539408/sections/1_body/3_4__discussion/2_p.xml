<p class="p">Soil moisture can affect the partitioning of net radiation in latent and sensible heat fluxes, and the lack of it will reduce evaporative cooling and thereby amplify extreme high temperatures. Some modelling studies have postulated a possible impact of soil-moisture deficit and drought on hot extremes [

According to Mora et al., tropical areas have prominently higher soil moisture compared to mid-latitudes, and increasing sensible heat flux amplifies extreme high temperatures at mid-latitudes owing to the lack of soil moisture there [
