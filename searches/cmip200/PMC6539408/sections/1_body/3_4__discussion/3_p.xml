<p class="p">Our initial exploration of differences in the number of heat wave days simulated by WBGT and only temperature independently under the three RCPs has some limitations. A challenge faced by heat wave studies is that no standard definition exists in terms of temperature threshold, metric, and lasting days. We only use the 95th percentile and at least three consecutive days to define a heat wave, and donâ€™t conduct a sensitivity analysis through using a series of percentiles and consecutive days, though the increase in heat wave metrics under global warming is essentially insensitive to the percentile threshold chosen [

 <xref rid="B12-ijerph-16-01513" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. We only evaluate the climatic conditions considering both temperature and humidity effects without taking into the effect of adaptation or vulnerability. Although WBGT has been assessed to have some applicability worldwide, some other heat indexes considering both temperature and humidity effects such as humidex [

 <xref rid="B12-ijerph-16-01513" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>] have not been used in this study. We will carry out research about whether utilizing different heat indices will change heat wave characteristics or not in the near future.
