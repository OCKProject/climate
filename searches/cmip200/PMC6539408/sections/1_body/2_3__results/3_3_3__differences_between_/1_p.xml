<p class="p">In order to evaluate the influence of humidity on heat waves, we subtracted annual total THWDs from annual total WHWDs on each grid cell and illustrated the spatial distributions of MME result during 2076–2095 under all three scenarios (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01513-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>a–c). We can find that annual WHWDs are greater than THWDs over the most global land, especially at the equator and its adjacent regions. By 2076–2095, most regions near the equator would experience about 40–140 WHWDs more than THWDs in a year under RCP4.5. In the mid-latitudes, the discrepant days per year would be somewhat lower at 0–20 or negative under all three scenarios. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01513-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>c displays the variation with latitude of the difference in the number of annual total WHWDs and THWDs during 2076–2095, excluding water grid cells. Results show that the zonally averaged difference between WHWDs and THWDs exerts a decreasing trend from the equator to the middle and high latitudes. The difference in the number of HWDs is very small (almost to zero) in south of 30° S and North of 60° N, and in contrast, the number is approximately between 0 and 70 in the regions within 30° latitude of the equator.
