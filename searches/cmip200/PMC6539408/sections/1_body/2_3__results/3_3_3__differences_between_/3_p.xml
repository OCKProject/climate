<p class="p">We also evaluated temporal variation with latitude of the difference in annual total WHWDs and THWDs under all three scenarios (

Between 2016 and 2095, regions within around 10° latitude of the equator are with large difference (about 40–80 days) in a year under all scenarios, which have high relative humidity and consistently warm temperatures (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijerph-16-01513" class="xref">Supplementary Figure S5c,f,i</xref>), the number of discrepant days is very small due to very low humidity inherently there (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01513-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>e). Analogously, although northern high latitudes (near 60° N) have high relative humidity (

 <xref rid="B31-ijerph-16-01513" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>], owing to having relatively low air temperature, the difference in the number of WHWDs and THWDs is also limited. The above consequences suggest that the estimation of heat wave days based only on temperature may result to an underestimation in humid and warm regions but may have limited effects in arid or cold regions.
