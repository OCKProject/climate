<p class="p">By 2016–2095, the zonally averaged difference in the number of WHWDs and THWDs under RCP2.6 is smaller than the other two scenarios on the whole as less warming (

The largest difference (about 60–80 days) would begin from around 2030 to 2075 under RCP 8.5, which would continue till 2095 under RCP4.5. This is in accord with
