<p class="p">It is worth noting that the number of days under RCP4.5 in the regions within 30° latitude of the equator is more than that under RCP8.5 on the whole, and the variation with latitude of the number under RCP2.6 is similar to that under RCP8.5. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01513-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>e displays the zonally averaged change in annual mean relative humidity during 2076–2095, relative to mean values between 1986 and 2005. We can find that except for a slight increase within 10° N and 20° N, relative humidity would decrease at most latitudes and there would be a larger decrease (that is, a lower relative humidity) under RCP8.5, which could result in less difference in the number of WHWDs and THWDs in the humid tropics than that under RCP4.5. Analogously, the less decrease in relative humidity (that is, a higher relative humidity) in the humid tropics under RCP2.6 contributes to a similar variation to that under RCP8.5.
