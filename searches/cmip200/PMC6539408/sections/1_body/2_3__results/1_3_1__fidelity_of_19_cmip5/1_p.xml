<p class="p">Before examining future changes of heat hazard, we have evaluated CMIP5 models in terms of WBGT climatology in comparison with the ERA-Interim reanalysis. Bias and the Taylor diagram analysis [
 <xref rid="B26-ijerph-16-01513" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>] were used to evaluate model skills (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01513-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). Results show that the annual mean WBGT over global land is well simulated by CMIP5 models (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijerph-16-01513" class="xref">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>), with some differences in areas having large terrain undulations. MME bias is −0.3 °C, with some differences across models. The Taylor diagram used in this study relates two statistical indicators of model fidelity: Spatial standard deviations and correlations, indicating the relative amplitude of the simulated and the reference variations, and the degree of similarity of variation between the two, respectively. Both the standard deviation and correlation of the reference data set are equal to 1. Any deviations from 1 for either of them represent a mismatch of modeled variables from the reference data. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01513-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>c shows that the spatial correlation coefficients of all models are greater than 0.95, and the standard deviations of spatial variability are also very similar to the reanalysis.
