<p class="p">Our study underscores the consideration of humidity effects in defining heat waves and quantifying heat wave hazard, especially in the humid and warm tropics. We find that annual mean 
 <italic class="italic">W</italic> has been increasing over global land since 1986, which is consistent with the increase in surface air temperature despite a decrease in average relative humidity. Although GCMs show larger inter-model variations for the humidity simulation compared to air temperature, multi-model standard deviation of 
 <italic class="italic">W</italic> is smaller than the uncertainty in each variable if analyzed independently. Additionally, the cancelation effect between air temperature and water vapor results in the changes in annual mean 
 <italic class="italic">W</italic> smaller and more spatially uniform than those in annual mean air temperature. Results show that there will be an underestimation of around 40–140 days in the number of heat wave days per year in most regions within 15° latitude of the equator (humid and warm tropics) during 2076–2095 without considering humidity effects. However, the estimation of heat wave days based only on temperature may have limited effects in very arid or cold regions. Our paper emphasizes the importance of humidity effects other than air temperature in defining heat waves in humid and warm regions, and provides scientific information for further humid heat risk assessment.
