<p class="p">On the one hand, a resting human body generates about 100 W of metabolic heat (in addition to any absorbed solar heating) and cannot dissipate heat if the ambient temperature is higher than the optimum body core temperature (near 37 Â°C) owing to the second law of thermodynamics [
 <xref rid="B7-ijerph-16-01513" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. On the other hand, sweating, the main process by which the body transports away the environmental and metabolic heat loads, will become significantly less effective if the environmental relative humidity is high, resulting in heat accumulation in the body [
 <xref rid="B8-ijerph-16-01513" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>] and increases in both morbidity and mortality [
 <xref rid="B5-ijerph-16-01513" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Thus, heat stress can occur in environment of temperatures lower than the optimum body core temperature accompanied by high relative humidity. As pointed out by Mora et al., with increasing relative humidity, the boundary at which temperature becomes deadly decreases, and some mortality events related to heat stress occurred at relatively low temperatures [
 <xref rid="B9-ijerph-16-01513" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. The above-mentioned facts are why a variety of heat stress indices like humidex [
 <xref rid="B10-ijerph-16-01513" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>], apparent temperature [
 <xref rid="B11-ijerph-16-01513" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>], and wet-bulb globe temperature [
 <xref rid="B12-ijerph-16-01513" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>] take both temperature and humidity into consideration.
