<p class="p">Despite the need for effective and scientific information about heat stress considering humidity effects, the assessment and comparative analysis on a global scale has been limited so far. Therefore, this study aims to analyze the future changes in heat wave hazard over global land using multi-model simulations integrated under different greenhouse gas emission scenarios. Here, WBGT was utilized as a heat index and the number of annual total heat wave days (HWDs) was employed to quantify the heat hazard [
 <xref rid="B20-ijerph-16-01513" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. We focus on the spatial distribution and temporal variation of difference in heat hazard simulated by WBGT and only temperature independently in order to evaluate the effects of humidity on heat events.
