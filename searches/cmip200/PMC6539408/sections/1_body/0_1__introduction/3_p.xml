<p class="p">Wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) is the most common index including both temperature and humidity effects to quantify heat stress and has a long history of use. It was invented during the 1950s to control heat illness in training camps of the United States Army and Marine Corps [

 <xref rid="B13-ijerph-16-01513" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. The heat stress index WBGT (°C) is a combination of the black globe temperature (measured inside a 15 cm diameter black globe), the natural wet bulb temperature (measured with a wetted thermometer exposed to the wind and heat radiation at the site), and the air temperature (measured with a “normal” thermometer shaded from direct heat radiation), to take into account the effect of heat absorption from the sun, and evaporative cooling, which is strongly related to air humidity. As ambient WBGT approaches the human body skin temperature, it becomes more difficult for the body to dissipate heat to an environment [
