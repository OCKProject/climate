<p class="p">However, even if cumulative emissions are sufficiently constrained to ensure that global warming is held to 1° to 2°C, many areas are still likely to experience substantial increases in the probability of unprecedented events. At the global scale, hot, cold, wet, and dry extremes all exhibit prominent changes in event probability within the 2°C target, including more than fivefold increases at ~25% of the observed area for warmest night and wettest wet days and more than twofold increases at ~25% of the observed area for hottest day. These changes encompass substantial fractions of the United States, Europe, East Asia, and the southern hemisphere mid-latitudes. For example, &gt;90% of observed locations in those regions exhibit increases in the probability of record-hot days and/or record-warm nights relative to the current climate, and 45 to 100% exhibit increases in probability of the longest dry spell. Further, although much of the tropics lack long-term observational coverage, analyses of climate simulations indicate increases in record hot, wet, and dry events that are at least as substantial as the increases seen over the mid-latitude regions.</p>
