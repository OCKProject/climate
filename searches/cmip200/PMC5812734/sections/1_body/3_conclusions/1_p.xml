<p class="p">Our results provide the first quantitative comparison of the probability of unprecedented climate events in cumulative emissions windows that are consistent with both historical changes and the UN aspirational targets and pledged national commitments. Analysis of cumulative emissions consistent with global warming of 2째 to 3째C shows that the commitments outlined in the UN Paris Agreement are likely to lead to substantial and widespread increases in the probability of historically unprecedented extreme events. For example, 15 to 60% of observed locations in North America, Europe, East Asia, and southern South America exhibit return interval ratios of &gt;3 for most of the extreme indices analyzed here. In contrast, analysis of cumulative emissions consistent with global warming of 1째 to 2째C shows that achieving the more aspirational UN targets is likely to substantially limit those increases.</p>
