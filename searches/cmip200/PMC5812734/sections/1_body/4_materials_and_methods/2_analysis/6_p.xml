 </xref>) includes a bias correction step. As described by Diffenbaugh 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., to evaluate each model’s simulation of interannual variability in each climate index, this bias correction is based on the differences between the detrended observations and the climate simulation without human forcings. First, the climate model mean is corrected to be equal to the observational mean (that is, by subtracting the difference between the climate model mean and the observational mean from the climate model time series). In the current analysis, we corrected each CMIP5 realization individually and then pooled the corrected data into a single “bias-corrected” CMIP5 population. This approach allows us to leverage the variability across the full CMIP5 ensemble while simultaneously controlling for the mean biases of the individual climate models. In addition, the method of Diffenbaugh 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. also controls for errors in the climate model variability by defining the simulated sample of event return intervals to be identical to the observed sample of event return intervals. That sample of event return intervals is then used to define the sample of event magnitudes in the pool of climate model simulations. This approach of defining the sample of simulated event magnitudes based on the sample of observed event return intervals helps to control for the effect of variability biases on event magnitudes in the tail of the simulated distribution.
