<p class="p">We note that Millar 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. (
 <xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">42</italic>
 </xref>) have provided a more recent update of the cumulative emissions-temperature relationship shown in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5). Because they are based on the same underlying CMIP5 simulations that were used to generate the findings in the IPCC AR5, the cumulative emissions windows are similar between the periods presented here and those by Millar 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. For example, the cumulative emissions that Millar 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. identify as having a 66% chance of staying below 1.5°C above the pre-industrial fall close to 2030 of RCP8.5, and the cumulative emissions that Millar 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. identify as having a 66% chance of staying below 0.6°C above the recent decade occur near 2040 of RCP8.5. Further, the cumulative emissions that Millar 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. identify as having a 66% chance of exceeding 1.1°C above the recent decade fall close to 2050 of RCP8.5.
