 </xref>), who compared four attribution metrics during the historical period. To extend the historical analysis of Diffenbaugh 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. to periods of elevated climate forcing, we focused on their fourth metric, which is the ratio of return intervals at lower and higher levels of climate forcing. (For example, an event that has a probability of 0.01—or a return interval of 100 years—in the lower forcing and a probability of 0.05—or a return interval of 20 years—in the higher forcing has a return interval ratio of 5). To account for uncertainty in the return interval of the observed record-level event, a distribution of return interval ratios was calculated at each grid point. To do so, we block bootstrapped the grid point time series at the lower and higher forcing levels to generate two distributions of return intervals; we then calculated ratios between all combinations of bootstrapped return intervals at lower and higher forcing, yielding a distribution of return interval ratios (
