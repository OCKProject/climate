First, because CLIMDEX archived the extreme indices for the CMIP5 HistoricalNat simulations rather than the CMIP5 Pre-Industrial Control simulations, we used the HistoricalNat experiment as the “counterfactual” world without human influence. (The Pre-Industrial Control and HistoricalNat simulations are similar, but whereas the Pre-Industrial Control simulations use constant pre-industrial forcing, the HistoricalNat simulations add the volcanic and solar forcing that occurred during the historical period; the HistoricalNat simulations therefore enable isolation of the anthropogenic forcing during the historical period). We used the 1961–2005 period to calculate the return interval of the most extreme event in both the observations and the HistoricalNat simulations [see the study of Diffenbaugh
