<p class="p">We compared the return interval of the most extreme observed value between the HistoricalNat forcing and three anthropogenic forcing windows: the 1986–2005 period of the Historical simulations, the 2016–2035 period of the RCP8.5 simulations, and the 2036–2055 period of the RCP8.5 simulations. The 1986–2005 period of the Historical simulations is the baseline period used by the IPCC (
