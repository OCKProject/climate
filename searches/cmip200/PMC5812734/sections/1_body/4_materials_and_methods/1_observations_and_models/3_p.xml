<p class="p">CLIMDEX calculated the simulated extreme event indices using output from CMIP5 (
 <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">39</italic>
 </xref>). CLIMDEX has archived indices for the CMIP5 Historical, HistoricalNat, and RCP simulations. We analyzed the climate models for which there are matching realizations in the Historical, HistoricalNat, and RCP8.5 simulations. Following the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), we used the “r1i1p1” realization from each model (
 <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">40</italic>
 </xref>), yielding a total of 15 realizations from 15 models.
