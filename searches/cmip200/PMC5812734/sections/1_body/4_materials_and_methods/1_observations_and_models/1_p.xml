<p class="p">The CLIMDEX project has archived globally gridded extreme event indices for both historical observations and climate model simulations of historical and future forcing trajectories (
 <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">29</italic>
 </xref>, 
 <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">32</italic>
 </xref>). We analyzed eight of the CLIMDEX indices: (i) hottest maximum daily temperature of the year (TXx), (ii) warmest minimum daily temperature of the year (TNx), (iii) coldest minimum daily temperature of the year (TNn), (iv) number of days with maximum temperature below 0Â°C (ID0), (v) annual precipitation from days that exceed the 95th percentile (R95p), (vi) wettest day of the year (Rx1day), (vii) total annual precipitation (PRCPTOT), and (viii) longest consecutive dry spell of the year (CDD).
