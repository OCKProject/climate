<p class="p">We applied the methods of Diffenbaugh

 <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">22</italic>
 </xref>) to calculate the probability of exceeding the most extreme observed value of each of these eight indices. For these indices, “exceeding the most extreme observed value” means hotter than the maximum TXx value (“hottest day”), warmer than the maximum TNx value (“warmest night”), warmer than the maximum TNn value (“mildest cold night”), fewer days than the minimum ID0 value (“mildest freeze length”), wetter than the maximum R95p value (“wettest wet days”), wetter than the maximum Rx1day value (“wettest day”), drier than the minimum PRCPTOT value (“driest year”), and longer than the maximum CDD value (“longest dry spell”).
