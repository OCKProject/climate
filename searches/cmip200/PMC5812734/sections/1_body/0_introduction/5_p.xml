<p class="p">Although numerous studies and assessments have examined the response of extreme events to changes in climate forcing (

 </xref>), our analyses expand on these previous efforts in a number of ways. First, we compare the influence of human forcing on the probability of unprecedented extremes for multiple metrics, both during the historical period and for future periods consistent with the UN cumulative emissions budgets. This comparison enables quantification of the level of adaptation—in terms of increased climate risk—that will be required if different targets are achieved and of the value—in terms of avoided climate risk—associated with different levels of emissions mitigation.
