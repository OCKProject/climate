<p class="p">Differences in the mean climate between the UN cumulative emissions targets and the UN cumulative emissions commitments could be large enough to affect natural and human systems (

  <italic class="italic">7</italic>
 </xref>). However, for a number of reasons, it is likely that the highest-impact differences between the UN targets and commitments will be driven by differences in the response of extreme events. First, when observing the historical record, it is clear that the most acute climate vulnerabilities are associated with extremes (

  <italic class="italic">8</italic>
 </xref>–
 <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">10</italic>
 </xref>). These vulnerabilities are seen across human and natural systems, including both wealthy and poor communities, and both terrestrial and marine ecosystems (

 </xref>). Second, assessments of the potential impacts of future climate change identify changes in the frequency and/or intensity of extremes as a primary driver of future risks (

 </xref>–
 <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">13</italic>
 </xref>). This is particularly true for smaller increases in climate forcing, where small changes in the mean can create high-impact changes in extremes (

 </xref>–
 <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">18</italic>
 </xref>). Comparing potential impacts between the UN targets and commitments therefore requires rigorous, observationally based quantification of changes in the likelihood of extremes (
