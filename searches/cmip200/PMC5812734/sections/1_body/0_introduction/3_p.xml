 <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">22</italic>
 </xref>). For example, the magnitudes of many recent record-setting events have been particularly extreme relative to the length of available historical observations. The limited observational sample, combined with the nonstationarity of the historical time series, creates numerous challenges for quantifying the true underlying variability and hence the true probability of the record event (

 </xref>). Those near-term decadal time scales exhibit substantial ambiguity between the signal of climate forcing and the noise of climate variability, particularly on the regional and local scales at which extreme events occur (
