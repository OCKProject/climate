<p class="p">Despite these methodological challenges, the distinct risks posed by unprecedented events create a pressing need to quantify their probabilities at cumulative emissions levels consistent with the UN targets and commitments. We therefore extend the methods of Diffenbaugh

 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. focused exclusively on the historical period using a single climate model, we extend their methods to quantify the probability of record-setting hot, cold, wet, and dry extremes at all available observational grid points, using multiple climate models, for both historical climate forcing and future forcing windows. These future forcing windows are selected to be consistent with global warming of ~1째 to 2째C and ~2째 to 3째C, allowing us to quantify the differing risks of unprecedented climate extremes associated with the UN aspirational targets versus the UN NDC commitments (
