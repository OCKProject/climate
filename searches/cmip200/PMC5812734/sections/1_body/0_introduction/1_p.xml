<p class="p">Recognition of the proportional relationship between cumulative carbon emissions and global temperature change represents one of the most important insights of climate science during the past decade (

 </xref>). Given the structure of the Paris Agreement, there is a specific need to compare the levels of cumulative emissions identified in the nationally determined contributions (NDCs; which represent the actual country commitments) and the more aspirational targets of “aggregate emission pathways in order to hold the increase in global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels” (
