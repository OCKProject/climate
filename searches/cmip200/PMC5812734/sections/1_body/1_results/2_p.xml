<p class="p">Across the eight extreme indices, the probability of the warmest night exhibits the most widespread response to increasing forcing, with almost half of the global-scale return interval ratios exceeding 5 for cumulative emissions consistent with 2° to 3°C of global warming (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1B</xref>). [In this case, a ratio of 5 means that cumulative emissions of ~3500 gigatons (GT) of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> increase the probability of exceeding the historical maximum warmest night by a factor of 5 relative to the world without human influence.] The hottest day, mildest cold night, and mildest freeze length also exhibit substantial sensitivity, with approximately a quarter of the global-scale return interval ratios exceeding 5 for cumulative emissions consistent with 2° to 3°C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>, A, C, and D). Wet events show more widespread sensitivity than dry events, with more than a quarter of the global-scale return interval ratios exceeding 5 for both extreme wet metrics (wettest day and wettest wet days) for cumulative emissions consistent with 2° to 3°C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>, E and F). In contrast, although both the driest year and the longest dry spell already exhibit increases in probability in the current climate, they exhibit little additional increase in global extent for cumulative emissions consistent with either 1° to 2°C or 2° to 3°C (
