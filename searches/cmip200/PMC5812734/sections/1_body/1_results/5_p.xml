<p class="p">As with temperature extremes, large fractions of the observed area already exhibit increased probability of record-level wet events, including ≥70% of the available data points in North America, Europe, East Asia, southern South America, and Australia for both extreme wet metrics (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>, A and D). The fraction of available points that exhibit increases in probability of record-level wet events expands for cumulative emissions consistent with 1° to 2°C of global warming (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>, B and E). However, the intensification of wet event probability is substantially greater for cumulative emissions consistent with 2° to 3°C, with 15 to 60% of the available data points in North America, Europe, East Asia, and southern South America exhibiting ratios of &gt;3 (relative to Historical) for both metrics (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>, C and F). We note that the increases in probability are generally more substantial and widespread for the fraction of total precipitation falling in wet days (“wettest wet days”) than for the magnitude of the wettest single day of the year (“wettest day”). This difference suggests that the risk of increasing extreme wet events is greater than what is indicated by the wettest single event and can occur across a broader range of the precipitation distribution—and therefore potentially result in more sustained wet conditions.
