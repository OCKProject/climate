<p class="p">The historical forcing has already increased the probability of both the hottest day and the warmest night over most of the observational area (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>, A and D, and fig. S2). For the hottest day, the historical forcing has increased the probability relative to natural forcings (that is, ratios &gt;1) for more than half of the available data points in East Asia (56.3%), more than two-thirds in North America (70.9%), and more than three-quarters in Europe (76.7%), Australia (82.4%), and southern South America (85%). The historical increases are even more widespread for the warmest night, with ≥90% of the available data points in North America, Europe, Australia, and southern South America exhibiting ratios of &gt;1, and almost 10% in East Asia exhibiting ratios of &gt;3. Exceeding 2°C of global warming increases the probability of the hottest day substantially. For example, whereas less than 10% of the available data points in Europe exhibit hottest day ratios of &gt;3 (relative to Historical) for cumulative emissions consistent with 1° to 2°C of global warming, more than half (51.7%) exhibit ratios of &gt;3 for cumulative emissions consistent with 2° to 3°C. Similarly, in East Asia, the median hot day ratio remains below 3 (relative to Historical) for all available data points for cumulative emissions consistent with 1° to 2°C of global warming, but more than a quarter of those data points (28.6%) exhibit ratios of &gt;3 for cumulative emissions consistent with 2° to 3°C.
