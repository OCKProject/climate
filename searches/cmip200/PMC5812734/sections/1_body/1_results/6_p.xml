<p class="p">Compared with hot, cold, and wet events, increases in extreme dry probabilities are less widespread (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Figs. 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">5</xref>). This discrepancy is caused primarily by the fact that substantial areas experience decreasing probability of both the driest year and the longest dry spell (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>). These areas of decreasing dry probabilities are concentrated in the high latitudes, where precipitation increases are most robust (

 </xref>). However, the fact that continued increases in cumulative emissions do not cause substantial increases in extreme dry probabilities at the global scale (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>) does not mean that the probability of dry events is not responsive to increasing forcing. Large fractions of the northern and southern hemisphere mid-latitudes exhibit increasing probability of eclipsing the historically driest year and longest dry spell (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>). These include many areas that are currently heavily populated and highly vulnerable, such as the Mediterranean, southern Africa, Southeast Asia, and southern South America. Not only have increases in event probability already emerged over most of these regions, but also continued emissions substantially intensify the regional increases. Regional intensification is particularly strong for the longest dry spell, with areas of North America, Europe, southern South America, and southern Africa exhibiting higher probability of record-setting events for cumulative emissions consistent with 2° to 3°C of global warming than 1° to 2°C of global warming (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>, E and F). The fact that increases in probability are generally more substantial and widespread for the longest dry spell of the year (“longest dry spell”) than for the minimum annual precipitation (“driest year”) suggests that the risk of increasing extreme dry conditions is greater at subannual than annual time scales and that the probability of prolonged dry conditions within the year can increase even if the probability of the driest year does not.
