<p class="p">The CLIMDEX project has archived a suite of globally gridded observed and simulated extreme event indices (
 <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">29</italic>
 </xref>, 
 <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">32</italic>
 </xref>). We analyze eight of the CLIMDEX indices, which together provide two metrics each for hot, cold, wet, and dry extremes [
