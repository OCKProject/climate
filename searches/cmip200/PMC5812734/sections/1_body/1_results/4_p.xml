<p class="p">The probability that the coldest events of the year become more mild also increases substantially as cumulative emissions increase (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>). Most of high-latitude Eurasia and North America have already experienced increased probability that the coldest night of the year exceeds the mildest value on record (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Fig. 3A</xref>). These increases in probability intensify at higher levels of forcing, with return interval ratios of &gt;2 (relative to Historical) for cumulative emissions consistent with 1° to 2°C of global warming (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Fig. 3B</xref>), and ratios of &gt;3 for cumulative emissions consistent with 2° to 3°C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Fig. 3C</xref>). Areas of high-latitude Eurasia and North America also exhibit particularly strong increases in the probability of the mildest freeze length, including return interval ratios of &gt;4 (relative to Historical) over large areas of Eurasia for cumulative emissions consistent with 2° to 3°C (
