<p class="p">Our analyses also provide an important comparison with the historical attribution analyses of Diffenbaugh 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. (
 <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">22</italic>
 </xref>). First, we extend the number of extreme event metrics from four in the study of Diffenbaugh 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. to eight in the current analysis. Second, whereas Diffenbaugh 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. did not differentiate human and natural forcings during the historical period, our analysis isolates the human component of the historical climate forcing. Third, whereas Diffenbaugh 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. used many realizations of a single climate model [the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) “Large Ensemble”], our analysis spans a larger range of uncertainty by analyzing results from multiple climate models.
