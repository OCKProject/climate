<p class="p">We note a number of important considerations when evaluating our results. One is that although the CMIP5 ensemble accurately simulates the observed variability of most of the extreme indices over most areas, there are areas of disagreement (fig. S1). Although our methodology does use the observed uncertainty in the probability of the record-setting event to implicitly correct errors in the climate model probability (see Materials and Methods), the regions where the climate model ensemble does not accurately simulate the observed variability (fig. S1) should be treated with caution.</p>
