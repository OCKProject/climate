<p class="p">We can provide some estimation of the change in probability in these regions by calculating how often the maximum/minimum value of the CMIP5 natural forcing (“HistoricalNat”) simulations is exceeded in the CMIP5 historical and future scenarios (figs. S3 to S6). These occurrence frequencies suggest that areas lacking observational coverage are also likely to exhibit substantial increases in the probability of events that fall outside of the historical range. For example, for cumulative emissions consistent with 2° to 3°C of global warming, the occurrence of the hottest day and wettest day is more than five times the recent historical occurrence over most of tropical South America and tropical Africa (figs. S3 and S5). Likewise, for cumulative emissions consistent with both 2° to 3°C and 1° to 2°C, the occurrence of the driest year and longest dry spell is more than three times the recent historical occurrence over substantial fractions of tropical South America and tropical Africa (fig. S6).</p>
