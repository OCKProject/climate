<p class="p">The conservativeness of our statistical methodology is another reason that our results provide a lower bound on the probability of unprecedented climate events at different levels of forcing identified by global policy-makers. In particular, our methodology selects a parametric distribution that minimizes the return interval ratio (

 </xref>–

 </xref>). This comparison shows that our results do exhibit smaller changes than those calculated based on thresholds from the models themselves. However, it should be reiterated that our method allows calculation of the uncertainty in the probability of the actual observed record-setting event based on the statistics of the observed distribution (
