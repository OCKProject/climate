<p class="p">In addition, because our methodology is built around the observed statistics of each extreme climate indicator, analyses are limited to areas with observational coverage in the CLIMDEX data set (
 <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">22</italic>
 </xref>). Areas that lack observational coverage could exhibit substantial changes in the probability of record-setting events, particularly in the tropics, where the mean warming has been large relative to the historical variability (
 <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">21</italic>
 </xref>, 
 <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">34</italic>
 </xref>, 
 <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">35</italic>
 </xref>). Not only would inclusion of these areas alter the global-scale CDFs shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>, but also many of these areas coincide with large human populations, high human vulnerability, and/or high biodiversity, whose exposure to changing extreme event probabilities is not represented in our results due to the lack of observational coverage.
