In contrast, our emphasis on quantitatively comparing historical and future changes makes spanning both internal variability and model structural uncertainty a key requirement. As shown by Diffenbaugh 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., the historical global warming in the NCAR Large Ensemble falls in the lower half of the CMIP5 multimodel ensemble. Therefore, by using many climate models, our current analysis spans a far greater range of climate sensitivity, which is crucial for comparing climate risks associated with the UN targets versus the UN NDC commitments. Likewise, given the potential for systematic errors in the simulation of the atmosphere and ocean circulation to create errors in the simulated response of temperature and precipitation to changes in forcing (
