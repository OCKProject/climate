  <title class="title">The change in probability of exceeding the historically unprecedented hot event at three levels of forcing.</title>
  <p class="p">Maps show the median value of the bootstrapped return interval ratios between the lower and higher forcing. (Full distributions for all grid points are shown in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>). For ratios reported as “relative to Natural,” the lower forcing is that for a world without human influence; for ratios reported as “relative to Historical,” the lower forcing is the combined human and natural forcing that occurred during the historical period (see Materials and Methods). (
   <bold class="bold">A</bold> to 
   <bold class="bold">C</bold>) Median return interval ratio for the hottest maximum daily temperature of the year (maximum TXx value; “hottest day”). (
   <bold class="bold">D</bold> to 
   <bold class="bold">F</bold>) Median return interval ratio for the warmest minimum daily temperature of the year (maximum TNx value; “warmest night”). As described in Materials and Methods, the analysis is limited to the areas with observed values in the CLIMDEX data set (missing areas shown in white; fig. S1). See fig. S2 for regional boundaries used in the regional summary calculations.
