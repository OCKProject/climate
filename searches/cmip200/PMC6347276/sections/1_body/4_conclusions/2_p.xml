<p class="p">Stochastic fire occurrence dampens the sudden increases in area with fire, and total area burned simulated under unlimited ignitions. As a result, C pools are more stable through time under stochastic fire occurrence than under unlimited ignitions. The stark differences between results for unlimited ignitions and those for stochastic fire occurrence point to the need for further research regarding fire occurrence algorithms in DGVMs. Areas for further research include: the addition of ignition source probabilities to guide the location of fire occurrence; fire spread which would allow modeling large fires across grid cells; inclusion of land use and land cover to shape both the occurrence and spread of fire; and the elimination of fire return intervals from fire algorithms in order to model fire occurrence and extent from physical parameters and stochastic events without imposed limitations.</p>
