<p class="p">These projections underscore ongoing challenges for resource managers who must balance the possibly competing concerns of wildfire, forest condition, wildlife management, carbon sequestration, high potential for vegetation change, and a variety of ecosystem services including clean water and air. Nonetheless, this study and its conclusions should be taken in a broader context. MC2 is one of many models suitable to explore the possible futures of this region. Given the regionâ€™s ecological and economic importance, extensive monitoring is warranted to provide insight into the state of the forests, possibly confirming or refuting signs of stress, vegetation change, and ecological threshold exceedance.</p>
