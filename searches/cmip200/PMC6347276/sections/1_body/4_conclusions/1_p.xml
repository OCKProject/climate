<p class="p">For the area west of the Cascade Crest in Oregon and Washington, we found assumptions about CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fertilization effects and fire occurrence in the MC2 DVGM have substantial effects on simulated carbon dynamics. Without fire, CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fertilization increases C stocks, while the lack of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fertilization leads to decreases in C stocks. For scenarios with fire, CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fertilization mitigates projected C losses due to fire, limiting decreases over the 20
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> and 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> centuries by a factor of 4 versus scenarios without CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fertilization.
