<p class="p">In the Hudiburg datasets, we set densities of carbon in human-affected (HA) cells to 0 before resampling to the 1/24 degree grid used in our simulation. We adjusted carbon densities from our simulation results by multiplying the results by the ratio of NHA area to the total grid cell area. We similarly adjusted results for validation against the MTBS [
