<p class="p">We compared fire results, carbon dynamics, and vegetation change among modeled scenarios. For fire, we compared three results: 1) area with fire (AWF)–the total area of grid cells burned; 2) fraction area burned (FAB)–fraction of area burned in grid cells with fire; and 3) total area burned (TAB), the sum of (AWF * FAB) over all grid cells.</p>
