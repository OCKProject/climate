<p class="p">MC2 does not simulate species, but instead simulates combinations of life forms in functional vegetation types. Woody lifeforms (trees and shrubs) are distinguished by leaf phenology (evergreen vs. deciduous) and morphology (needleleaf vs. broadleaf). The woody lifeforms and the relative dominance of C3 versus C4 grasses (including sedges and forbs) are simulated using climate thresholds. Carbon thresholds are used to distinguish broad vegetation types ranging from forest to grassland.</p>
