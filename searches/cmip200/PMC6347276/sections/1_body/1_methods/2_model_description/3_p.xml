<p class="p">The fire module simulates fire occurrence and fire effects including area burned, mortality, consumption of aboveground biomass, carbon emissions, and nitrogen volatilization. Fire occurrence is simulated as a discrete event. The module runs on a pseudo-daily time step and derives a randomly distributed set of daily precipitation amounts from monthly precipitation values. Fuel types are derived from carbon stocks, and their characteristics are determined by weather effects on their moisture content (see [
 <xref rid="pone.0210989.ref001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>] for a detailed description). Per vegetation type fire return intervals (FRIs) and time since last fire are used to limit the maximum portion of a grid cell burned. Fire occurrence is based on fuel condition thresholds and assumed unlimited ignitions. Fire suppression is simulated by assuming fires below empirical fuel condition thresholds can be extinguished while those above cannot.
