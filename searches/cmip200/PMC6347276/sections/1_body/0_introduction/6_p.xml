<p class="p">In this study, we evaluate uncertainty due to model assumptions regarding fire occurrence and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>-driven WUE. We compare results from unlimited ignitions and fixed fuel thresholds to those with stochastic ignition occurrence and ignition propagation based on fuel conditions. We also compare results obtained with and without CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fertilization effect. We address the following research questions concerning vegetation and carbon dynamics in the MC2 DGVM:
