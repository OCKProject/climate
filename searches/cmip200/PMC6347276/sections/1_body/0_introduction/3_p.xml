<p class="p">Another source of uncertainty is the complex relationship between fire and vegetation, which takes place over a range of spatial and temporal scales [

 <xref rid="pone.0210989.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]). The type and level of complexity of fire models adequate for management-relevant vegetation modeling remains unclear [
 <xref rid="pone.0210989.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. Researchers have implemented a variety of models [

While comparing results among DGVMs using different fire models provides one way to characterize uncertainty, modifying the assumptions within a single DGVM’s fire model is another method for sensitivity analysis and the exploration of fire-related uncertainty.
