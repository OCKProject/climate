<p class="p">Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs) are process-based models that simulate vegetation, carbon, nutrient, and hydrological dynamics. They are driven by historical climate data and climate projections from General Circulation Models (GCMs; e.g. [
 <xref rid="pone.0210989.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]) or Earth System Models (ESMs; [
 <xref rid="pone.0210989.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]). Sources of uncertainty in DGVM projections come from both external drivers such as climate and soil characteristics, and internal characteristics such as model structure, empirical parameter values, built-in thresholds, and inherent assumptions and simplifications.
