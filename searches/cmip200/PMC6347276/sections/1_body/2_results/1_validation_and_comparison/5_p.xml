<p class="p">For NF-WCE (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210989.g006" class="xref">Fig 6C</xref>) our simulated AGT carbon density is higher than Hudiburgâ€™s over most of the study area. For FF-WCE (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210989.g006" class="xref">Fig 6D</xref>) our simulated AGT carbon density is generally lower in areas that have experienced fire and higher in areas that have not. Similarly, for SF-WCE, our simulated carbon density is lower in areas having experienced fire, but those areas are greater due to the spatially broader simulated fire occurrence (
