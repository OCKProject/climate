<p class="p">Our simulated AGB ranges from 11 to 57% higher than that modeled by Hudiburg (
 <xref rid="pone.0210989.t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). AGD carbon also ranges from 79 to 105% higher, and AGT carbon ranges from 28 to 68% higher. Among our simulations, AGB, AGD, and AGT are highest for NF-WCE, and lowest for SF-WCE (
 <xref rid="pone.0210989.t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). AGB, AGD, and AGT densities are generally higher and more flatly distributed than Hudiburgâ€™s (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210989.g005" class="xref">Fig 5</xref>). AGB, AGD, and AGT density distributions are flattest for SF-WCE.
