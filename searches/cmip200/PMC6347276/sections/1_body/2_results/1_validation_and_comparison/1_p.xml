<p class="p">For simulations with fire, TAB (total area burned) is 2.3 to 2.8 times observed (
 <xref rid="pone.0210989.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Burned areas for both observed and FF-WCE are concentrated across the southeastern corner of the study area, the central east edge, and the northeastern corner (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210989.g004" class="xref">Fig 4B and 4C</xref>). However, for FF-WCE, fire is simulated in the northernmost central portion of the area (northern Cascades) where it is not observed, and in the southeast fire is less concentrated than observed. For SF-WCE, fire occurrence is also concentrated in the southeastern and northeast (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210989.g004" class="xref">Fig 4D</xref>), but also occurs more frequently throughout non-human-influenced areas than either for observed or FF-WCE, most commonly in the Cascade Mountains, southern Coast Range, and Puget Trough (
