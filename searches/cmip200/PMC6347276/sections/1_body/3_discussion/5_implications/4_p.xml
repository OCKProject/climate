<p class="p">Ecosystem C decreases in all with-fire scenarios indicate that this region will become a carbon source in the future. Decreases may be more pronounced beyond 2100 if the increased C in the dead pool decays at a greater rate than dead C is produced. This is possible as the simulated increase in dead C is due to a sudden increase in fire in forests that had been highly productive, and the live to dead C ratios increase towards previous equilibrium values at the end of the simulation. If the CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> effect is lower than projected or is temporary, with plants adapting to the new CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentrations, carbon losses may be higher than projected under the WCE scenarios, for example, 1.69 Pg C (20%) greater for the FF-NCE than for the FF-WCE. However black carbon accumulation from more frequent fire and the possible slowing of decomposition due to higher evaporative demand in soils may mitigate losses of soil C.
