<p class="p">The live C lost in all with-fire scenarios indicates fire will cause mortality through the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> c. Another indication of future vegetation mortality is the climate-driven transition from needleleaf to temperate mixed to warm mixed forest. MC2 does not simulate mortality, seeding, sprouting, recruitment, and succession associated with forest type change driven by climate alone. So, for example, under a warming climate, the model could shift a forest dominated by needleleaf lifeforms to one dominated by mixed conifer and hardwood lifeforms without simulating mortality and succession. Thus, model results should be interpreted as a suggestion that vegetation will come under stress due to a changing climate. Mortality and vegetation type change would not necessarily be sudden. However, stressed vegetation would be more susceptible to disturbances [
