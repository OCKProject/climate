<p class="p">With or without fire suppression, unlimited ignitions cause a sharp increase in AWF as climate conditions drive fuel conditions over ignition thresholds on a yearly basis during the early and mid 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> c. This is consistent with recent observed increases in wildfire across the western US, including the PNW, due to warming climate [

 <xref rid="pone.0210989.ref052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]. The initial decrease in FAB and TAB as AWF remains high is due to the dependency of FAB on the combination of time since last fire and fire return interval (FRI) in addition to fuel conditions. The longer a cell does not burn, the greater the fraction of that cell that can burn. With the initial transition to more frequent fires, the first fire in a cell burns a greater cell portion than subsequent fires in the same cell. The vegetation shift to subtropical mixed forest, which has a higher ignition threshold, contributes to decreased AWF, FAB, and TAB towards the end of the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> c. The higher fuel thresholds of fire suppression reduce AWF and TAB due to fuel conditions reaching ignition thresholds less frequently. Less frequent fires, however, account for the greater TAB under fire suppression.
