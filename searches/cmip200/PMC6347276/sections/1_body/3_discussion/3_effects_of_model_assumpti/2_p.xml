<p class="p">Stochastic fire responds to the same drivers as the unlimited ignitions but in different ways. First, the use of an ignition probability function instead of a single fuel threshold allows fires to occur even under fuel conditions less severe than those at unlimited ignition threshold levels. Thus, during the early 20
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> c. some cells not experiencing fire under unlimited ignitions do experience fire under stochastic ignitions leading to a greater TAB under stochastic fire. Second, the probabilistic nature of ignition sources and fire initiation limits fire occurrence under fuel conditions exceeding thresholds, as during the early to late 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> c. when fire occurrence is more common across the entire study area under unlimited ignitions than under stochastic fire. During this period, TAB is lower under stochastic fire than under unlimited ignitions scenarios due to less frequent fire occurrence. The overall less frequent fires due to stochastic fire result in a lower AWF and higher FAB. Stochastic fire occurring below the thresholds set for unlimited ignitions accounts for the higher FAB at the end of the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> c., when stochastic fire initiates fires in subtropical mixed forest while unlimited ignitions does not.
