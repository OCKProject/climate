<p class="p">More live C is lost due to fire than is added due to CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fertilization. For unlimited ignitions, losses are greatest during the mid to late 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> c. when fuel thresholds are exceeded. For stochastic fire, the greatest losses are in the early 20
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> c. due to fires occurring where they cannot under unlimited ignitions. CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fertilization, however, may provide enough productivity to maintain a new equilibrium with increased dead C and limited decreases in ecosystem C. For all with-CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fertilization, with-fire scenarios, at the end of the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> c., the steady values of all C stocks and live to dead C ratios indicate the possibility of a new equilibrium. This is consistent with the near 0 g C m
