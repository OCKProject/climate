<p class="p">For scenarios with unlimited ignitions, consumed C directly reflects TAB increasing sharply in the mid 20
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> c. and then decreasing. This pattern is further reflected in NBP which decreases and increases with TAB. By the end of the 21

 <sup class="sup">-2</sup> yr
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> for scenarios with unlimited ignitions and with CO

For SF-WCE, consumed C and NBP also reflect TAB, with consumed C greater than that for unlimited-ignitions scenarios in the early 20
