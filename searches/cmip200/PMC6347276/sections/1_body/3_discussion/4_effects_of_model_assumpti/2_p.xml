<p class="p">CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fertilization is the strongest driver of NPP as shown by the similar increases in NPP across all scenarios with CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fertilization versus the similar decrease for scenarios without CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fertilization. Consumed C is very similar for all scenarios with unlimited ignitions. Increased carbon storage in young forests recovering from fire as well as to the reduction of dead material available for decomposition due to burning drive higher NEP for all scenarios with CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fertilization and unlimited ignitions. However, for FF-NCE, NEP decreases due to decreasing NPP.
