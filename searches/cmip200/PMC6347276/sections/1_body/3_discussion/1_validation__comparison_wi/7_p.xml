<p class="p">Soil data are critical for projecting accurate soil water availability and drought stress [
 <xref rid="pone.0210989.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. More accurate soil data would improve the reliability of growth, mortality, and fire simulation results. More recent MC2 simulations have used SSURGO data but at the time of this project, the dataset was still incomplete for large portions of our study area.
