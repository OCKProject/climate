<p class="p">The overall higher simulated TAB and the higher simulated TAB east of Puget Sound–primarily due to simulated fires in 1987 and 2003 –underscore the importance of modeling wildfire ignition limitations in addition to fuel limitations. Stochastic fire (SF) mitigates the overall higher TAB, but simulates more fires than observed in areas that are commonly fuel limited (Cascades and Coast range). The stochastic ignitions algorithm used in the SF-WCE scenario was implemented as a proof of concept with a random algorithm to locate ignition sources. An algorithm using a probability surface based on factors affecting ignition sources such as human presence and infrastructure (e.g. [

 <xref rid="pone.0210989.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]) and lightning strikes (e.g. [
 <xref rid="pone.0210989.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0210989.ref044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]) would likely produce more realistic results but this kind of data is lacking both for the beginning of 20
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> century and for the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century. Secondly, informing the algorithm with known relationships between fuel conditions and fire initiation would likely also improve results. Additionally, considering conditions more or less conducive to fire initiation, such as slope and other topographic characteristics could also contribute to higher quality fire modeling. Multiple model runs with stochastic ignition sources and success should also be considered to generate a statistics-based projection of fire on the landscape.
