 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210989.g004" class="xref">4B</xref>) may be due to the use of a dataset with deeper soils than are actually present. In the model, shallower soils retain less water, potentially leading to drier fuel conditions and greater fire. In this part of the study area, the STATSGO dataset used in the simulation has soil depths two to four times as deep as the more recent SSURGO dataset [
