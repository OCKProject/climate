<p class="p">Differences between our results and those of other studies (
 <xref rid="pone.0210989.t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>) are due to a number of factors. First, observation-based models generally only consider aboveground stocks, while MC2 models above- and belowground carbon, including soils and litter. Second, other studies include disturbances that MC2 does not, for example logging, insect infestations, and disease, which would account for some of the higher carbon stock value in our results. Third, the mapping of human-affected (HA) areas reduces differences due to land use, but HA areas can only be considered a first approximation of human influences on the landscape, including historical logging in areas now recovering and fires not accounted for in the simulation, (e.g. the Tillamook fire; [
