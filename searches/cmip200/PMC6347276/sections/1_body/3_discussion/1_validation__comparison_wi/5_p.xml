<p class="p">MC2 simulates potential vegetation most adapted to climate inputs. However, vegetation can endure under suboptimal conditions, slowing the replacement of one vegetation type by another, remaining until a sudden disturbance or mortality due to crossing a physiological threshold allows for rapid change. Moreover, MC2 does not simulate seed production, seedling establishment, or natural succession. These factors should be accounted for when using model projections for management decisions.</p>
