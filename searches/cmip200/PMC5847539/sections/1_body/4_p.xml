<p id="Par6" class="p">“Ensemble spread (99th percentile – 1st percentile) of increases in the number of heatwave days projected by the CMIP5 ensemble (blue) and CESM ensemble (purple) per 0.5 °C global warming, for (a) Alaska; (b) the Mediterranean; (c) Australia; (d) East Asia; (e) the Amazon, and (f) East Africa. These regions were chosen as they are representative of all 21 regions analysed. Note that the spread due to internal variability (estimated from CESM) is reasonably consistent across the thresholds. See table S.2 for region boundaries”.</p>
