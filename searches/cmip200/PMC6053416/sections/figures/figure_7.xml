  <p class="p">Global correlation maps of observation (top row), model outputs during the contemporary period (middle row), and model outputs at pre-industrial period (bottom row) for each model resolution. Missing data on land is shown in gray color. The color table represents the magnitude of correlations between forest total carbon mass and precipitation (horizontal) and between forest total carbon mass and surface temperature (vertical). Grid resolutions include (left to right): BNU-ESM, HadGEM2-ES, IPSL-CM5A-MR, and MIROC-ESM. [Maps were made using Matlab version 2016a,
