  <p class="p">Forest fractions in the northern extratropical regions during the contemporary period for upscaled observations (top row), CMIP5 models (center row), and the differences (bottom row, modelâ€“observation). Different resolutions according to model setup are shown (left to right): BNU-ESM, HadGEM2-ES, IPSL-CM5A-MR, and MIROC-ESM. Each model output and its corresponding upscaled observation data are masked by a common-grid land mask. Missing data is presented in light gray color. [Maps were made using the NCAR Command Language v6.4.0 software, 10.5065/D6WD3XH5].</p>
