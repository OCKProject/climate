<p id="Par12" class="p">The spatial correlations of forest total biomass and climatic conditions are generally consistent in ESMs and obsESMs in terms of the high positive correlations between biomass and precipitation (PR) at midlatitudes (30°N–60°N), while surface temperature (TAS) becomes as important as PR at high latitudes (60°N–75°N) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>). Due to the data aggregation process at different grid resolutions, some minor discrepancies exist between obsESMs, even the ones from the same modeling center (see Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S7</xref>). The three major inconsistent signals between ESMs and obsESMs are located in Alaska, northern China, and Scandinavia. In Alaska, the observations show positive correlations of forest total biomass with only TAS while both HadGEM2 ESMs show positive correlations of forest total biomass with both PR and TAS; IPSL-CM5A-MR and the MIROC ESMs capture the responses of forest total biomass to PR and TAS relatively better than the other ESMs. In northern China, models with higher resolutions (HadGEM2 ESMs and IPSL-CM5A-MR) exhibit weak positive correlations between forest total biomass and TAS, whereas the variations of forest total biomass are weakly negatively correlated with PR. These signals are not seen in either observations or ESMs at lower resolutions. In Scandinavia, the observed forest carbon mass at different model resolutions shows negative forest biomass responses to both PR and TAS changes. All IPSL and MIROC ESMs demonstrate similar results except that MIROC-ESM-CHEM shows a positive correlation between observed forest total biomass and PR in western Russia, while a negative correlation is found in the model (see Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S7</xref>). In contrast, forest total biomass is positively correlated to changes of PR and TAS in BNU-ESM and the HadGEM2 ESMs. Overall, the correlations of spatial variations in forest total biomass to that in PR and in TAS for IPSL-CM5A-MR are closer to the observations.

 </sup> highlights the spatial distributions of forest biomes in ESMs as compared with obsESMs. For this analysis, we combined all model forest PFTs into four biome categories—broadleaf evergreen tree, needleleaf evergreen tree, broadleaf deciduous tree, and needleleaf deciduous tree—except for the HadGEM2 ESMs, which were grouped into broadleaf tree and needleleaf tree only because of its simplified PFT representation (see Supplementary Tables 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S5</xref>). We found that ESMs roughly capture the spread of forest biomes in the Northern Hemisphere extratropics, except that ESMs have very few grid cells representing forests below −10 °C (see Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S8</xref>). The masked observational biomass in the modeled PR–TAS space, compared to that in the observed PR–TAS space, also shows fewer grid cells representing forests below −15 °C implying biases in modeled climatic conditions. Among the ESMs, only BNU-ESM shows broadleaf deciduous forests spanning a wide range in TAS, from −10 °C to 20 °C, while the observations indicate a narrower range for these forests.
