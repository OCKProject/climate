<p id="Par5" class="p">Four ESMs outputs, one per modeling center, from the eight selected ESM realizations (see Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>) demonstrate substantial differences of spatial forest fractions and forest total biomass compared to observations (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). BNU-ESM overestimates forest fractions and total biomass at midlatitudes over Europe, the United States, and China while it underestimates forest fractions in Siberia. These discrepancies of forest fractions (
 <italic class="italic">min</italic> = −0.92; 
 <italic class="italic">max</italic> = 0.95) and total carbon mass (
 <italic class="italic">min</italic> = −0.39 Pg C; 
 <italic class="italic">max</italic> = 1.63 Pg C) at grid cell level are mainly due to broadleaf deciduous temperate trees in the regions of overestimated forest fractions and C
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> arctic grass in the regions of underestimated forest fractions (see Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>). HadGEM2-ES, one of the two configurations from the Met Office Hadley Centre, noticeably underestimates forest fractions and biomass over Russia and Northern Canada with a magnitude up to 0.98 (
 <italic class="italic">min</italic> = −0.98; 
 <italic class="italic">max</italic> = 0.96) and 0.14 Pg C (
 <italic class="italic">min</italic> = −0.14 Pg C; 
 <italic class="italic">max</italic> = 0.14 Pg C), respectively. The uncertainty originates from the model identifying these regions as shrub-dominant (see Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>) whereas large portions of needleleaf forest are present in the observations. IPSL-CM5A-MR, one of the three ESM configurations from the Institut Pierre Simon Laplace (IPSL), shows biases in forest total biomass ranging from −0.19 Pg C to 0.41 Pg C with relatively lower biases in forest fractions (
 <italic class="italic">min</italic> = −0.58; 
 <italic class="italic">max</italic> = 0.78) compared to the other three centers’ ESMs; nevertheless, they generally exhibit positive biases in forest fractions across northern high latitudes, especially between 45°N–60°N. This is a consequence of excessively large fractions of boreal needleleaf evergreen trees and boreal needleleaf summergreen trees apportioned in the three IPSL ESMs (see Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>). MIROC-ESM, one of the two model configurations from the Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate (MIROC), demonstrates that the simulated forest fractions deviate from the observations by −0.68 to 0.97 with overpredicted forest fractions in Northern Canada and Eurasia north of 60°N (boreal forests) but with underestimated forest fractions over the northeast coast of North America (dominated by C
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> grasses) and over Eurasia south of 60°N (dominated by crops) (see Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>). The differences of global forest total biomass range from −0.37 Pg C to 0.62 Pg C. Spatial differences of forest fractions and total biomass of all eight ESMs are illustrated in Supplementary Figs 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>.
