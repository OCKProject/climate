<p id="Par6" class="p">Differences between the observed and modeled forest area also increase the uncertainty of forest biomass estimates when converting the carbon density retrieved from the CMIP5 archive and from the observations to carbon mass. We apply a common-grid land mask (see Methods) to each grid cell for each ESM output and its corresponding upscaled observations (obsESMs) based on the Global Land Cover 2000 (GLC2000) data

 </sup>. Different ESMs have different masks depending on the forest fraction and biomass availability in grid cells for an ESM and its obsESM. Masked forest area (“effective forest area” hereafter) and thus forest total biomass can exhibit substantial variations within ESMs and within obsESMs. For example, smaller effective forest area is found in the upscaled observation for the BNU-ESM (obsBNU-ESM) compared to that for the other obsESMs. This is because the mask applied to obsBNU-ESM excludes grid cells where BNU-ESM considers little or no forest existence in the model. With the common-grid land mask applied, the effective forest area for ESMs is (1.2–2.0) × 10
 <sup class="sup">9</sup> ha, whereas that for obsESMs is (0.8–1.6) × 10
 <sup class="sup">9</sup> ha (see Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref>). Modeled effective forest area is underestimated in both HadGEM2 ESMs (−24% for HadGEM2-CC and −19% for HadGEM2-ES) while overestimated effective forest area is found in BNU-ESM (47%) as well as in the IPSL ESMs and the MIROC ESMs (29–36%). This uncertainty is mainly attributable to the lack of the ESMs representing the observed land cover types shown in GLC2000. For instance, BNU-ESM allocates C
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> arctic grass rather than any forest type in most regions north of 50°N. Another example can be found from the HadGEM2 ESMs in which the majority of land over Asian Russia and northwest North America is covered by shrubs, resulting in low proportions of forest types being allocated in the models. Due to large uncertainties between ESMs and obsESMs caused by different land cover definitions, we apply various thresholds of the forest fraction (

 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">f</italic>
 </sub>) to examine how uncertainty varies with 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">f</italic>
 </sub>. It is expected that higher 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">f</italic>
 </sub> levels produce grid cells more dominated by homogeneous forest types and thus minimize the inconsistencies of PFT definitions between ESMs and obsESMs. However, higher 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">f</italic>
 </sub> thresholds result in less data availability. For example, by increasing 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">f</italic>
 </sub> from 0 to 0.1, the effective forest area significantly reduces to two-thirds of its value at

  <italic class="italic">f</italic>
 </sub> = 0 for BNU-ESM and to 83–88% for the other ESMs (see Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref>). Therefore, this study applies

 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">f</italic>
