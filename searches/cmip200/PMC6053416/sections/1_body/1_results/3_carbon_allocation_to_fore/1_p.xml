<p id="Par11" class="p">Global carbon mass allocated in forest biomass compartments for all but the IPSL ESMs is consistently over-apportioned to wood but under-apportioned to leaves and roots (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). The carbon allocation to forest compartments for all obsESMs ranges from 93.7–97.4% in Wood + Root, 2.6–6.3% in leaves, 67.9–83.3% in wood, and 13.9–25.9% in roots, while the mean values of all obsESMs with one standard deviation are 96.5% ± 1.5%, 3.5% ± 1.5%, 87.1% ± 7.9%, and 9.4% ± 8.5%, respectively. All IPSL ESMs apportion carbon mass to wood and to roots, with an institutional average of 76.96% ± 0.59% for the former and 20.73% ± 0.19% for the latter, the closest to the observed values. The institutional averages from the two MIROC ESMs and from the two HadGEM2 ESMs are found to allocate the carbon mass in Wood + Root (95.25% ± 0.04% for HadGEM2 ESMs and 95.22% ± 0.09% for MIROC ESMs) and in leaves (4.75% ± 0.04% for HadGEM2 ESMs and 4.78% ± 0.09% for MIROC ESMs) the closest to the observations. These results suggest that the HadGEM2 ESMs and the MIROC ESMs combine the biomass of coarse roots into the woody biomass pool, so that too much carbon is apportioned to wood and too little is apportioned to roots; on the contrary, the IPSL ESMs likely define the carbon mass in roots as the sum of coarse and fine root carbon mass since the carbon allocations are closer to the observed values.
