 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4a</xref>). In terms of individual forest compartments, the combined Wood + Root biomass has biases ranging from −19.0 Pg C in HadGEM2-CC to 130.4 Pg C in IPSL-CM5A-MR (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4b</xref>); the biases of biomass in leaves ranges from −1.3 Pg C in HadGEM2-CC to 0.4 Pg C in IPSL-CM5A-MR (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4c</xref>); the biases of biomass in wood ranges from −5.7 Pg C in HadGEM2-CC to 120.0 Pg C in BNU-ESM (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4d</xref>); the biases of biomass in roots ranges from −13.3 Pg C in HadGEM2-CC to 25.8 Pg C in IPSL-CM5A-MR (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4e</xref>). A further examination on utilizing detailed biomass data at grid cell level rather than the grid area-weighted level from the HadGEM2-ES model results illustrates relatively smaller biases, though the bias of forest total biomass changes from negative (−13.4 Pg C) by utilizing grid area-averaged biomass data to positive (10.5 Pg C) by utilizing detailed biomass data at the grid cell level (see Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>). Compared to the mean value of forest total biomass from all obsESMs, that from all ESMs is overpredicted by 47.8 Pg C; for individual forest compartments, the mean value from all ESMs shows overpredicted forest biomass in Wood + Root by 43.4 Pg C, in wood by 41.5 Pg C, and in roots by 1.9 Pg C, while the biomass in leaves is underpredicted by 0.2 Pg C. Note that all ESMs predict the biomass in leaves within the uncertainty range of obsESMs, while BNU-ESM and the IPSL ESMs predict too much forest total biomass and biomass in Wood + Root due to overestimated biomass in wood (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4d</xref>). The institutional mean values of forest biomass for each modeling center show enlarged magnitude of bias in total mass (7.7 Pg C) and biomass in Wood + Root (10.2 Pg C) compared to multi-model mean values. The increased bias of biomass in wood (14.8 Pg C) is the major cause of the increasing discrepancies, even though the institutional mean biomass in roots is reduced (−4.57 Pg C). Details of extratropical forest carbon mass across 30° N–80° N for each ESM and for each modeling center is shown in Supplementary Table
