<p id="Par21" class="p">Outputs of eight Earth system model (ESM) simulations from the CMIP5 archive with the historical experiment “r1i1p1” (see Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>) are selected based on the data availability of carbon density of individual plant functional types (PFTs) for all biomass compartments including leaf, wood, root, and the total biomass. The model outputs contain climatic variables as well as detailed information about forest biomass for various PFTs (see Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref>). Two climatic variables, the precipitation rate (PR) and the surface temperature (TAS), are analyzed to investigate the spatial correlations of forest biomass and climate. The forest biomass in CMIP5 archive stores a single carbon density derived from the area-weighted carbon density of all vegetation types in each grid cell. Hence, forests and grasses have the same carbon density value as long as their area fractions are non-zero within a grid cell. In this study, forest carbon density (kg C m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>) is converted into carbon mass (petagrams of carbon, Pg C). Data during 1982–2005 is averaged to represent the climatological mean status during the contemporary period, while that during the pre-industrial period is based on the climatological mean status during 1861–1885.
