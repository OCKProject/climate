First, forest biomass in stems was derived from a radar remote sensing growing stock volume (GSV) product

 </sup>, which integrates observations between October 2009 and February 2011, and information on wood density. Subsequently, the other biomass compartments (branches, roots, foliage) have been estimated based on a database of allometric relationships to stems. Furthermore, precipitation flux and surface temperature from the Global Soil Wetness Project Phase 3 (GSWP3) forcing data products (0.5° × 0.5°)

 </sup> serve as the observational climatic data. For land cover types, we adopt the land cover definitions from 1 km × 1 km global land cover classification for the year 2000 (GLC2000) database

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref>). We reproject GLC2000 (applying nearest-neighbor interpolation) in order to match the resolution of the observation-based biomass product. To compare to each ESM’s output, this product is further upscaled to eight data sets with coarser grid resolutions that are the same as the eight selected CMIP5 model simulations (see Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>) while retaining the PFT-level biomass distributions (i.e., different carbon densities instead of a single area-weighted carbon density for each PFT within a grid cell).
