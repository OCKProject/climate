<p id="Par24" class="p">The forest fractions for observation-based data are determined by GLC2000. The GLC2000 data is upscaled to coarser resolutions, varying from 1.25° × 1.875° to 2.8125° × 2.8125° (see Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>), according to each model’s setup. We classify four major forest types including broadleaf evergreen trees, needleleaf evergreen trees, broadleaf deciduous trees, and needleleaf deciduous trees (see Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S5</xref>) when evaluating modeled forest distributions in Whittaker climate space. Alternatively, we combine the first ten classes in GLC2000 as the “lumped” forest type
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">24</xref>
 </sup> to quantify the uncertainty caused by spin-up processes in ESMs (see Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S6</xref>). For each ESM output, modeled forest fractions are compared to that from those upscaled GLC2000 data at the same grid resolution. Uncertainty due to different forest definitions between GLC2000 and ESMs can be minimized by applying a common-grid land mask with various forest fraction thresholds (

 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">f</italic>
 </sub>). The common-grid land mask keeps only the grid cells where both model outputs and observations have non-zero forest fractions as well as valid biomass values of forest types. 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">f</italic>
 </sub> ranges from 0 to 0.9 with an increment of 0.1. Grid cells with forest fractions lower than or equal to 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">f</italic>
 </sub> are masked out in both model outputs and observations. A higher 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">f</italic>
 </sub> means that the carbon pool in grid cells composed of a larger proportion of forest-only biomass, i.e., the uncertainty caused by assigning a fixed carbon density for all PFTs in the ESMs is reduced.
