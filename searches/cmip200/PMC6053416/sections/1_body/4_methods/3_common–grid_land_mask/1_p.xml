<p id="Par23" class="p">We verify the data availability at each grid cell for the upscaled observational data sets and the ESM output. A grid cell is masked out when either observational or modeled forest biomass is unavailable at that grid cell. Due to different PFT distributions and grid resolutions, the available grid cells vary in each ESM. The total carbon stock estimated from the upscaled observational data sets, even though they are upscaled from the same product, are hence different. Therefore, we use relative errors, in addition to the total carbon stock, to evaluate the performance of each ESM output.</p>
