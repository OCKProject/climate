<p id="Par2" class="p">The amount of carbon stored in vegetation biomass in terrestrial ecosystems plays an important role in influencing Earth’s climate. Variations in productivity, respiration, carbon turnover and in carbon allocation to biomass compartments in response to anthropogenic and natural climate change influence the magnitude, spatial distribution and allocation of vegetation carbon stocks. At present, the land biosphere is a carbon sink since atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) is increasingly sequestered in terrestrial ecosystems
