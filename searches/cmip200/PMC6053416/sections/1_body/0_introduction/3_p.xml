 </sup>. Spatial correlations of forest biomass and climatic conditions over this region are also assessed. Some of the ESMs analyzed here allowed for prognostic vegetation distributions using a Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (DGVM) and some did not. In addition, we compare the differences between area-weighted forest biomass at grid cell level and detailed information on forest biomass of individual plant functional types (PFTs) for each model realization. The former provides only the mean carbon density of all PFTs within a grid cell but no carbon density for individual PFTs, while the latter retains different carbon densities for each PFT within a grid cell. Moreover, we analyze the differences of biases in ESMs during the contemporary period and the PI period to investigate the uncertainty caused by parametric or structural model configurations. Hence, taking into account the uncertainty in observations, this study indicates sources of uncertainty for the magnitude and carbon allocation of extratropical forest biomass estimates that may facilitate improved representation of land processes in ESMs that will impact carbon–climate simulations such as those for the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6).
