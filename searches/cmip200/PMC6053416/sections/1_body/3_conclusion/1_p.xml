<p id="Par20" class="p">We evaluated forest biomass from eight CMIP5 ESMs using a biomass dataset for the northern extratropical latitudes that was synthesized from radar remote sensing of stem volume and ground-based observations of wood density and allometric relationships between biomass compartments. ESMs exhibited large biases in forest distribution, forest fraction, and carbon mass that contributed to the overall uncertainty in forest total biomass. We showed that forest total biomass is positively correlated with precipitation variations with temperature becoming equally important at higher latitudes. Finally, we showed that uncertainties in the pre-industrial forest biomass (spin-up) persisted into the contemporary period in most ESMs. To improve future analysis of vegetation biomass, we recommend saving and archiving PFT-level carbon stocks and fluxes, which can be used for analysis and benchmarking. Routine evaluation of model biomass in all compartments and of the spatial distribution of vegetation types is important for identifying sources of uncertainty in carbon cycle predictions.</p>
