<p id="Par15" class="p">For the uncertainty of forest total carbon mass, our analyses show that four of the ESM simulations, if observational uncertainty is considered, overestimate the total carbon mass mainly due to overestimated biomass in wood. Since all ESMs consider carbon cycle feedbacks and land use change, the overestimates are possibly associated with biases in PFT structures and parameters in the DGVM and the land cover change setup in the ESMs. Traditionally, climate models use a prescribed coverage of land surface types, based on present-day observed land cover, but increasingly, ESMs are simulating the vegetation coverage internally using process-based DGVMs embedded within their land-surface scheme. This means that the models may incur biases and errors in the coverage of vegetated lands (e.g. trees, grasses, etc.), but such DGVMs offer the advantage that changes in vegetation cover in response to climate and CO

 </sup>. In our results, BNU-ESM used a DGVM to provide prognostic, climate-driven land cover change, but did not consider anthropogenic land use change; the three IPSL ESMs simulated the forest biomass with prescribed land use change but without prognostic land cover change; the two MIROC ESMs and the two HadGEM2 ESMs employed DGVMs for prognostic land cover change and incorporated prescribed land use change impacts (see Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>). Our analyses show that BNU-ESM and the IPSL ESMs exhibit large uncertainty in forest biomass estimates (institutional mean

  <italic class="italic">total</italic>
 </sub> = −0.11 and 0.13, respectively). Furthermore, Northern Hemisphere extratropical forest distributions in Whittaker climate space are mostly consistent with aggregated observations, except that BNU-ESM shows broadleaf deciduous trees below −10 °C, where needleleaf deciduous trees are found in the observations (see Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S8</xref>). According to the Whittaker diagrams, vegetation models from all modeling centers, except BNU-ESM, capture biome distributions reasonably well; however, too little forest biomass was simulated by ESMs in low temperature zones, i.e., needleleaf or needleleaf deciduous trees were underrepresented in the ESMs. For BNU-ESM, forest biomass was underestimated over northern Asia because too much carbon was allocated to C
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> arctic grass instead of to needleleaf forests. Biases in modeled climatic conditions also induce uncertainty in forest biomass estimates. The Whittaker diagrams of observed biomass in modeled climate space show a bias towards warmer temperatures over land in regions where needleleaf deciduous trees are located in the observations. These results suggest that (1) better PFT representations in the DGVM, (2) land use change, and (3) reducing biases in climatic conditions that affect plant productivity should all be considered in simulations to reduce the uncertainty of future forest carbon pool estimates. Further simulations for each model can help improve the understanding of the impact on biomass uncertainty due individually to the DGVM, land use changes, and climatic conditions.
