<p id="Par14" class="p">The present study evaluates the uncertainty of forest biomass across northern extratropical latitudes from eight coupled ESM simulations. Instead of regridding all ESM outputs and a recent observation-based data to a common grid resolution that induces additional uncertainty, we aggregate the fine-resolution observational data to the same grid resolution of each ESM so that each ESM output can be compared fairly to the aggregated observations. We examine the sources of uncertainty of forest biomass estimates through the forest fractions, the magnitude of carbon mass differences, the carbon mass allocations in forest compartments, and the biases carried from the spin-up results. Inconsistent definitions of PFTs between ESMs and observations contribute to the uncertainty of forest spatial distributions and thus large variations of forest fractions and biomass in each grid cell are found in ESMs

 </sup>. After masks are applied, such inconsistencies cause significant differences in effective forest area among ESMs and among obsESMs. We also find that the unmasked total carbon mass in each aggregated observation data set for different ESM grid resolutions is the same but becomes smaller after forest-only masks are applied to grid cells (see Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S9</xref>). The magnitude of discrepancy in modeled forest fraction and total biomass can be up to 0.98 and up to 1.63 Pg C, respectively, compared to the aggregated observations at the grid cell level. The bias of masked forest total biomass estimates in the northern extratropical region ranges from −20.3 Pg C to 134.7 Pg C and is mainly attributed to the bias in the wood compartment (−5.7 Pg C to 120.0 Pg C). In addition, CMIP5 models typically do not output the varying carbon density for all available PFTs within a grid cell. Some of the forest biomass uncertainty results from aggregation of PFT-level carbon pools to the grid cell level for purposes of reporting. This causes the loss of carbon density heterogeneity at the grid cell level and tends to lead to larger biases in carbon mass estimates. Analysis of HadGEM2-ES outputs with detailed PFT-level carbon pools demonstrates a reduction in modeled forest total carbon mass bias of 2.9 Pg C compared to the grid cell-level data reported in the CMIP5 archive. Hence, we suggest adding detailed PFT-level output of carbon stock and flux variables in CMIP6 simulations so that the uncertainty in future carbon mass estimates reported to the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change can be attributed to ecosystem processes for each PFT. While causes of individual variations among model estimates of biomass are difficult to ascertain, multiple sources of uncertainty, as described below, contribute, including prognostic vegetation dynamics, land use and land cover change, and carbon allocation.
