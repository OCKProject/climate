<p id="Par16" class="p">In addition to the DGVM and land cover changes, the allometric equations of forest carbon mass also contribute to the simulated forest biomass uncertainty in ESMs. For example, the simulations from the HadGEM2 ESMs indiscriminately allocate exactly the same carbon mass in roots and in leaves (see Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>), which induces uncertainty in forest biomass estimates in these two simulations. Better representations of the dynamic carbon allocation schemes apportioning the carbon mass in leaves and roots should reduce the uncertainty of forest biomass estimates in ESMs

 </sup>. Furthermore, all simulations except those from the IPSL ESMs consistently allocate too much carbon mass to wood but too little to leaves and roots. Although the proportions of carbon mass in wood and in roots simulated by the IPSL ESMs are within the observational uncertainty (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6c,d</xref>), the HadGEM2 ESMs and the MIROC ESMs have better carbon allocations for combined wood and root biomass (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6a</xref>). This result, which has also been shown in Negrón-Juárez

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>
 </sup>, suggests the HadGEM2 ESMs and the MIROC ESMs include the coarse roots in the wood pool, while the IPSL ESMs report the coarse roots biomass as a part of root biomass. Therefore, it is more appropriate to compare the combined biomass in wood and in roots when estimating the uncertainty between ESMs, for individual models and the aggregated observations. Overestimation of wood and total biomass may also be attributable to positive biases in net primary productivity, poor parameterization of fire frequency and intensity
