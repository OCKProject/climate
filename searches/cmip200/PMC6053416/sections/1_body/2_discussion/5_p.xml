<p id="Par18" class="p">However, in addition to the uncertainties in the models, the observation-based product exhibits uncertainties as well. Sources of these uncertainties in the observation-based biomass estimate include the sensitivity of the radar signal to properties other than vegetation structure, the influence of non-forest vegetation on the signal, uncertainties in additional datasets (e.g. allometric databases, land cover, etc.) used for conversion of satellite measurements to biomass estimates, and the necromass component of vegetation in the observed growing stock volume. The application of allometric relationships derived on a leaf type level from a biomass compartment database has introduced relatively high uncertainties in observation-based estimates of leaf and root biomass compared to a moderate uncertainty in wood biomass. The uncertainty of the observation-based total biomass, however, is considered to be a conservative estimate and independent evaluations using upscaled forest inventory data have demonstrated the validity of the applied product at regional scales
