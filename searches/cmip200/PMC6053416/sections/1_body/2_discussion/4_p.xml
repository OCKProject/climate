<p id="Par17" class="p">Examination of the spin-up effect suggests that the uncertainty introduced at the beginning of the simulation in ESMs plays an important role in influencing the forest biomass estimates. Such spin-up issues have also been reported in soil carbon storage in CMIP5 outputs

As discussed above, the DGVM, land cover changes, and better representations and parameterizations of productivity, respiration and carbon turnover processes in the land models should be considered to improve model performance. Recent studies have shown that, in addition to mismatches in modeled compared to observed net primary production, carbon turnover processes are a major source of uncertainty in global vegetation models
