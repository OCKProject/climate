<p id="Par19" class="p">Since the uncertainty of extratropical forest biomass estimates in ESMs can be from more factors in addition to the causes mentioned in this study, we suggest that the community utilize software packages to evaluate the performance of coupled ESMs whenever there is an improvement or modification in models. These tools can benefit the community by informing future development of ESMs. For instance, the International Land Model Benchmarking (ILAMB) project
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">44</xref>
 </sup> provides a means to not only provide the statistics of model outputs but also quickly and easily evaluate how model performance changes with each modification in ESMs through skill score spreads. Because of uncertainties in observational data, ILAMB incorporated multiple observational data sets for the same variable to provide the user with some indication of that observational uncertainty. With an increasing or a decreasing score, researchers are able to determine whether a modification in ESMs will reduce the model uncertainty in forest biomass estimates.
