 <p class="p">This work was supported through the Reducing Uncertainties in Biogeochemical Interactions through Synthesis and Computation Scientific Focus Area (RUBISCO SFA), which is sponsored by the Regional and Global Climate Modeling (RGCM) Program in the Climate and Environmental Sciences Division (CESD) of the Office of Biological and Environmental Research (BER) in the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science. This research used resources of the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), which is managed by UT-Battelle, LLC for the U.S. Department of Energy under Contract No. DE-AC05–00OR22725 and was performed at ORNL. C.D.J was supported by the Joint UK BEIS/Defra Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme (GA01101) and M.T. was supported by the Vetenskapsrådet grant 621-2014-4266 of the Swedish Research Council. We acknowledge the World Climate Research Programme’s Working Group on Coupled Modelling, which is responsible for CMIP, and we thank the climate modeling groups (listed in Supplementary Table 
  <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>) for producing and making available their model output. For CMIP the U.S. Department of Energy’s Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison provides coordinating support and led development of software infrastructure in partnership with the Global Organization for Earth System Science Portals. We acknowledge the kind assistance of Prof. Shilong Piao from the Department of Ecology at Peking University for sharing the plotting scripts for global spatial correlation maps.
