<p id="Par18" class="p">To measure the robustness of the climate change signals, a variety of methods have been proposed based on either the significance of changes relative to internal variability or the model agreement on the sign of change

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">46</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">47</xref>

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">48</xref>
 </sup>. We consider a climate change signal to be robust where at least 70% of the models agree on the direction of change. Otherwise, the change is interpreted as ‘unreliable’ and masked in gray color on the maps.
