<p id="Par16" class="p">The WAS-CORDEX ensemble consists of 14 members: two RCMs, two greenhouse gas scenarios and six driving GCMs. The RCMs are (1) the Sveriges Meteorologiska och Hydrologiska institute (SMHI) Rossby Centre Regional Atmospheric Climate Model, version 4 (RCA4) and (2) the Max Planck Institute Regional Model (REMO). These WAS-CORDEX RCMs were used to downscale the results of six CMIP5 GCMs of CNRM-CM5, EC-EARTH, GFDL-ESM2M, IPSL-CM5A-MR, MIROC5 and MPI-ESM-LR. The attributes of RCMs and GCMs used in this study are presented in the Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>. All WAS-CORDEX RCM simulations performed at a model grid resolution of 0.44° × 0.44° are available for two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP4.5 &amp; RCP8.5). RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 represent mid and high levels of emission scenario respectively, corresponding to a radiative forcing of approximately 4.5 and 8.5 W/m
