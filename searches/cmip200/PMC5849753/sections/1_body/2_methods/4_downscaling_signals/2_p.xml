<p id="Par21" class="p">Because RCMs and GCMs use different horizontal resolutions, we regridded all the original extreme precipitation changes to the same resolution. The results of several interpolation methods such as linear, nearest neighbor, cubic, cubic spline were carefully compared to investigate the sensitivity of the results to the interpolation method used. The comparison shows that the choice of interpolation method does not influence the main conclusions of the EDS analysis.</p>
