<p id="Par5" class="p">Here we analyze how climate change signals and the associated uncertainties as well as the difference between the results of RCMs and driving global climate models (GCMs) for extreme and mean precipitation vary with seasons. An ensemble of WAS-CORDEX RCM projections (see Supplementary TableÂ 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>) is used to derive the change signals for the late 21st century. The domain of analysis is the Middle East region which has received less attention globally and regionally despite its high sensitivity to climate change due to an arid climate and limited resources to acclimate with the negative effects socially, economically and technologically.
