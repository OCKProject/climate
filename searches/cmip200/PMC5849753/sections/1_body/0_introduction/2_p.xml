<p id="Par3" class="p">Another important issue in this context is that climate change results are highly model dependent so that even opposite climate change signals may be achieved from different types of climate models

 </sup>. This is mainly due to the fact that climate models with different resolutions and physics provide different representations of surface heterogeneities and mesoscale climatological structures

 </sup>. To better understand the added value of fine-scale climate models versus coarse-scale ones, it is important to quantify the extent to which the discrepancy between driving and driven climate models varies with seasons.
