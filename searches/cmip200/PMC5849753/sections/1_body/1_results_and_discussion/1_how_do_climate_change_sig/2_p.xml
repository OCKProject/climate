<p id="Par7" class="p">The “increase in autumn, decrease in spring” pattern for less extreme precipitation is held for mean precipitation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). For RCP8.5, over 66% of the land area is affected by a robust increase in autumn mean precipitation, whereas around 58% of the land area shows a robust decrease in spring mean precipitation. The decrease in large-scale precipitation in the Middle East can be due to polewards movement of the Northern Hemisphere storm tracks under climate change conditions which weakens the Mediterranean storm track and reduces the number of cyclones crossing the Mediterranean

 </sup>. There is a less spatially homogeneous change over the Middle East region for winter and summer mean precipitation and both increasing and decreasing signals are observed. Overall, the results of this study are in contrast to the “wet season gets wetter, dry season gets drier” paradigm and instead suggest “wetter autumn, drier spring” pattern. It means that the rainy season in the Middle East is shifting as a consequence of climate change. In fact, the rains will come too late and out of the growing season of crops. The decrease in spring precipitation obtained here along with the highly evaporative conditions in this season

 </sup>. On the other hand, the rainfall at an unexpected time together with more intense rainfall in the harvesting season will harm crop yield and degrade food security in the region. The Red Sea region (e.g., Egypt and Sudan) are seen as hotspots where a robust and large spring precipitation decrease is pronounced, while the hotspots for summer precipitation are the northern regions of the Middle East (e.g., Turkey and North Iran). The shift in rainy season (and available water) from winter and spring to autumn may exacerbate existing water management issues (e.g., water stress and dry zone expansion) across the Middle East. In addition to seasonal variation of climate change signals, the robust changes also accelerate with the emission level (from RCP4.5 to RCP8.5): from 57% to 69% of the land area for winter, from 68% to 74% for spring, from 54% to 57% for summer and from 67% to 74% for autumn (Figure
