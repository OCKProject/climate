<p id="Par6" class="p">Figures 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> show changes in extreme precipitation in different seasons based on the median ensemble of the WAS-CORDEX RCMs for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 over the Middle East region. For the rare extreme events (extreme precipitation of 15-year return period), an increase is projected for all seasons, with a noticeably higher increase for autumn. The robust increase in the autumn rare events for RCP8.5 is observed in about 74% of the domain (Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>), while robust increasing signals cover a smaller part of the domain in spring (33% for RCP8.5). This “highest increase in autumn, lowest increase in spring” pattern gradually changes to “increase in autumn, decrease in spring” pattern for less extreme precipitation (i.e., very extreme and moderate extreme). The decreasing signal in spring very extreme and moderate extreme precipitation is not as strong as the increasing signal for autumn in terms of magnitude and spatial extent. Consistent over different seasons and precipitation intensities, the amplitude of the changes is stronger in the most pessimistic emission scenario RCP8.5 than in the intermediate scenario RCP4.5 (Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>).
