<p id="Par10" class="p">We decompose the total uncertainty in mean and extreme precipitation changes into GCM, RCM and RCP uncertainties (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). The choice of GCMs is the dominant source of uncertainty in mean and extreme precipitation changes for all seasons except for summer for which RCM uncertainty dominates the total uncertainty for very extreme and moderate extreme precipitation. The dominancy of RCM uncertainty for summer extreme precipitation is in good agreement with the results found in Europe and North America

 </sup>. This is attributed to the fact that local processes are mainly responsible for summer extreme precipitation changes rather than large-scale atmospheric circulations and each RCM has a different representation of such processes

 </sup>. The RCP uncertainty is generally less prominent compared with the other uncertainty sources, being larger in the cold season (autumn and winter) than in the warm season (spring and summer). The RCP uncertainty accounts for 16–29% of the total uncertainty, whereas model uncertainties go as high as 48%. This is also evident from the spatial maps of relative importance of these three uncertainty sources (Figures 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>-
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S6</xref>). The small scenario uncertainty in the CORDEX ensembles is due in part to the unavailability of the RCM simulations for the extreme low emission scenario (i.e., RCP2.6), which results in an underestimation of the scenario uncertainty
