<p id="Par9" class="p">Figures 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4e,f</xref> show that the magnitude of uncertainty in precipitation changes widely differs across seasons. For both mean and extreme precipitation, the smallest amount of total uncertainty is seen for spring and winter, respectively. The largest uncertainty in rare extreme event changes is observed for summer and spring, and the total uncertainty decreases towards less extreme precipitation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4e</xref>) and mean precipitation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4f</xref>).
