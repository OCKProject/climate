<p id="Par14" class="p">Comparative analysis between the results of the WAS-CORDEX RCMs and the driving CMIP5 GCMs show the largest discrepancy for summer when model spatial revolution plays a more important role for precipitation simulations. This is indeed due to the diminishing influence of large-scale phenomena and a greater dependence of extreme precipitation on local processes in summer. In addition, the heavier the precipitation is, the larger the RCM-GCM results discrepancy will be. This underscores the urgent need of enlarging multi-model ensembles of CORDEX RCM integrations for local climate change impact analyses especially for summer when some extreme precipitation intensities may be totally missing in GCM simulations, leading, in turn, to an underestimation of the future extreme precipitation and flood hazards derived from GCM results.</p>
