<p id="Par12" class="p">This study provides an evidence for violation of “wet gets wetter, dry gets drier” paradigm using an ensemble of WAS-CORDEX RCM projections. Our results show an increase in autumn mean precipitation and a decrease in spring mean precipitation in the Middle East for the end of this century, while there is not a spatially coherent pattern for summer and winter precipitation changes. It means neither the wet season gets wetter nor the dry season gets drier in the region. As for extreme precipitation, the Middle East region is identified as a climate change hotspot where extreme precipitation is expected to increase for all seasons, with a “highest increase in autumn, lowest increase in spring” pattern. Extreme precipitation change signals are amplified for more extreme precipitation and higher emission level (RCP8.5). These results are alarming in the sense that arid regions such as the Middle East are more vulnerable to the future increase in extreme precipitation as their infrastructure is less experienced or not well adapted for extreme events. A well-adapted system on which people’s livelihoods can be based is needed for more erratic precipitation in the future.</p>
