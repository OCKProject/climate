  <p class="p">Changes in extreme precipitation of 15-, 5- and 1-year return periods (T) in extreme seasons (i.e., winter and summer) based on the median ensemble of the WAS-CORDEX RCMs for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 over the Middle East region. The changes are computed for the period 2070–2099 with respect to the reference 1971–2000. Values are masked in gray where the change is not robust (change is robust if at least 70% of all model runs agree on the sign of the change). The maps were generated using the software ArcGIS (version 10)
