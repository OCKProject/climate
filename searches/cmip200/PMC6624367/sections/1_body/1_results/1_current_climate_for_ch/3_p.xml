<p id="Par8" class="p">Extreme measures of CH are presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>. For ERA-Interim reanalysis, some northwest and central regions have CH &gt;6 more than 200 days a year, and CH &gt;10 more than 100 days a year, with somewhat lower values in coastal regions and in southern and eastern Australia. These features are reproduced well by the GCM ensemble as well as the CCAM and WRF downscaling ensembles. There is some variation between modelling methods, including as noted previously from Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> with relatively low values in the northwest for GCM and WRF results as compared to CCAM. The degree of consistency between data sets, including in different regions throughout Australia based on the different measures presented in Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>, helps provide confidence in the ability of the models to simulate different aspects of the CH climatology.
