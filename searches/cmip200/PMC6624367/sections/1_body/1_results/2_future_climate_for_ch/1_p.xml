<p id="Par9" class="p">Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> shows projected future changes in the number of days per year with CH greater than its 95
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> percentile, with the 95
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> percentiles defined for the historical period 1990–2009. The 95
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> percentiles are calculated individually at each grid-cell location for each model, providing an indication of CH values that are large relative to local conditions, also noting that the 95
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> percentiles are very high in most regions (i.e., CH is about 6 or higher from Fig.

 </sup>). The use of this percentile-based threshold provides a common baseline value for the historical period, of around 18 days per year on average for all modelling methods, as a consistent reference point for examining future projected changes. The modelling methods are based on a high emissions scenario with increasing atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations over the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century (as detailed in the Methods section).
