  <p class="p">Relative influence of the different sources of variation on species’ level sensitivity metrics in function of species range size. The plot represents the relative influence of SDMs, GCMs, and RCPs on overall species sensitivity to climate change in response to species’ range size. A TSS threshold of 0.7 was used for all analyses. Species ranges were classified for equal size at the log scale</p>
