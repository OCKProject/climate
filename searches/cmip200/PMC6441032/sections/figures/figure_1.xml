  <p class="p">Relative influence of the different sources of variation on speciesâ€™ level sensitivity metrics. The plot represents the relative influence of the choice of species distribution models (SDMs), global circulation models (GCMs) and representative concentration pathways (RCPs) on the variance of change in climatic suitability (left) and loss of suitable climate (right) for all modelled species. The deviance was calculated across all species by means of a nested ANOVA and the partitioning is represented by the percentage of explained deviance (note that the unexplained deviance is not represented here). ANOVAs were run for three different TSS thresholds (0.4, 0.6, and 0.7) above which individual SDMs were retained for assessing the model results</p>
