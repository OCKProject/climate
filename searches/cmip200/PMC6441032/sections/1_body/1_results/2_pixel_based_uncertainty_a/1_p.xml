<p id="Par6" class="p">The overall variation originating from the combination of SDMs, GCMs and RCPs markedly differed between pixel-based metrics and among species groups (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). Under the ‘no dispersal’ assumption the amphibians showed lower variation than the other groups, while the variation in the other metrics was generally higher for amphibians. This is probably reflecting that amphibian species are slightly less easy to model (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>) at that particular resolution (100 km) and scale (global) and generally occur in location where RCPs and GCMs also diverge most (Supplementary Figs. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">5</xref>–
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">8</xref>). Interestingly, the change in α-diversity was particularly sensitive to the choice of SDMs, which explained by far most of the deviance for that metric (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). This was much less the case for the estimates of relative species turnover and loss per pixel were a larger proportion of the deviance was additionally explained by the RCPs, with the strongest effects for the time horizon 2070. While SDMs explained a constant portion of the deviance, the percentage of explained deviance by RCP scenarios increased considerably for 2070 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). This result confirms that when using sensitivity metrics that account for dispersal limitation (e.g. change in α-diversity), the uncertainty due to the choice of SDMs becomes particularly important and may hide variations due to RCPs.
