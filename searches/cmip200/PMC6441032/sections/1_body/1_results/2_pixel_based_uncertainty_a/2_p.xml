<p id="Par7" class="p">Interestingly, the relative influence of SDMs, GCMs, and RCPs markedly varied in space at the scale of the IPBES sub-region (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">9</xref>) but also at the pixel-scale (Supplementary Figs. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">10</xref>–
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">15</xref>). This was particularly true for the effect of selecting GCMs, which on average have a low effect, but appear relatively strong in explaining the deviance in both %loss (percent of currently suitable area lost) and Δβs (percent change in total diversity per IPBES sub-region divided by the mean α-diversity per sub-region), under ‘no dispersal’ in all of the Europe and Central Asia region, and in the North Africa and the Australia sub-regions for birds, and to a lesser extent for mammals and amphibians (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). Similarly, the deviance explained by RCPs for βt (temporal turnover) was much higher than the one explained by SDMs in Africa and South America, while this was opposite in Europe, Central Asia and North America (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). These varying effects can be explained by the spatial structure of the predicted changes in the different sensitivity metrics (Supplementary Figs. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">10</xref>–
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">15</xref>). For instance, the areas with the highest projected changes in the percentage of species loss by 2070 were mostly located in Africa and South America, areas where most of the variation was explained by RCPs (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">12</xref>). A similar result was obtained for changes in α-diversity (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">11</xref>), where the areas with the highest expected changes (Northern Americas, Northern Africa, some areas in Central Asia) coincide with areas for which the largest deviance was explained by RCPs again.
