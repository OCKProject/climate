<p id="Par5" class="p">At the species-level, the influence of SDM, GCM and RCP differed with respect to the sensitivity metric and dispersal scenario used (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). When assuming limited dispersal, the choice of SDMs causes a more than ten times higher deviance in the change of suitable habitats than the choice of the other two components. In other words, the subjective selection of a specific SDM has an overarching influence on the final result compared to the choices of GCMs and RCPs. Interestingly, when considering only the loss in climatic suitability (‘no dispersal’ scenario), RCPs are the most important element causing variation, followed by SDMs and GCMs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). The observed difference in the explained deviance between the two dispersal assumptions arises from the discrepancy in SDMs in projecting the future climatic suitability of species

 </sup>. While SDMs generally agree well when predicting the current distribution of species (as is targeted by the no dispersal assumption, Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>), they are known to widely differ when projecting future distributions

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>
 </sup>. This effect is evident even when keeping only SDMs that reach very high predictive accuracies (TSS &gt; 0.7, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). In other words, it is not only the quality of the SDMs that explains a large proportion of variance in model output, but also their internal structure. Indeed, relatively complex models (i.e. random forest) use a variety of combinations of features that can lead to similar geographical predictions under current conditions, but that can vastly differ to other models when transferred to future conditions, especially under conditions that have been used for calibrating the modes. Some of the particular combinations of features could represent true complex interactions between species’ occurrences and environmental conditions, but sometimes they could result of over-fitting and spurious combinations, that once projected in new conditions lead to misleading results. The ensemble projection of the bearded woodpecker (
 <italic class="italic">Dendropicos namaquus</italic>, Lichtenstein 1793) exemplifies this aspect (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref>). The results reveal marked differences for SDM in projected future climatic suitability which leads to difficulties when interpreting the results in the light of socio-economic pathways. On the other hand, the loss in (current) climatic suitability does not vary as much for SDM and rather show strong differences for RCP. Novel conditions are usually far away from the current range of species, which also explain that SDMs are a more important driver of over-all uncertainty when dispersal in accounted for, than when considering only current loss of suitable habitats. Interestingly, the same trend was also found to be a function of species’ range size (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). When considering dispersal, the effect of SDMs on total projection uncertainty was highest for rare species. However, when considering the loss of currently suitable climatic habitat (as is targeted by the no dispersal assumption), the influence of RCPs on projection uncertainty increases with species range sizes. For the rarest species, both SDMs and RCPs have the highest contributions to explain uncertainties, while for large-ranged species, the influence of RCPs on the total variance in future climatic suitability is largest. The same pattern emerges when considering the effects of selecting RCPs for a given GCM (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">4</xref>). Here, under limited dispersal, the deviance due to SDMs is such that there is no influence of RCPs on the final results. Only when considering the loss in climatic suitability (LCS), the effect of RCPs is discernible where the median LCS is around 65% under the RCP 8.5 and 30% under the RCP 2.6 (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">4</xref>). With regards to biodiversity management, our results indicate that only when considering the loss of currently suitable climate that one can assess the effects of climate change adaptation plans or of emission scenarios.
