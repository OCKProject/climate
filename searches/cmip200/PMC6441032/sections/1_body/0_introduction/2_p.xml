<p id="Par4" class="p">Here, we demonstrate the importance of considering multiple approaches (e.g. biodiversity models, GCMs and RCPs) but also multiple ecological decisions (e.g. quality of the data, species dispersal limitation) on biodiversity scenarios. To obtain plausible and robust results useful for biodiversity assessments like IPBES

 </sup>, we run an extensive climate change impact assessment study by modelling the current and future climatic suitability of ~11,500 vertebrate species at the global scale (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>). More specifically, we model the distribution of 1351 amphibian, 7248 bird, and 2896 mammal species as a function of current climate using four species distribution models (SDM) that are cross-validated four times and projected their future climatic suitability as a function of 14 combinations of GCMs and RCPs and for two dispersal strategies (‘no dispersal’ and ‘limited dispersal’). This totaled to five million single projections from which we define two species-level sensitivity metrics (change in climatic suitability and loss in climatic suitability better) and pixel-level variation in community metrics (change in species richness, change in spatial turnover per region and temporal turnover per pixel). We then use nested ANOVAs to disentangle the relative importance of the choices of dispersal strategies, SDMs, GCMs and RCPs on the variability of the results.
