<p id="Par3" class="p">The launch of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) in 2012 and the ongoing activities of the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) have led the ecological communities to conceive and produce biodiversity models and scenarios
 <sup class="sup">

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>
 </sup>. We define here biodiversity models as any type of quantitative model that aims at predicting the spatial or/and temporal distribution of a population, species or groups of species. Biodiversity scenarios, the application of these models to plausible trajectories of different aspects of the future (e.g. future climate), rely on several complex components that depend on each other (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> in ref. 
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>
 </sup>). When focusing on biodiversity trends under climate change, biodiversity models are first trained or fitted under current climatic conditions. Next, these models project future biodiversity patterns based on climate projections from global circulation models (GCMs) that in turn rely on socio-economic scenarios, expressed as representative concentration pathways (RCPs
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>
 </sup>). This chain of dependencies implies that the coupled choice of a GCM and a RCP is not straightforward
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>
 </sup>. Analyzing the biodiversity response with respect to RCPs is crucial to test and report how climate change and its mitigation could ultimately influence biodiversity, with consequences for management and conservation. However, the variation among climate change projections from different GCMs can be so high that the interest of choosing one RCP over another is no longer seen a necessity
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>
 </sup>. With regards to biodiversity impact modelling, the situation is even more complex since biodiversity models themselves proved to generate considerable variability
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>
 </sup>. In other words, the choice of a biodiversity model, a GCM and a RCP matters and the uncertainties originating from these choices should be considered in decision-making or biodiversity conservation. In both the climate and ecological modelling communities, researchers are generating and increasingly using ensembles of projections from a range of GCMs, biodiversity models and RCPs to quantify the uncertainty arising from these apparently subjective choices

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">7</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">8</xref>
 </sup>. However, while several studies have highlighted the potential consequences of ignoring this variability originating from different choices in biodiversity scenarios
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>
 </sup>, most studies still produce single projections based on a single biodiversity model and a single GCM and only superficially discuss their results in the light of socio-economic pathways (see e.g.

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>
 </sup>).
