<p id="Par20" class="p">Since most species have a sub-global distribution, we adjusted the area from which species are modelled and for which projections are made. In other words, for amphibian, bird and mammal species, the modelled and projected area included all grid cells within 2000, 3000 and 4000 km of species’ current distributions, respectively. This represents a maximal dispersal distance and excludes regions and climatic conditions that are outside of what is conceivably within reach for these species

 </sup>. These estimates likely underestimate the true dispersal limitation of most species but give a more reliable estimate than assuming unlimited dispersal during this century. For most analyses, we also assumed a ‘no dispersal’ scenario. This ‘no dispersal’ scenario is useful to investigate whether and where area of currently suitable climate habitat will remain to be suitable for species in the future. This is a very important aspect for in situ conservation.
