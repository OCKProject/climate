<p id="Par24" class="p">All sensitivity metrics are based on a large amount of simulations (e.g. 448 projections per species) that vary as a result cross-validation sub-setting of initial data, dispersal scenario, and choice of SDM, GCM, and RCP. First, the effects of cross-validation explained &lt;1% of total variation and thus we decided not to consider it for further analyses. Cross-validated models were considered as four independent runs of the same models. Second, since our sensitivity metrics were defined for different dispersal assumptions, we did not consider dispersal in the variance partitioning, but contrasted the results as a function of it. Finally, we partitioned the effects of SDMs, GCMs and RCPs on the final metrics using a nested ANOVA, in which SDMs were the first level, followed by GCMs and RCPs, which were considered as crossed effects (SDM/GCM:RCP). We implemented a nested ANOVA since SDMs are first fitted irrespective of GCMs and RCPs, yet they differ strongly in how they affect projected suitable habitats when applied to GCMs and RCPs. Therefore, we considered the effects from GCM and RCP as nested within the effects of SDMs. We are aware that most analyses have been done with a full factorial (non-nested) design so far. For the sake of consistency, we also performed a full-factorial ANOVA that showed the same results. Since we believe the nested ANOVA is more correct, we kept it as main effect in this study. From the nested ANOVA, we focused on the deviance explained by each component.</p>
