<p id="Par25" class="p">For the species-level sensitivity metrics, we evaluated several selection criteria below which SDMs were not retained for final ensemble projections (see Species distribution models part). Here, the nested ANOVAs were performed for three TSS thresholds (0.4, 0.6 and 0.7) and the results were compared to assess whether the explained variance that come from SDMs is driven by the quality of retained SDMs. Since we observed increasing variability caused by SDMs when using too low thresholds, we kept the highest threshold TSS (TSS = 0.7) to ensures that only very good models were retained.</p>
