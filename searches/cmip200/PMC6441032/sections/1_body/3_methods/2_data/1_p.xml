<p id="Par14" class="p">We used the distribution maps provided by the Amphibian and Mammal Red List Assessment (

Ranges were converted to 100 km × 100 km equal-area grid cells, a resolution previously validated as the finest justifiable for these data globally

 </sup>. Grid cells within the distribution range of each species were thus converted to presence points, while those outside their distribution ranges were converted as absence points. We finally focused on 1351 amphibian, 7248 bird and 2896 mammal species after removing species occurring in &lt;20 grid cells, as well as domestic and aquatic species. We consider 20 presence points the minimum to successfully fit response curves to four different predictor variables.
