<p id="Par21" class="p">All species projections under future conditions (5,149,760 in total) were converted to a metric of species sensitivity. CCS measures the relative change in climatic suitability. It corresponds to the difference between the total suitable climatic area projected into the future under the assumption of limited dispersal and the total suitable area projected under current conditions, with the resulting quantity being divided by the total suitable area projected on the current conditions. Under the ‘no dispersal’ hypothesis, we derived LCS, which measure the relative loss in climatic suitability. This metric quantifies a species’ risk of habitat loss within its current area of occupancy.</p>
