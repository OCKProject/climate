<p id="Par22" class="p">At the pixel-level, we calculated several metrics commonly used in biodiversity scenario modelling. First, we calculated the relative (percent) change in species richness (Δα-diversity) and the relative (percent) loss of species per pixel (% loss). Second, we calculated the temporal species turnover per pixel under the assumption of limited dispersal (βt = [No. of species lost + No. of species gained]/[current species richness + No. of species gained]). Finally, to be useful for the global assessment of the IPBES, we also estimated the change in spatial turnover (Δβs) within each of the IPBES-subregions (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">16</xref>), calculated as the relative (percent) change in total diversity per sub-region (γ-diversity) divided by the mean α-diversity per sub-region. Δβs was calculated under both no dispersal and limited dispersal assumptions.
