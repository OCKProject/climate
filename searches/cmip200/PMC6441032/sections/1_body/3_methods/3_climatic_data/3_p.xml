 </sup>, which provides CMIP5 scenarios at a native resolution of 30 arc seconds. Future conditions from coarser resolution GCMs had been achieved using climatologically aided interpolation. We took the difference between selected GCMs from CMIP5 at a 0.25° grid cell size for current conditions (1979–2013) and the selected future periods (2041–2060, 2061–2080) and interpolated them using b-spline interpolation to the resolution of 30 arc seconds of CHELSA. The resulting difference was then added to (for temperature) or multiplied with (for precipitation) to the CHELSA climatologies of the 1979–2013 baseline period. As our study used 100 km grid cells, the native CHELSA resolution was upscaled by calculating mean within values per each 100 km grid cell.
