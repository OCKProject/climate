<p id="Par8" class="p">In our comprehensive study, we have demonstrated the importance of considering multiple biodiversity models, multiple GCM, and, of course, multiple emission scenarios. Here, by covering the global scale and a larger range of organisms, we also demonstrate how the uncertainty in sensitivity metrics varies in space, in time, as a function of the organism, and ultimately, as a function of the sensitivity metric used. When considering sensitivity metrics that account for species dispersal capacity, the influence of the modelling algorithms becomes overwhelming. Statistical SDMs are known to markedly differ when projecting species distributions across space and time and this is why several packages include multiple algorithms to explore this variation (e.g.
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>
 </sup>). Importantly, even when selecting only the best performing models (TSS &gt; 0.7), SDMs still caused highest contributions to uncertainty, followed by GCMs, and then RCPs.
