 </sup>, a concept that provides a theoretical basis for the identification of species-specific safe areas under climate change. In that respect, targeted species translocation is sometimes advocated as a potential solution to safeguard species for conservation that would otherwise become extinct in the face of climate change

 </sup>. Our results suggest that should SDMs be used for guiding conservation translocation, it should be done carefully, since SDMs tend to cause high levels of uncertainty. Running multiple state-of-the-art SDMs forced by several GCMs seems to be the best and only option to provide ensemble future projections for assessing options for translocations. Ensemble projections provide information what areas are suitable in most models and scenarios, which reduces translocation uncertainties compared to using projections from a single SDM with a single climate forcing only.
