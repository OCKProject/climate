<p class="p">We define TSC as the time when the warming rate is undetectably different from that which we anticipate continuing for centuries (see FigureÂ

 <xref rid="grl58884-sec-0002" ref-type="sec" class="xref">2</xref>). This demarcates the transition between the period of high transience in which rapid warming accompanies increasing GHG concentrations (Rogelj et al., 
 <xref rid="grl58884-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>) and the period of steady change in which constant GHG concentrations lead to a significantly reduced rate of sustained warming (Gillett et al.,
